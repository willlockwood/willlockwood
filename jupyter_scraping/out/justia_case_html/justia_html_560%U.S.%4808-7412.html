FLORIDA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">GRAHAM <em>v</em>. FLORIDA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the district court of appeal of\nflorida, 1st district</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x937412.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 9, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 17, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and another crime.  Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sentenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt.  Subsequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms of his probation by committing additional crimes.  The trial court adjudicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his probation, and sentenced him to<em> </em>life in prison for the burglary.  Because Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham no possibility of release except executive clemency.  He challenged his sentence under the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the \xe2\x80\x9cprecept \xe2\x80\xa6 that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weems</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/index.html">217 U. S. 349</a>, 367.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases implementing the proportionality standard fall within two general classifications.  In cases of the first type, the Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime. The second classification comprises cases in which the Court has<em> </em>applied certain categorical rules against the death penalty.  In a subset of such cases considering the nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Kennedy</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  In a second subset, cases turning on the offender\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics, the Court has prohibited death for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low range, <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>.  In cases involving categorical rules, the Court first considers \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 563.  Next, looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, meaning, and purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___, the Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, <em>Roper, supra</em>, at 564.  Because this case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical approach used in <em>Atkins, Roper, </em>and <em>Kennedy</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0 Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for any juvenile offenders.  Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes.  Thirty-seven States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in some circumstances.  The State relies on these data to argue that no national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.  An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide, there are only 129 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sentences for nonhomicide crimes.  Because 77 of those offenders are serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 52 are imprisoned in just 10 States and in the federal system, it appears that only 12 jurisdictions nationwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders, while 26 States and the District of Columbia do not impose them despite apparent statutory authorization.  Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sentences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.  While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentencing practices in, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Atkins </em>and<em> Enmund</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a>, the type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposition.  The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the sentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not necessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have deliberately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate.  See <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/815/index.html">487 U. S. 815</a>, 826, n. 24, 850.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited culpability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead the Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel and unusual.  No recent data provide reason to reconsider <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment.  543 U. S., at 551.  Moreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments than are murderers.  <em>E.g., Kennedy, supra.  </em>Serious nonhomicide crimes \xe2\x80\x9cmay be devastating in their harm \xe2\x80\xa6 but \xe2\x80\x98in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 they cannot be compared to murder in their \xe2\x80\x98severity and irrevocability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___.  Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.  Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analysis.  As for the punishment, life without parole is \xe2\x80\x9cthe second most severe penalty permitted by law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harmelin</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/957/index.html">501 U. S. 957</a>, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roper, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 572.  And none of the legitimate goals of penal sanctions\xe2\x80\x94retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see <em>Ewing</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/11/index.html">538 U. S. 11</a>, 25\xe2\x80\x94is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, see, <em>e.g., Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 571, 573.  Because age \xe2\x80\x9c18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood,\xe2\x80\x9d it is the age below which a defendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  <em>Id., </em>at 574.  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that provides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9324. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two alternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional concerns.  First, although Florida and other States have made substantial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of youthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sentence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability.  Second, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offender\xe2\x80\x99s age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psychological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sentence from the many that have the capacity for change.  Cf. <em>Roper, supra</em>, at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  Nor does such an approach take account of special difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation, given juveniles\xe2\x80\x99 impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long-term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults.  A categorical rule avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.  It also gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9329. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0Additional support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion lies in the fact that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over: The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sentence.  While the judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roper, supra</em>, at 575\xe2\x80\x93578.

The sentence was imposed by the State of Florida.  Petitioner challenges the sentence under the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/index.html">370 U. S. 660</a> (1962).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham.  He was born on January 6, 1987.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s parents were addicted to crack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early years.  Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in elementary school.  He began drinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked marijuana at age 13.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three other school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida.  One youth, who worked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just before closing time.  Graham and another youth, wearing masks, entered through the unlocked door.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s masked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager in the back of the head with a metal bar.  When the manager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two youths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third accomplice.  The restaurant manager required stitches for his head injury.  No money was taken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt.  Under Florida law, it is within a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s discretion whether to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for most felony crimes.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7985.227(1)(b) (2003) (subsequently renumbered at \xc2\xa7985.557(1)(b) (2007)).  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.  The charges against Graham were armed burglary with assault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted armed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7812.13(2)(b), 777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both charges under a plea agreement.  Graham wrote a letter to the trial court.  After reciting \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my first and last time getting in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to turn my life around.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 379\xe2\x80\x93380.  Graham said \xe2\x80\x9cI made a promise to God and myself that if I get a second chance, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National Football League].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 380.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court accepted the plea agreement.  The court withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of probation.  Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of his probation in the county jail, but he received credit for the time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on June 25, 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2, 2004, Graham again was arrested.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s case was as follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a home invasion robbery.  His two accomplices were Meigo Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.  According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham, Bailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home where Carlos Rodriguez lived.  Graham, followed by Bailey and Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol to Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s chest.  For the next 30 minutes, the three held Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at gunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for money.  Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices bar-\nricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and Lawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second robbery, during which Bailey was shot.  Graham, who had borrowed his father\xe2\x80\x99s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to the hospital and left them there.  As Graham drove away, a police sergeant signaled him to stop.  Graham continued at a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole.  He tried to flee on foot but was apprehended.  Three handguns were found in his car.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied involvement in the crimes.  He said he encountered Bailey and Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot.  One of the detectives told Graham that the victims of the home invasion had identified him.  He asked Graham, \xe2\x80\x9cAside from the two robberies tonight how many more were you involved in?\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham responded, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo to three before tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 160.  The night that Graham allegedly committed the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th birthday.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 13, 2004, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s probation officer filed with the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham had violated the conditions of his probation by possessing a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with persons engaged in criminal activity.  The trial court held hearings on Graham\xe2\x80\x99s violations about a year later, in December 2005 and January 2006.  The judge who presided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea to the earlier offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the home invasion robbery; but, even after the court underscored that the admission could expose him to a life sentence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating probation conditions by fleeing.  The State presented evidence related to the home invasion, including testimony from the victims.  The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting his attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating his probation.  The court further found that Graham had violated his probation by committing a home invasion robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with persons engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court held a sentencing hearing.  Under Florida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive absent a downward departure by the judge was 5 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  The maximum was life imprisonment.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture sentence of 5 years.  A presentence report prepared by the Florida Department of Corrections recommended that Graham receive an even lower sentence\xe2\x80\x94at most 4 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  The State recommended that Graham receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years on the attempted armed robbery count.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After hearing Graham\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the trial court explained the sentence it was about to pronounce:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Graham, as I\xc2\xa0look\xc2\xa0back on your case, yours is really candidly a sad situation.  You had, as far as I can tell, you have quite a family structure.  You had a lot of people who wanted to try and help you get your life turned around including the court system, and you had a judge who took the step to try and give you direction through his probation order to give you a chance to get back onto track.  And at the time you seemed through your letters that that is exactly what you wanted to do.  And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is that you threw your life away.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did, and that is what is so sad about this today is that you have actually been given a chance to get through this, the original charge, which were very serious charges to begin with\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  The attempted robbery with a weapon was a very serious charge.</p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n a very short period of time you were back before the Court on a violation of this probation, and then here you are two years later standing before me, literally the\xe2\x80\x94facing a life sentence as to\xe2\x80\x94up to life as to count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you would be given such a great opportunity to do something with your life and why you would throw it away.  The only thing that I can rationalize is that you decided that this is how you were going to lead your life and that there is nothing that we can do for you.  And as the state pointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of criminal conduct on your part and that we can\xe2\x80\x99t help you any further.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to deter you.  This is the way you are going to lead your life, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you are going to.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve made that decision. I have no idea.  But, evidently, that is what you decided to do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo then it becomes a focus, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to help you, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to get you back on the right path, then I have to start focusing on the community and trying to protect the community from your actions.  And, unfortunately, that is where we are today is I don\xe2\x80\x99t see where I can do anything to help you any further.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve evidently decided this is the direction you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take in life, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that you made that choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI have reviewed the statute.

It sentenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law on each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery.  Because Florida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.002(1)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant no possibility of release unless he is granted executive clemency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his sentence under the Eighth Amendment.  The motion was deemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it within 60 days.  The First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed, concluding that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was not grossly disproportionate to his crimes.  982 So.\xc2\xa02d 43 (2008).  The court took note of the seriousness of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s offenses and their violent nature, as well as the fact that they \xe2\x80\x9cwere not committed by a pre-teen, but a seventeen-year-old who was ultimately sentenced at the age of nineteen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 52.  The court concluded further that Graham was incapable of rehabilitation.  Although Graham \xe2\x80\x9cwas given an unheard of probationary sentence for a life felony,\xe2\x80\x82\xe2\x80\xa6 wrote a letter expressing his remorse and promising to refrain from the commission of further crime, and \xe2\x80\xa6 had a strong family structure to support him,\xe2\x80\x9d the court noted, he \xe2\x80\x9crejected his second chance and chose to continue committing crimes at an escalating pace.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Florida Supreme Court denied review.  990 So.\xc2\xa02d 1058 (2008) (table).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari. 556 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hope</em> v. <em>Pelzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a> (2002).  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]unishments of torture,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, \xe2\x80\x9care forbidden.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilkerson</em> v. <em>Utah</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/130/index.html">99 U. S. 130</a>, 136 (1879).  These cases underscore the essential principle that, under the Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the human attributes even of those who have committed serious crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the most part, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents consider punishments challenged not as inherently barbaric but as disproportionate to the crime.  The concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.  Embodied in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ban on cruel and unusual punishments is the \xe2\x80\x9cprecept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weems</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/index.html">217 U.

The first involves challenges to the length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances in a particular case.  The second comprises cases in which the Court implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical restrictions on the death penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the first classification the Court considers all of the circumstances of the case to determine whether the sentence is unconstitutionally excessive.  Under this approach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without parole sentence for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s seventh nonviolent felony, the crime of passing a worthless check.  <em>Solem</em> v. <em>Helm</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/277/index.html">463 U. S. 277</a> (1983).  In other cases, however, it has been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of proportionality.  A leading case is <em>Harmelin</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/957/index.html">501 U. S. 957</a> (1991), in which the offender was sentenced under state law to life without parole for possessing a large quantity of cocaine.  A closely divided Court upheld the sentence.  The controlling opinion concluded that the Eighth Amendment contains a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality principle,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cforbids only extreme sentences that are \xe2\x80\x98grossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x99 to the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 997, 1000\xe2\x80\x931001 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Again closely divided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25 years to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under California\xe2\x80\x99s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme.  <em>Ewing</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/11/index.html">538 U.

The Court has also upheld a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses, <em>Rummel</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/263/index.html"></a><a href="/us/445/263/index.html">445 U.

S. 370</a> (1982) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controlling opinion in <em>Harmelin</em> explained its approach for determining whether a sentence for a term of years is grossly disproportionate for a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime.  A court must begin by comparing the gravity of the offense and the severity of the sentence.  501 U. S., at 1005 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the rare case in which [this] threshold comparison \xe2\x80\xa6 leads to an inference of gross disproportionality\xe2\x80\x9d the court should then compare the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence with the sentences received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and with the sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If this comparative analysis \xe2\x80\x9cvalidate[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly disproportionate,\xe2\x80\x9d the sentence is cruel and unusual.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em> The second classification of cases has used categorical rules to define Eighth Amendment standards.  The previous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.  The classification in turn consists of two subsets, one considering the nature of the offense, the other considering the characteristics of the offender.  With respect to the nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals.  <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at __ (slip op., at 28); see also <em>Enmund</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/782/index.html">458 U.

In cases turning on the characteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted categorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defendants who committed their crimes before the age of 18, <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a> (2005), or whose intellectual functioning is in a low range, <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a> (2002).  See also <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/815/index.html">487 U. S. 815</a> (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has taken the following approach.  The Court first considers \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 563.  Next, guided by \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, meaning, and purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kennedy</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the Court must  determine in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution.  <em>Roper, supra</em>, at 564.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case involves an issue the Court has not considered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of-years sentence.  The approach in cases such as <em>Harmelin</em> and <em>Ewing</em> is suited for considering a gross proportionality challenge to a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, but here a sentencing practice itself is in question.  This case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes.  As a result, a threshold comparison between the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does not advance the analysis.  Here, in addressing the question presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in cases that involved the categorical approach, specifically <em>Atkins, Roper, </em>and <em>Kennedy</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis begins with objective indicia of national consensus.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country\xe2\x80\x99s legislatures.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 312 (quoting <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>, 331 (1989)).  Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for any juvenile offenders.  See Appendix, <em>infra</em>, Part III.  Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes.  <em>Id.,</em> Part II.  Thirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in some circumstances.  <em>Id.,</em> Part I.  Federal law also allows for the possibility of life without parole for offenders as young as 13.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.).  Relying on this metric, the State and its <em>amici</em> argue that there is no national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is incomplete and unavailing.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are measures of consensus other than legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 22).  Actual sentencing practices are an important part of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into consensus.  See <em>Enmund</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 794\xe2\x80\x93796; <em>Thompson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 831\xe2\x80\x93832 (plurality opinion); <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 316; <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 564\xe2\x80\x93565; <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323).  Here, an examination of actual sentencing practices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is permitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.  Although these statutory schemes contain no explicit prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infrequent.  According to a recent study, nationwide there are only 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life without parole for nonhomicide offenses.  See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State contends that this study\xe2\x80\x99s tally is inaccurate because it does not count juvenile offenders who were convicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense, even when the offender received a life without parole sentence for the nonhomicide.  See Brief for Respondent 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2009, No.\xc2\xa008\xe2\x80\x937621, pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9331.  This distinction is unpersuasive.  Juvenile offenders who committed both homicide and nonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a sentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed no homicide.  It is difficult to say that a defendant who receives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who was at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some sense being punished in part for the homicide when the judge makes the sentencing determination.  The instant case concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced\nto life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida further criticizes this study because the authors were unable to obtain complete information on some States and because the study was not peer reviewed.  See Brief for Respondent 40.  The State does not, however, provide any data of its own.  Although in the first instance it is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we have been able to supplement the study\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  The study\xe2\x80\x99s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally for Nevada, Utah, or Virginia.  See Annino 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  Our research shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has none, and Virginia has eight.  See Letter from Alejandra Livingston, Offender Management Division, Nevada Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 26, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Letter from Steve Gehrke, Utah Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 29, 2010) (same); Letter from Dr. Tama S. Celi, Virginia Dept. of Corrections, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 30, 2010) (same).  The study also did not note that there are six convicts in the federal prison system serving life without parole offenses for nonhomicide crimes.  See Letter and Attachment from Judith Simon Garrett, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to Supreme Court Library (Apr. 12, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, since the study was completed, a defendant in Oklahoma has apparently been sentenced to life without parole for a rape and stabbing he committed at the age of 16.  See Stogsdill, Delaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12.  Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to those we have been able to locate independently, there are 129 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without parole sentences.  A significant majority of those, 77 in total, are serving sentences imposed in Florida.  Annino 2.  The other 52 are imprisoned in just 10 States\xe2\x80\x94California, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia\xe2\x80\x94and in the federal system.  <em>Id.,</em> at 14; <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313; Letter from Thomas P. Hoey, Dept. of Corrections, Government of the District of Columbia, to Supreme Court Library (Mar. 31, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Letter from Judith Simon Garrett, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to Supreme Court Library (Apr. 9, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Thus, only 12 jurisdictions nationwide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders\xe2\x80\x94and most of those impose the sentence quite rarely\xe2\x80\x94while 26 States as well as the District of Columbia do not impose them despite apparent statutory authorization.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The numbers cited above reflect all current convicts in a jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s penal system, regardless of when they were convicted.  It becomes all the more clear how rare these sentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do sometimes impose them, when one considers that a juvenile sentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison for decades.  Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence stretching back many years.  It is not certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile nonhomicide offender nationwide serving a life without parole sentence, for the statistics are not precise.  The available data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate how rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are isolated cases that have not been included in the presentations of the parties or the analysis of the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute numbers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomicides are more common than the sentencing practices at issue in some of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s other Eighth Amendment cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Enmund</em>, 458 U. S., at 794 (only six executions of nontriggerman felony murderers between 1954 and 1982) <em>Atkins</em>,<em> </em>536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of mentally retarded defendants in 13-year period).  This contrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first given to the base number of certain types of offenses.  For example, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult and juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes.  That same year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated assault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900 for burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for arson.  See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online at http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Although it is not certain how many of these numerous juvenile offenders were eligible for life without parole sentences, the comparison suggests that in proportion to the opportunities for its imposition, life without parole sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as other sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact that many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  The Court confronted a similar situation in <em>Thompson</em>, where a plurality concluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than 16 was unconstitutional.  A number of States then allowed the juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory scheme.  As is the case here, those States authorized the transfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at that point there was no statutory differentiation between adults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties.  The plurality concluded that the transfer laws show \xe2\x80\x9cthat the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court), <em>but tells us nothing about the judgment these States have made regarding the appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U. S., at 826, n.\xc2\xa024.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, concurring in the judgment, took a similar view.  <em>Id.,</em> at 850 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a legislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed through the adult criminal justice system, and capital punishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the death penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to such defendants\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [H]owever, it does not necessarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have deliberately concluded that it would be appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same reasoning obtains here.  Many States have chosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to allow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in, adult court under certain circumstances.  Once in adult court, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence as would be given to an adult offender, including a life without parole sentence.  But the fact that transfer and direct charging laws make life without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not justify a judgment that many States intended to subject such offenders to life without parole sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be prosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sentenced to life without parole.  The State acknowledged at oral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could receive such a sentence under the letter of the law.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  All would concede this to be unrealistic, but the example underscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.  Similarly, the many States that allow life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the punishment should not be treated as if they have expressed the view that the sentence is appropriate.  The sentencing practice now under consideration is exceedingly rare.  And \xe2\x80\x9cit is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 316.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Community consensus, while \xe2\x80\x9centitled to great weight,\xe2\x80\x9d is not itself determinative of whether a punishment is cruel and unusual.  <em>Kennedy</em>, 554 U.

Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cjuvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 569.  A juvenile is not absolved of responsibility for his actions, but his transgression \xe2\x80\x9cis not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thompson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 835 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s observations in <em>Roper</em> about the nature of juveniles.  As petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> point out, developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.  For example, parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence.  See Brief for American Medical Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9324; Brief for American Psychological Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9327.  Juveniles are more capable of change than are adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cirretrievably depraved character\xe2\x80\x9d than are the actions of adults.  <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 570.  It remains true that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor\xe2\x80\x99s character deficiencies will be reformed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  These matters relate to the status of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to consider next the nature of the offenses to which this harsh penalty might apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has recognized that defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.  <em>Kennedy,</em> <em>supra;</em> <em>Enmund</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/782/index.html">458 U.

There is a line \xe2\x80\x9cbetween homicide and other serious violent offenses against the individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kennedy</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).  Serious nonhomicide crimes \xe2\x80\x9cmay be devastating in their harm \xe2\x80\xa6 but \xe2\x80\x98in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 they cannot be compared to murder in their \xe2\x80\x98severity and irrevocability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 598 (plurality opinion)).  This is because \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ife is over for the victim of the murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d but for the victim of even a very serious nonhomicide crime, \xe2\x80\x9clife \xe2\x80\xa6 is not over and normally is not beyond repair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (plurality opinion).  Although an offense like robbery or rape is \xe2\x80\x9ca serious crime deserving serious punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Enmund</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 797, those crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.  The age of the offender and the nature of the crime each bear on the analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the punishment, life without parole is \xe2\x80\x9cthe second most severe penalty permitted by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harmelin</em>, 501 U. S., at 1001 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  It is true that a death sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cunique in its severity and irrevocability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>, 187 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); yet life without parole sentences share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.  The State does not execute the offender sentenced to life without parole, but the sentence alters the offender\xe2\x80\x99s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.  It deprives the convict of the most basic liberties without giving hope of restoration, except perhaps by executive clemency\xe2\x80\x94the remote possibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the sentence.  <em>Solem, </em>463 U. S., at 300\xe2\x80\x93301.  As one court observed in overturning a life without parole sentence for a juvenile defendant, this sentence \xe2\x80\x9cmeans denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial; it means that whatever the future might hold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he will remain in prison for the rest of his days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Naovarath</em> v. <em>State</em>, 105 Nev. 525, 526, 779 P.\xc2\xa02d 944 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that deny convicts the possibility of parole.  In <em>Rummel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/263/index.html"></a><a href="/us/445/263/index.html">445 U. S. 263</a>, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment challenge to a life sentence for a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s third nonviolent felony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant the possibility of parole.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9cparole is an established variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,\xe2\x80\x9d it was evident that an analysis of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence \xe2\x80\x9ccould hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actually be imprisoned for the rest of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And in <em>Solem</em>, the only previous case striking down a sentence for a term of years as grossly disproportionate, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was deemed \xe2\x80\x9cfar more severe than the life sentence we considered in <em>Rummel</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d because it did not give the defendant the possibility of parole.  463 U. S., at 297.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile.  Under this sentence a juvenile offender will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.  A 16-year-old and a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole receive the same punishment in name only.  See <em>Roper</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 572; cf. <em>Harmelin</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 996 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn some cases \xe2\x80\xa6 there will be negligible difference between life without parole and other sentences of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\xa6 a lengthy term sentence without eligibility for parole, given to a 65-year-old man\xe2\x80\x9d).  This reality cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The penological justifications for the sentencing practice are also relevant to the analysis.  <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 30\xe2\x80\x9336); <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 571\xe2\x80\x93572; <em>Atkin</em>s, <em>supra,</em> at 318\xe2\x80\x93320.  Criminal punishment can have different goals, and choosing among them is within a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  See <em>Harmelin,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 999 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory\xe2\x80\x9d).  It does not follow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal sanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth Amendment restrictions.  A sentence lacking any legitimate penological justification is by its nature disproportionate to the offense.  With respect to life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of penal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate\xe2\x80\x94retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see <em>Ewing</em>, 538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion)\xe2\x80\x94provides an adequate justification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it cannot support the sentence at issue here.  Society is entitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomicide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and to seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the offense.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tison</em>, 481 U. S., at 149.  And as <em>Roper</em> observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether viewed as an attempt to express the community\xe2\x80\x99s moral outrage or as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the victim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 571.  The case becomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did not commit homicide.  <em>Roper</em> found that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]etribution is not proportional if the law\xe2\x80\x99s most severe penalty is imposed\xe2\x80\x9d on the juvenile murderer.  <em>Ibid. </em> The considerations underlying that holding support as well the conclusion that retribution does not justify imposing the second most severe penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomicide offender.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence either. <em>Roper</em> noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest \xe2\x80\xa6 that juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because juveniles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9clack of maturity and underdeveloped sense of responsibility \xe2\x80\xa6 often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/350/index.html">509 U. S. 350</a>, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a possible punishment into consideration when making decisions.  This is particularly so when that punishment is rarely imposed.  That the sentence deters in a few cases is perhaps plausible, but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his argument does not overcome other objections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kennedy</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 31).  Even if the punishment has some connection to a valid penological goal, it must be shown that the punishment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justification offered.  Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide offenders\xe2\x80\x99 diminished moral responsibility, any limited deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not enough to justify the sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprisonment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in question here.  Recidivism is a serious risk to public safety, and so incapacitation is an important goal.  See <em>Ewing</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67 percent of former inmates released from state prisons are charged with at least one serious new crime within three years).  But while incapacitation may be a legitimate penological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in other contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment for juveniles who did not commit homicide.  To justify life without parole on the assumption that the juvenile offender forever will be a danger to society requires the sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorrigible.  The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment questionable.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult even for expert psychologists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 573.  As one court concluded in a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14-year-old, \xe2\x80\x9cincorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Workman</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 429 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 374, 378 (Ky. App. 1968).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an immediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume, serious crimes early in his term of supervised release and despite his own assurances of reform.  Graham deserved to be separated from society for some time in order to prevent what the trial court described as an \xe2\x80\x9cescalating pattern of criminal conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 394, but it does not follow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his life.  Even if the State\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that Graham was incorrigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or failure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate because that judgment was made at the outset.  A life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.  Incapacitation cannot override all other considerations, lest the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s rule against disproportionate sentences be a nullity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally there is rehabilitation, a penological goal that forms the basis of parole systems.  See <em>Solem,</em> 463 U. S., at 300; <em>Mistretta</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 363 (1989).  The concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility and proper implementation are the subject of a substantial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Cullen &amp; Gendreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation: Policy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000, pp. 119\xe2\x80\x93133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several decades).  It is for legislatures to determine what rehabilitative techniques are appropriate and effective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, however, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation.  The penalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal.  By denying the defendant the right to reenter the community, the State makes an irrevocable judgment about that person\xe2\x80\x99s value and place in society.  This judgment is not appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for change and limited moral culpability.  A State\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a mere expressive judgment.  As one <em>amicus</em> notes, defendants serving life without parole sentences are often denied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative services that are available to other inmates.  See Brief for Sentencing Project as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  For juvenile offenders, who are most in need of and receptive to rehabilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28\xe2\x80\x9331 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of rehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the disproportionality of the sentence all the more evident.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  This determination; the limited culpability of juvenile nonhomicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing practice under consideration is cruel and unusual.  This Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole.  This clear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood,\xe2\x80\x9d those who were below that age when the offense was committed may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime.  <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 574.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.  What the State must do, however, is give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.  It bears emphasis, however, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to release that offender during his natural life.  Those who commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for the duration of their lives.  The Eighth Amendment does not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will remain behind bars for life.  It does forbid States from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is necessary here.  Two alternative approaches are not adequate to address the relevant constitutional concerns.  First, the State argues that the laws of Florida and other States governing criminal procedure take sufficient account of the age of a juvenile offender.  Here, Florida notes that under its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and 17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious felonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those offenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors may not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders as adults for misdemeanors.  Brief for Respondent 54 (citing Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7985.227 (2003)).  The State also stresses that \xe2\x80\x9cin only the narrowest of circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d does Florida law impose no age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juveniles in adult court.  Brief for Respondent 54.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring consideration of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age in charging decisions are salutary.  An offender\xe2\x80\x99s age is relevant to the Eighth Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants\xe2\x80\x99 youthfulness into account at all would be flawed.  Florida, like other States, has made substantial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system.  See generally Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7958 <em>et seq.</em> (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by themselves insufficient to address the constitutional concerns at issue.  Nothing in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s laws prevents its courts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to life without parole based on a subjective judgment that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crimes demonstrate an \xe2\x80\x9cirretrievably depraved character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 570.  This is inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Specific cases are illustrative.  In Graham\xe2\x80\x99s case the sentencing judge decided to impose life without parole\xe2\x80\x94a sentence greater than that requested by the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x94for Graham\xe2\x80\x99s armed burglary conviction.  The judge did so because he concluded that Graham was incorrigible: \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou decided that this is how you were going to lead your life and that there is nothing that we can do for you.\xe2\x80\x82\xe2\x80\xa6  We can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to deter you.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 394.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another example comes from <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, No.\xc2\xa008\xe2\x80\x937621.  <em>Sullivan</em> was argued the same day as this case, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certiorari in <em>Sullivan</em> as improvidently granted.  <em>Post,</em> p. ___.  The facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s system.  The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as an adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13 years old.  Noting Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s past encounters with the law, the sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan had been \xe2\x80\x9cgiven opportunity after opportunity to upright himself and take advantage of the second and third chances he\xe2\x80\x99s been given,\xe2\x80\x9d he had demonstrated himself to be unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away from society for the duration of his life.  Brief for Respondent in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2009, No.\xc2\xa008\xe2\x80\x937621, p. 6.  The judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole.  As these examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing the imposition of these sentences based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the offender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life without parole sentence for which he or she lacks the moral culpability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another possible approach would be to hold that the Eighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender\xe2\x80\x99s age into consideration as part of a case-specific gross disproportionality inquiry, weighing it against the seriousness of the crime.  This approach would allow courts to account for factual differences between cases and to impose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous crimes.  Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more difficult than sentencing.  The task is usually undertaken by trial judges who seek with diligence and professionalism to take account of the human existence of the offender and the just demands of a wronged society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however, be confined by some boundaries.  The dilemma of juvenile sentencing demonstrates this.  For even if we were to assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might have \xe2\x80\x9csufficient psychological maturity, and at the same time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality approach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change.  <em>Roper</em> rejected the argument that the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be told they must consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age as a mitigating factor in sentencing.  The Court concluded that an \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of course, even where the juvenile offender\xe2\x80\x99s objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 573.  Here, as with the death penalty, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he differences between juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive\xe2\x80\x9d a sentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime \xe2\x80\x9cdespite insufficient culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it does not take account of special difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation.  As some <em>amici</em> note, the features that distinguish juveniles from adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal proceedings.  Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited understandings of the criminal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it.  They are less likely than adults to work effectively with their lawyers to aid in their defense.  Brief for NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7\xe2\x80\x9312; Henning, Loyalty, Paternalism, and Rights: Client Counseling Theory and the Role of Child\xe2\x80\x99s Counsel in Delinquency Cases, 81 Notre Dame L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 245, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (2005).  Difficulty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding impulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel seen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects, all can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juvenile offense.  Aber Brief 35.  These factors are likely to impair the quality of a juvenile defendant\xe2\x80\x99s representation.  Cf. <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 320 (\xe2\x80\x9cMentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel\xe2\x80\x9d).  A categorical rule avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide offenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.  The juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to achieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of human worth and potential.  In <em>Roper</em>, that deprivation resulted from an execution that brought life to its end.  Here, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns apply.  Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance for reconciliation with society, no hope.  Maturity can lead to that considered reflection which is the foundation for remorse, renewal, and rehabilitation.  A young person who knows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before life\xe2\x80\x99s end has little incentive to become a responsible individual.  In some prisons, moreover, the system itself becomes complicit in the lack of development.  As noted above, see <em>supra,</em> at 23, it is the policy in some prisons to withhold counseling, education, and rehabilitation programs for those who are ineligible for parole consideration.  A categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders avoids the perverse consequence in which the lack of maturity that led to an offender\xe2\x80\x99s crime is reinforced by the prison term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Terrance Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence guarantees he will die in prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain release, no matter what he might do to demonstrate that the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character, even if he spends the next half century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from his mistakes.  The State has denied him any chance to later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he was a child in the eyes of the law.  This the Eighth Amendment does not permit.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in continuing to impose life without parole sentences on juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.  This observation does not control our decision.  The judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.  But \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he climate of international opinion concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is also \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not irrelevant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Enmund</em>, 458 U. S., at 796, n.\xc2\xa022.  The Court has looked beyond our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders for support for its independent conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 575\xe2\x80\x93578; <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 317\xe2\x80\x93318, n.\xc2\xa021; <em>Thompson</em>, 487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); <em>Enmund</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 796\xe2\x80\x93797, n.\xc2\xa022; <em>Coker</em>, 433 U. S., at 596, n.\xc2\xa010 (plurality opinion); <em>Trop</em>, 356 U. S., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting the global consensus against the sentencing practice in question.  A recent study concluded that only 11 nations authorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under any circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States and Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice.  See M. Leighton &amp; C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007).  An updated version of the study concluded that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9claws allow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life terms,\xe2\x80\x9d but expressed reservations about how that parole review is implemented.  De la Vega &amp; Leighton, Sentencing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0F. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 983, 1002\xe2\x80\x931003 (2008).  But even if Israel is counted as allowing life without parole for juvenile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that sentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli prisoners whom commentators have identified as serving life sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homicide or attempted homicide.  See Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 106, n.\xc2\xa0322 (2005); Memorandum and Attachment from Ruth Levush, Law Library of Congress, to Supreme Court Library (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not contest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  We also note, as petitioner and his<em> amici</em> emphasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by every nation except the United States and Somalia, prohibits the imposition of \xe2\x80\x9clife imprisonment without possibility of release \xe2\x80\xa6 for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 66; Brief for Amnesty International et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  As we concluded in <em>Roper</em> with respect to the juvenile death penalty, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States now stands alone in a world that has turned its face against\xe2\x80\x9d life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  543 U. S., at 577.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> stress that no international legal agreement that is binding on the United States prohibits life without parole for juvenile offenders and thus urge us to ignore the international consensus.  See Brief for Solidarity Center for Law and Justice et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9316; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House of Representatives as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 40\xe2\x80\x9343.  These arguments miss the mark.  The question before us is not whether international law prohibits the United States from imposing the sentence at issue in this case.  The question is whether that punishment is cruel and unusual.  In that inquiry, \xe2\x80\x9cthe overwhelming weight of international opinion against\xe2\x80\x9d life without parole for nonhomicide offenses committed by juveniles \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 578.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The debate between petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> over whether there is a binding <em>jus cogens</em> norm against this sentencing practice is likewise of no import.  See Brief for Amnesty International 10\xe2\x80\x9323; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House of Representatives 4\xe2\x80\x9340.  The Court has treated the laws and practices of other nations and international agreements as relevant to the Eighth Amendment not because those norms are binding or controlling but because the judgment of the world\xe2\x80\x99s nations that a particular sentencing practice is inconsistent with basic principles of decency demonstrates that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale has respected reasoning to support it.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide.  A State need not guarantee the offender eventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term.  The judgment of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirming Graham\xe2\x80\x99s conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX</p>\n<p>\n\nI. \xc2\xa0JURISDICTIONS THAT PERMIT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR  JUVENILE NONHOMICIDE OFFENDERS</p>\n<p>\n<left>Alabama<left></left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nAla.

Instead, my analysis is based on an application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, in particular (1) our cases requiring \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d review of noncapital sentences and (2) our conclusion in <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/551/index.html">543 U.

The standards for relief under these precedents are rigorous, and should be.  But here Graham\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile status\xe2\x80\x94together with the nature of his criminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punishment imposed\xe2\x80\x94lead me to conclude that his sentence of life without parole is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences for noncapital crimes.  Some of my colleagues have raised serious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an original matter, the Constitution was understood to require any degree of proportionality between noncapital offenses and their corresponding punishments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Harmelin</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/957/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/957/index.html">501 U.

Neither party here asks us to reexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality, however, and so I approach this case by trying to apply our past decisions to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham\xe2\x80\x99s case arises at the intersection of two lines of Eighth Amendment precedent.  The first consists of decisions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause embraces a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality principle\xe2\x80\x9d that we apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review noncapital sentences.  <em>Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U.

This \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality principle\xe2\x80\x9d does not grant judges blanket authority to second-guess decisions made by legislatures or sentencing courts.  On the contrary, a reviewing court will only \xe2\x80\x9crarely\xe2\x80\x9d need \xe2\x80\x9cto engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence is <em>not</em> constitutionally disproportionate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Solem</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 290, n.\xc2\xa016 (emphasis added), and \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful challenges\xe2\x80\x9d to noncapital sentences will be all the more \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly rare,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/263/index.html">445 U.

This insight animated our decision in <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/815/index.html">487 U. S. 815</a> (1988), in which we invalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who had committed his crime under the age of 16.  More recently, in <em>Roper,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, we extended the prohibition on executions to those who committed their crimes before the age of 18.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both <em>Thompson</em> and <em>Roper</em> arose in the unique context of the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has recognized \xe2\x80\x9cmust be limited to those offenders who commit \xe2\x80\x98a narrow category of the most serious crimes\xe2\x80\x99 and whose extreme culpability makes them \xe2\x80\x98the most deserving of execution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 568 (quoting <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, 319 (2002)).  <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the juvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 569.  These differences are a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a heightened susceptibility to negative influences and outside pressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is \xe2\x80\x9cmore transitory\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cless fixed\xe2\x80\x9d than that of an adult.  <em>Id.</em>, at 569\xe2\x80\x93570.  Together, these factors establish the \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished culpability of juveniles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 571, and \xe2\x80\x9crender suspect any conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d that juveniles are among \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst offenders\xe2\x80\x9d for whom the death penalty is reserved, <em>id.</em>, at 570.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Court views <em>Roper</em> as providing the basis for a new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes.  I disagree.  In <em>Roper</em>, the<em> </em>Court tailored its analysis of juvenile characteristics to the specific question whether juvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to capital punishment.  Our answer that they could not be sentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion that they \xe2\x80\x9ccannot with reliability be classified among the <em>worst</em> offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 569 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can never be eligible for life without parole.  A life sentence is of course far less severe than a death sentence, and we have never required that it be imposed only on the very worst offenders, as we have with capital punishment.  Treating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment is at odds with our longstanding view that \xe2\x80\x9cthe death penalty is different from other punishments in kind rather than degree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Solem</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 294.  It is also at odds with <em>Roper</em> itself, which drew the line at capital punishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are \xe2\x80\x9cless severe than death\xe2\x80\x9d despite involving \xe2\x80\x9cforfeiture of some of the most basic liberties.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  Indeed, <em>Roper</em> explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life without parole on some juvenile offenders.  <em>Id</em>., at 572.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the fact that <em>Roper</em> does not support a categorical rule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean that a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age is irrelevant to those sentences.  On the contrary, our cases establish that the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d review applicable to noncapital cases itself takes the personal \xe2\x80\x9cculpability of the offender\xe2\x80\x9d into account in examining whether a given punishment is proportionate to the crime.  <em>Solem</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 292.  There\nis no reason why an offender\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile status should be excluded from the analysis.  Indeed, given <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than adults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile status can play a central role in the inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas disagrees with even our limited reliance on <em>Roper</em> on the ground that the present case does not involve capital punishment.  <em>Post</em>, at 26 (dissenting opinion).  That distinction is important\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it underlies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the Court.  But <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital cases, and rightly informs the case-specific inquiry I believe to be appropriate here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, our existing precedent already provides a sufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined by the majority.  Not every juvenile receiving a life sentence will prevail under this approach.  Not every juvenile should.  But all will receive the protection that the Eighth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d framework to the particular facts of this case, I conclude that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment.<font super="*">*<footcall num="*"></footcall></font></p><font super="*">\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.  There is no question that the crime for which Graham received his life sentence\xe2\x80\x94armed burglary of a nondomicil with an assault or battery\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9ca serious crime deserving serious punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Enmund</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a>, 797 (1982).  So too is the home invasion robbery that was the basis of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s probation violation.  But these crimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such as murder or rape.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for Graham\xe2\x80\x99s degree of personal culpability, he committed the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile\xe2\x80\x94a stage at which, <em>Roper</em> emphasized, one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cculpability or blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by reason of youth and immaturity.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 571.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s age places him in a significantly different category from the defendants in <em>Rummel</em>, <em>Harmelin</em>, and <em>Ewing</em>, all of whom committed their crimes as adults.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s youth made him relatively more likely to engage in reckless and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also likely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 569; <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/350/index.html">509 U. S. 350</a>, 367 (1993); <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 115\xe2\x80\x93117 (1982).  There is no reason to believe that Graham should be denied the general presumption of diminished culpability that <em>Roper</em> indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.  If anything, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s in-court statements\xe2\x80\x94including his request for a second chance so that he could \xe2\x80\x9cdo whatever it takes to get to the NFL\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94underscore his immaturity.  App. 380.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did proves that he was dangerous and deserved to be punished.  But it does not establish that he was <em>particularly</em> dangerous\xe2\x80\x94at least relative to the murderers and rapists for whom the sentence of life without parole is typically reserved.  On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, <em>ante</em>, at 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a typical adult who commits the same offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced Graham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  This is the second-harshest sentence available under our precedents for <em>any</em> crime, and the most severe sanction available for a nonhomicide offense.  See <em>Kennedy</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, 554 U. S. ___ (2008).  Indeed, as the majority notes, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed by the Florida Department of Corrections  (which suggested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20), and the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).  No one in Graham\xe2\x80\x99s case other than the sentencing judge appears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to prison for life.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that there is a strong inference that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of life imprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  I therefore proceed to the next steps of the proportionality analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence confirm the threshold inference of disproportionality.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was far more severe than that imposed for similar violations of Florida law, even without taking juvenile status into account.  For example, individuals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Florida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less than 10 years, respectively.  Florida Dept. of Corrections, Annual Report FY 2007\xe2\x80\x932008: The Guidebook to Corrections in Florida 35.  Unsurprisingly, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile criminals receive similarly low sentences\xe2\x80\x94typically less than five years for burglary and less than seven years for robbery.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s life without parole sentence was far more severe than the average sentence imposed on those convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically receive under 25 years in prison.  <em>Id</em>., at 35.  As the Court explained in <em>Solem</em>, 463 U. S., at 291, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at issue may be excessive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the inference that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is disproportionate is further validated by comparison to the sentences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions.  As the majority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its willingness to impose sentences of life without parole on juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes.

Or Nathan Walker and Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together with their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son?  See 3 Sentenced to Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14, 2009.  The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life without parole for his conduct says nothing whatever about these offenders, or others like them who commit nonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the conduct at issue here.  The Court uses Graham\xe2\x80\x99s case as a vehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule\xe2\x80\x94applicable well beyond the particular facts of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s case\xe2\x80\x94that a sentence of life without parole imposed on <em>any</em> juvenile for <em>any</em> nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional.  This categorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particular conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before us are not serious enough to justify Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.\nIn reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court to decide whether that same sentence would be constitutional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s apparent recognition that it is perfectly legitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life without parole for committing murder.  This means that there is nothing <em>inherently</em> unconstitutional about imposing sentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders; rather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on the particular crimes for which they are imposed.  But if the constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particular crime being punished, then the Court should limit its holding to the particular offenses that Graham committed here, and should decline to consider other hypothetical crimes not presented by this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s categorical conclusion is also unwise.  Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some nonhomicide crimes\xe2\x80\x94like the ones committed by Milagro Cunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor\xe2\x80\x94are especially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserving of more severe punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished\xe2\x80\x9d culpability relative to adults who commit the same crimes, <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 571, but that does not mean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify a life sentence.  See generally <em>Thompson</em>, 487 U. S., at 853 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  It does not take a moral sense that is fully developed in every respect to know that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong.  The single fact of being 17 years old would not afford Cunningham protection against life without parole if the young girl had died\xe2\x80\x94as Cunningham surely expected she would\xe2\x80\x94so why should it do so when she miraculously survived his barbaric brutality?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court defends its categorical approach on the grounds that a \xe2\x80\x9cclear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportionality review is constitutionally insufficient because courts might not be able \xe2\x80\x9cwith sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 27.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is of course correct that judges will never have perfect foresight\xe2\x80\x94or perfect wisdom\xe2\x80\x94in making sentencing decisions.  But this is true when they sentence adults no less than when they sentence juveniles.  It is also true when they sentence juveniles who commit murder no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit other crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before them.  As we explained in <em>Solem</em>, the whole enterprise of proportionality review is premised on the \xe2\x80\x9cjustified\xe2\x80\x9d assumption that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts are competent to judge the gravity of an offense, at least on a relative scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 292.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts traditionally have made these judgments\xe2\x80\x9d by applying \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally accepted criteria\xe2\x80\x9d to analyze \xe2\x80\x9cthe harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 292, 294.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which he deserves serious punishment.  But he was only 16 years old, and under our Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, his youth is one factor, among others, that should be considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally excessive.  In my view, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x94together with the nature of his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his sentence\xe2\x80\x94tips the constitutional balance.  I thus concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of life without parole violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in every case involving a juvenile offender.  Some crimes are so heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable, that a sentence of life without parole may be entirely justified under the Constitution.  As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful challenges\xe2\x80\x9d to noncapital sentences under the Eighth Amendment have been\xe2\x80\x94and, in my view, should continue to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly rare.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rummel</em>, 445 U.

Nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion affects the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the possibility of parole.  Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral argument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without the possibility of parole \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d would be constitutional.

Although petitioner asserted an as-applied proportionality challenge to his sentence before the Florida courts, see 982 So.\xc2\xa02d 43, 51\xe2\x80\x9353 (Fla.

Although the text of the Constitution is silent regarding the permissibility of this sentencing practice, and although it would not have offended the standards that prevailed at the founding, the Court insists that the standards of American society have evolved such that the Constitution now requires its prohibition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The news of this evolution will, I think, come as a surprise to the American people.  Congress, the District of Columbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to consider this sentencing practice in juvenile nonhomicide cases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it in the very worst cases they have encountered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not conclude that life without parole itself is a cruel and unusual punishment.  It instead rejects the judgments of those legislatures, judges, and juries regarding what the Court describes as the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral\xe2\x80\x9d question of whether this sentence can ever be \xe2\x80\x9cproportionat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d when applied to the category of offenders at issue here.<em>  Ante</em>, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am unwilling to assume that we, as members of this Court, are any more capable of making such moral judgments than our fellow citizens.

At age 16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked accomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida restaurant, during which one of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices twice struck the restaurant manager on the head with a steel pipe when he refused to turn over money to the intruders.  Graham was arrested and charged as an adult.  He later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including armed burglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable\nby life imprisonment under Florida law.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7810.02(2)(a), 810.02(2)(b) (2007).  The trial court withheld adjudication on both counts, however, and sentenced Graham to probation, the first 12 months of which he spent in a county detention facility.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham reoffended just six months after his release.  At a probation revocation hearing, a judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11 months, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices and held the homeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30 minutes while his accomplices ransacked the residence.  As a result, the judge concluded that Graham had violated his probation and, after additional hearings, adjudicated Graham guilty on both counts arising from the restaurant robbery.  The judge imposed the maximum sentence allowed by Florida law on the armed burglary count, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham argues, and the Court holds, that this sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause because a life-without-parole sentence is always \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d when imposed on a person under 18 who commits any crime short of a homicide.

This latter interpretation is entirely the Court\xe2\x80\x99s creation.  As has been described elsewhere at length, there is virtually no indication that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause originally was understood to require proportionality in sentencing.  See <em>Harmelin</em>, 501 U. S., at 975\xe2\x80\x93985 (opinion of Scalia,\xc2\xa0J.).  Here, it suffices to recall just two points.  First,<em> </em>the Clause does not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any synonym for that term, even though the Framers were familiar with the concept, as evidenced by several founding-era state constitutions that required (albeit without defining) proportional punishments.  See <em>id</em>., at 977\xe2\x80\x93978.  In addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Congress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was not considered a constitutional command.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See <em>id.</em>, at 980\xe2\x80\x93981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital punishment for offenses ranging from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98run[ning] away with \xe2\x80\xa6 goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmurder on the high seas\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am.

In adopting these categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes upon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state and federal) organs of government.  The Eighth Amendment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and unusual method of punishment upon a defendant.  Other constitutional provisions ensure the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to fair process before any punishment is imposed.  But, as members of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority note, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ociety changes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment leaves the unavoidably moral question of who \xe2\x80\x9cdeserves\xe2\x80\x9d a particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the prosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that impose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from the death penalty on the theory that \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards of decency\xe2\x80\x9d require this result.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court has offered assurances that these standards can be reliably measured by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective indicia\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d such as state and federal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given that we are talking about \xe2\x80\x9cnational\xe2\x80\x9d consensus) international opinion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Roper,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 563); see also <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 8\xe2\x80\x9315, 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  Yet even assuming that is true, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality of a particular type of punishment to turn on a \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot of American public opinion\xe2\x80\x9d taken at the moment a case is decided.  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 629 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  By holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one direction the evolution of the standards it describes, thus \xe2\x80\x9ccalling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pendulum swing in social attitudes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Thompson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 869 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and \xe2\x80\x9cstunt[ing] legislative con-\nsideration\xe2\x80\x9d of new questions of penal policy as they emerge, <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Alito, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of community consensus in any event.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cCommunity consensus, while \xe2\x80\x98entitled to great weight,\xe2\x80\x99 is not itself determinative\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at __ (slip op., at 24)).  Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence of consensus it finds whenever its own \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judgment\xe2\x80\x9d points in a different direction.  <em>Ante,</em> at 16.  The Court thus openly claims the power not only to approve or disapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on evidence of how society\xe2\x80\x99s standards <em>have </em>evolved, but also on the basis of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d perception of how those standards <em>should </em>evolve, which depends on what the Court concedes is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily . . . a moral judgment\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the propriety of a given punishment in today\xe2\x80\x99s society.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (quoting <em>Kennedy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The categorical proportionality review the Court employs in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today is significant because it does not merely apply this standard\xe2\x80\x94it remarkably expands its reach.  For the first time in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases alone.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, the Court has based its categorical proportionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives special protection to capital defendants because the death penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be reserved for only those who are \xe2\x80\x9cmost deserving of execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319; see <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 568; <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U.

Of course, the Eighth Amendment itself makes no distinction between capital and noncapital sentencing, but the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bright line\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court drew between the two penalties has for many years served as the principal justification for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death penalty.  See <em>Rummel</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/263/index.html">445 U. S. 263</a>, 275 (1980).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision eviscerates that distinction.  \xe2\x80\x9cDeath is different\xe2\x80\x9d no longer.  The Court now claims not only the power categorically to reserve the \xe2\x80\x9cmost severe punishment\xe2\x80\x9d for those the Court thinks are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the most deserving of execution,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roper,</em> 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting <em>Atkins,</em> 536 U. S., at 319), <em>but also </em>to declare that \xe2\x80\x9cless culpable\xe2\x80\x9d persons are categorically exempt from the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>second </em>most severe penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21 (emphasis added).  No reliable limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from immunizing any class of offenders from the law\xe2\x80\x99s third, fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s departure from the \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is different\xe2\x80\x9d distinction is especially mystifying when one considers how long it has resisted crossing that divide.  Indeed, for a time the Court declined to apply proportionality principles to noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence of death differs in kind from any sentence of imprisonment, <em>no matter how long</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rummel</em>, 445 U. S., at 272 (emphasis added).  Based on that rationale, the Court found that the excessiveness of one prison term as compared to another was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly within the province of legislatures, not courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 275\xe2\x80\x93276,<em> </em>precisely because it involved an \xe2\x80\x9c<em>invariably </em>\xe2\x80\xa6<em> subjective determination</em>, there being no clear way to make \xe2\x80\x98any constitutional distinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer term of years,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hutto</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/370/index.html">454 U. S. 370</a>, 373 (1982) <em>(per curiam)</em> (quoting <em>Rummel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 275; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even when the Court broke from that understanding in its 5-to-4 decision in <em>Solem</em> v. <em>Helm</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/277/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/277/index.html">463 U. S. 277</a> (1983) (striking down as \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d a life-without-parole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a worthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the facts of that case; it announced no categorical rule.  <em>Id., </em>at 288, 303.  Moreover, the Court soon cabined <em>Solem</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  The controlling opinion in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s very next noncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles of federalism require substantial deference to legislative choices regarding the proper length of prison sentences.  <em>Harmelin</em>,<em> </em>501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of sentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms are the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal structure\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 1000 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]iffering attitudes and perceptions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational, conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison terms for particular crimes\xe2\x80\x9d).  That opinion thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>successful</em> challenges to the proportionality of [prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They have been rare indeed.  In the 28 years since <em>Solem</em>, the Court has considered just three such challenges and has rejected them all, see <em>Ewing</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/11/index.html">538 U. S. 11</a> (2003); <em>Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U. S. 63</a> (2003); <em>Harmelin</em>, <em>supra</em>, largely on the theory that criticisms of the \xe2\x80\x9cwisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d of term-of-years prison sentences are \xe2\x80\x9cappropriately directed at the legislature[s],\xe2\x80\x9d not the courts,  <em>Ewing</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 27, 28 (plurality opinion).  The Court correctly notes that those decisions were \xe2\x80\x9cclosely divided,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, but so was <em>Solem</em> itself, and it is now fair to describe <em>Solem</em> as an outlier.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to <em>Solem</em>\xe2\x80\x99s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapital sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a <em>categorical</em> proportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences not just in this case, but in <em>every </em>case involving a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.  Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents justify this decision.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asserts that categorical proportionality review is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a categorical rule, see <em>ante</em>, at 10, and because the Court thinks clear lines are a good idea, see <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  I find those factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s break from past practice.  First, the Court fails to acknowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire category of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a much heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief under <em>Solem</em>.  Unlike the petitioner in <em>Solem</em>, Graham must establish not only that his own life-without-parole sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate,\xe2\x80\x9d but also that such a sentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is applied to a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how heinous his crime.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987).  Second, even applying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s categorical \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards\xe2\x80\x9d test, neither objective evidence of national consensus nor the notions of culpability on which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judgment\xe2\x80\x9d relies can justify the categorical rule it declares here. </p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment analysis \xe2\x80\x9cbegins with objective indicia of national consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country\xe2\x80\x99s legislatures,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As such, the analysis should end quickly, because a national \xe2\x80\x9cconsensus\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result simply does not exist.  The laws of all 50 States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9335 (Appendix to opinion of the Court).  Forty-five States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court to the very same range of punishments faced by adults charged with the same crimes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9334, Part I.  Eight of those States do not make life-without-parole sentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regardless of age.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  All remaining jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94the Federal Government, the other 37 States, and the District\xe2\x80\x94authorize life-without-parole sentences for certain nonhomicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such sentences on persons under 18.  See <em>ibid</em>.  Only <em>five </em>States prohibit juvenile offenders from receiving a life-without-parole sentence that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No plausible claim of a consensus against this sentencing practice can be made in light of this overwhelming legislative evidence.  The sole fact that federal law authorizes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our Nation finds it morally repugnant.  The additional reality that 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit the practice makes the claim utterly implausible.  Not only is there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear legislative consensus <em>in favor</em> of its availability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence aside as \xe2\x80\x9cincomplete and unavailing,\xe2\x80\x9d declaring that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]here are measures of consensus other than legislation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (quoting <em>Kennedy</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22)).  This is nothing short of stunning.  Most importantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing practice.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  And although the Court has never decided how many state laws are necessary to show consensus, the Court has never banished into constitutional exile a sentencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a supermajority, of States expressly permit.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the consistency and direction of recent leg-islation\xe2\x80\x94a factor the Court previously has relied upon when crafting categorical proportionality rules, see <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 315\xe2\x80\x93316; <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 565\xe2\x80\x93566\xe2\x80\x94underscores the consensus <em>against</em> the rule the Court announces here.  In my view, the Court cannot point to a national consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a consensus in favor of the two penological points it later discusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than similarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit nonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation through parole.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, 22\xe2\x80\x9324. <em> </em>But legislative trends make that assumption untenable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, States over the past 20 years have consistently <em>increased</em> the severity of punishments for juvenile offenders.  See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s as \xe2\x80\x9ca time of unprecedented change as State legislatures crack[ed] down on juvenile crime\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (noting that, during that period, \xe2\x80\x9clegislatures in 47 States and the District of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile justice systems more punitive,\xe2\x80\x9d principally by \xe2\x80\x9cma[king] it easier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile justice system to the [adult] criminal justice system\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 104.  This, in my view, reveals the States\xe2\x80\x99 widespread agreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same culpability as adults and that the law should permit judges and juries to consider adult sentences\xe2\x80\x94including life without parole\xe2\x80\x94in those rare and unfortunate cases.  See Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal Responsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law &amp; Family Studies 11, 69\xe2\x80\x9370 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole sentences for juveniles have increased since the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s); Amnesty International &amp; Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over the same period.  Congress abolished parole for federal offenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to \xe2\x80\x9cgamesmanship and cynicism,\xe2\x80\x9d Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180 (1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987), and several States have followed suit, see T. Hughes, D. Wilson, &amp; A. Beck, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990\xe2\x80\x932000, p. 1 (2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had abolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States had abolished it for certain ones).  In light of these developments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus that parole must be available to offenders less than 18 years old in <em>every</em> nonhomicide case simply fails.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless dismisses existing legislation, pointing out that life-without-parole sentences are rarely imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders\xe2\x80\x94129 times in recent memory[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s calculation, spread out across 11 States and the federal courts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.<em> </em>Based on this rarity of use, the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice, implying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus of a prior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures tone-deaf to moral values of their constituents that this Court claims to have easily discerned from afar.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This logic strains credulity.  It has been rejected before. <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>, 182 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment <em>per se</em>.  Rather, [it] \xe2\x80\xa6 may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases\xe2\x80\x9d).  It should also be rejected here.  That a punishment is rarely imposed demonstrates nothing more than a general consensus that it should be just that\xe2\x80\x94rarely imposed.  It is not proof that the punishment is one the Nation abhors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that authorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating a juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole sentence, cannot be counted as approving its use.  The mere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this penalty, the Court explains, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, even accepting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory, <em>federal</em> law authorizes this penalty and the Federal Government uses it.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (citing Letter and Attachment from Judith Simon Garrett, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to Supreme Court Library (Apr. 12, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file)).  That should be all the evidence necessary to refute the claim of a national consensus against this penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet even when examining the States that authorize, but have not recently employed, this sentencing practice, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory is unsound. Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s evolving standards test, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to establish a national consensus <em>approving</em> what their citizens have voted to do; rather, it is the \xe2\x80\x98heavy burden\xe2\x80\x99 of petitioners to establish a national consensus <em>against</em> it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stanford</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/361/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/361/index.html">492 U. S. 361</a>, 373 (1989) (quoting <em>Gregg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); some emphasis added).  In light of this fact, the Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s disuse of a legislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition to it.  The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this sentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the citizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility that a jury of their peers could impose a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is sufficiently depraved.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illustrates this point.  Just weeks before the release of this opinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life without parole after hearing evidence that he viciously attacked a 17-year-old girl who gave him a ride home from a party.  See Stogsdill, Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, Tulsa World, Apr. 2, 2010, p. A10; Stogsdill, Delaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12.  Budder allegedly put the girl\xe2\x80\x99s head \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98into a headlock and sliced her throat,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d raped her, stabbed her about 20 times, beat her, and pounded her face into the rocks alongside a dirt road.  Teen Gets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, at A10.  Miraculously, the victim survived.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Budder\xe2\x80\x99s crime was rare in its brutality.  The sentence the jury imposed was also rare.  According to the study relied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such offender in its prison system before Budder\xe2\x80\x99s offense.  P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14 (Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A).  Without his conviction, therefore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s citizens as morally opposed to life-without-parole sentences for juveniles nonhomicide offenders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s experience proves the inescapable flaw in that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws that allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole sentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases.  Oklahoma juries invoke those laws rarely\xe2\x80\x94in the unusual cases that they find exceptionally depraved.  I cannot agree with the Court that Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally disabled from using this sentencing practice merely because they have not done so more frequently.  If anything, the rarity of this penalty\xe2\x80\x99s use underscores just how judicious sentencing judges and juries across the country have been in invoking it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This fact is entirely consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s intuition that juveniles <em>generally</em> are less culpable and more capable of growth than adults.  See <em>infra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.<em> </em>Graham\xe2\x80\x99s own case provides another example.  Graham was statutorily eligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first crime.  But the record indicates that the trial court did not give such a sentence serious consideration at Graham\xe2\x80\x99s initial plea hearing.  It was only after Graham subsequently violated his parole by invading a home at gunpoint that the maximum sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s calculation that 129 juvenile nonhomicide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed nationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly amounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice offends our common sense of decency.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the Court finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case are stronger than those supporting at least one other penalty this Court has upheld.  Not long ago, this Court, joined by the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, upheld the application of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the fact that no such punishment had been carried out on a person of that age in this country in nearly 30 years.  See <em>Stanford</em>, 492 U. S., at 374.  Whatever the statistical frequency with which life-without-parole sentences have been imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the last 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation and the frequency of a penalty\xe2\x80\x99s use are merely ornaments in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, window dressing that accompanies its judicial fiat.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  By the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own decree, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommunity consensus \xe2\x80\xa6 is not itself determinative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.<em> </em>Only the independent moral judgment of this Court is sufficient to decide the question.

By definition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation by ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed burglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex crimes described by The Chief Justice, no longer threaten their communities.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That should settle the matter, since the Court acknowledges that incapacitation is an \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d penological goal.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.<em> </em>Yet, the Court finds this goal <em>\xe2\x80\x9cinadequate</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>to justify the life-without-parole sentences here.  <em>Ante,</em> at 22 (emphasis added).  A similar fate befalls deterrence.  The Court acknowledges that such sentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to some degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as illegitimate, but as insufficient.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny limited deterrent effect provided by life without parole is <em>not enough</em> to justify the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but laments that life-without-parole sentences do little to promote this goal because they result in the offender\xe2\x80\x99s permanent incarceration.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  Of course, the Court recognizes that rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cutility and proper implementation\xe2\x80\x9d are subject to debate.  <em>Ante,</em> at 23.  But that does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may not \xe2\x80\x9cforswea[r] \xe2\x80\xa6 the rehabilitative ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other words, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate \xe2\x80\x9cany one penological theory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted), just one the Court approves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judgment\xe2\x80\x9d and the proportionality rule itself center on retribution\xe2\x80\x94the notion that a criminal sentence should be proportioned to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the personal culpability of the criminal offender.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16, 20 (quoting <em>Tison</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/137/index.html">481 U.

The Court finds that retributive purposes are not served here for two reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, quoting <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 569\xe2\x80\x93570, the Court concludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults because, as compared to adults, they \xe2\x80\x9chave a \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctheir characters are \xe2\x80\x98not as well formed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  As a general matter, this statement is entirely consistent with the evidence recounted above that judges and juries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently, despite legislative authorization to do so in many more cases.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.  Our society tends to treat the average juvenile as less culpable than the average adult.  But the question here does not involve the average juvenile.  The question, instead, is whether the Constitution prohibits judges and juries from <em>ever</em> concluding that an offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated sufficient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his permanent incarceration.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the Court cites \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopments in psychology and brain science\xe2\x80\x9d indicating that juvenile minds \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue to mature through late adolescence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17 (citing<em> </em>Brief for American Medical Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9324;<em> </em>Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as <em>Amici</em> <em>Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9327 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that juveniles are \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely [than adults] to engage in risky behaviors,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 7.  But even if such generalizations from social science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking, the Court misstates the data on which it relies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial number of youths to engage in \xe2\x80\x9crisky\xe2\x80\x9d or antisocial behaviors with the propensity of a much smaller group to commit violent crimes.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.<em> </em>But research relied upon by the <em>amici</em> cited in the<em> </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion differentiates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a fleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pattern.  See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-Course-Persistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxonomy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA Brief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who are \xe2\x80\x9cantisocial only during adolescence\xe2\x80\x9d and a smaller group who engage in antisocial behavior \xe2\x80\x9cat every life stage\xe2\x80\x9d despite \xe2\x80\x9cdrift[ing] through successive systems aimed at curbing their deviance\xe2\x80\x9d).  That research further suggests that the pattern of behavior in the latter group often sets in before 18.  See Moffitt<em>, supra</em>, at 684 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe well-documented resistance of antisocial personality disorder to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the life-course-persistent style is fixed<em> </em>sometime<em> </em>before age 18\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evidence that an adolescent offender\xe2\x80\x99s antisocial behavior is <em>not</em> transient.  See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the Taxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-Limited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status of Criminological Theory 277, 292\xe2\x80\x93293 (F.

I find that justification entirely insufficient.  The integrity of our criminal justice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand between the defendant and an outraged public and dispassionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of punishment based on the evidence presented.  That process necessarily admits of human error.  But so does the process of judging in which we engage.  As between the two, I find far more \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court, swayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of youth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to decide for themselves when the rare case requires different treatment.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does not even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile mind.  If it did, the categorical rule it announces today would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and federal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who commit homicides.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23.  The Court thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in the psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from acquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life-without-parole sentence.  Instead, the Court rejects overwhelming legislative consensus only on the question of which<em> acts </em>are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old who pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate sufficient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8-year-old and leaves her for dead does not.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319; cf.<em> ante</em>,<em> </em>at 9 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment) (describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Milagro Cunningham).  Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that life-without-parole sentences are \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very little to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do with its perception that \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such an untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable.  The question of what acts are \xe2\x80\x9cdeserving\xe2\x80\x9d of what punishments is bound so tightly with questions of morality and social conditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question for legislative resolution.  It is true that the Court previously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding certain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capital<em> </em>punishment.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  But never before today has the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to impose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser punishment.  Its willingness to cross that well-established boundary raises the question whether any democratic choice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ever-expanding constitutional veto.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the concurrence avoids the problems associated with expanding categorical proportionality review to noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality analysis in a way that raises the same fundamental concern.  Although I do not believe <em>Solem</em> merits <em>stare decisis </em>treatment, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s claim cannot prevail even under that test (as it has been limited by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent precedents).  <em>Solem</em> instructs a court first to compare the \xe2\x80\x9cgravity\xe2\x80\x9d of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to the \xe2\x80\x9charshness of the penalty\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether an \xe2\x80\x9cinference\xe2\x80\x9d of gross disproportionality exists.  463 U. S., at 290\xe2\x80\x93291.  Only in \xe2\x80\x9cthe rare case\xe2\x80\x9d in which such an inference is present should the court proceed to the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d part of\nthe inquiry\xe2\x80\x94an intra- and interjurisdictional compari-\nson of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence with others similarly situated.  <em>Harmelin</em>, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, I fail to see how an \xe2\x80\x9cinference\xe2\x80\x9d of gross disproportionality arises here.  The concurrence notes several arguably mitigating facts\xe2\x80\x94Graham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbringing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  But the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a <em>nonviolent </em>drug crime.  See <em>Harmelin</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 1002\xe2\x80\x931004.  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for an actual violent felony is surely more severe than that offense.  As for Graham\xe2\x80\x99s age, it is true that <em>Roper</em> held juveniles categorically ineligible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence explains, <em>Roper </em>was based on the <em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em>explicit conclusion that [juveniles] \xe2\x80\x98cannot with reliability be classified among the <em>worst</em> offenders\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot establish that juveniles can never be eligible for life without parole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.)).  In my view, <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x99s principles are thus not generally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the same type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it restrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical ruling.  The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham \xe2\x80\x9cthe general presumption of diminished culpability\xe2\x80\x9d for juveniles, <em>ante</em>, at 7, apparently because it believes that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly less serious\xe2\x80\x9d than murder or rape, <em>ibid</em>.  It recoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend the same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex crime.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  I simply cannot accept that these subjective judgments of proportionality are ones the Eighth Amendment authorizes us to make.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d elements of the <em>Solem </em>test provide no additional support for the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  The concurrence compares Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d sentences in Florida and concludes that Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cfar more severe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J, concurring in judgment).  But strangely, the concurrence uses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as examples of \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d offenses, even though it seems that a run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to Graham\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history, which includes a charge for armed burglary <em>with assault</em>, <em>and </em>a probation violation for invading a home at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And even if Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is higher than ones he might have received for an armed burglary with assault in other jurisdictions, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, this hardly seems relevant if one takes seriously the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]bsent a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of federalism, some State will <em>always</em> bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other State.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harmelin</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 1000 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (quoting <em>Rummel</em>, 445 U. S., at 282; emphasis added).  Applying <em>Solem</em>, the Court has upheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under California\xe2\x80\x99s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and its <em>amici</em> could cite only \xe2\x80\x9ca single instance of a similar sentence imposed outside the context of California\xe2\x80\x99s three strikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching two million individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ewing</em>, 538 U. S., at 47 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  It has also upheld a life-without-parole sentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the fact that only one other State would have authorized such a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that State required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilograms) to trigger the penalty.  See <em>Harmelin</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 1026 (White, J., dissenting).  Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is certainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases, so his claim fails even under <em>Solem.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the Court and the concurrence claim their decisions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line-drawing problems to which courts must seek answers beyond the strictures of the Constitution.

But what, exactly, does such a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful\xe2\x80\x9d opportunity entail?  When must it occur?

The Florida Legislature has concluded that such sentences should be available for persons under 18 who commit certain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to impose that legislatively authorized sentence here.  Because a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual\xe2\x80\x9d method of punishment under any standard, the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to reject those judgments.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be unjustifiable for the Court to declare otherwise even if it could claim that a bare majority of state laws supported its independent moral view.  The fact that the Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an overwhelming legislative majority <em>in favor</em> of leaving that sentencing option available under certain cases simply il-lustrates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional principle the Court has reached to ensure that its own sense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of the people and their representatives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with Justice Stevens that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e learn, sometimes, from our mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion).

I disagree.  Both the Court and the concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality precedents to the particulars of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s claim.

But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s figures.  First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those juveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis all juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (<em>e.g.</em>, 70 or 80 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment).  It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury imposing such a long sentence\xe2\x80\x94which effectively denies the offender any material opportunity for parole\xe2\x80\x94would express moral outrage at a life-without-parole sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, the statistical information presently available would be woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule that can be revoked only by constitutional amendment.  The only evidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sentence\xe2\x80\x99s imposition was a single study completed after this Court granted certiorari in this case.  See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009).  Although I have no reason to question the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the study itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its kind.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s questionable decision to \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d the study on its own does not materially increase its reliability.  For one thing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from ever disputing its findings.  Complicating matters further, the original study sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the States themselves, see <em>ibid.;</em> the study has never been peer reviewed; and specific data on all 129 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of conviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s headcount impossible.  The Court inexplicably blames Florida for all of this.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  But as already noted, it is not Florida\xe2\x80\x99s burden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this sentencing practice, but Graham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d to prove a consensus <em>against</em> it.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I confine to a footnote the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of foreign laws and sentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such factors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discernment of any longstanding tradition in <em>this</em> Nation.  See <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 324\xe2\x80\x93325 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  Here, two points suffice.  First, despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to count the actual number of juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in other nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within our borders), the <em>laws</em> of other countries permit juvenile life-without-parole sentences,  see Child Rights Information, Network, C. de la Vega, M. Montesano, &amp; A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on Juvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3, 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cEleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the sentencing of child offenders to life without the possibility of release\xe2\x80\x9d), online at http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as visited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file)).  Second, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the world remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders tomorrow if they see fit.  Starting today, ours can count itself among the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making that choice.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, permits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of imprisonment for up to 40 years.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x931.3\xe2\x80\x93401(4)(b) (2009).  In light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently <em>permits</em> life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence of agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole hearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\xe2\x80\x937 (counsel for Graham, stating that, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur position is that it should be left up to the States to decide.  We think that the \xe2\x80\xa6 Colorado provision would probably be constitutional\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
