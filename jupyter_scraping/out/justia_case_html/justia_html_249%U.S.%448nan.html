S. 449</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 7855, Burns\' Anno. Indiana Statutes 1914, provides:</p>\n<p>"A married woman shall not enter into any contract of suretyship, whether as indorser, guarantor, or in any other manner, and such contract, as to her, shall be void."</p>\n<p>Relying upon this, defendant in error sued to recover a certificate of national bank stock issued in her name and held by plaintiff in error bank as security for her husband\'s indebtedness.  The bank defended upon the theory that, exercising rights given by \xc2\xa7 12 of the National Bank Act (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 102; Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 5139), she transferred the stock to her husband, and in turn he had hypothecated it to secure his personal note.  Being of opinion that the National Bank Act did not inhibit an inquiry concerning all the circumstances, the trial court permitted introduction of proof to that end; the jury found the bank had knowledge of facts sufficient to charge it with notice that the transaction amounted to a contract of suretyship by the wife, and judgment in her favor was affirmed by the state supreme court.  A petition to rehear was overruled May 18, 1917, and at that time the judgment below became final for purposes of review here.  <em>Andrews v. Virginian Railway Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/248/272/case.html">248 U. S. 272</a></span>; <em>Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Basham, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/164/case.html">249 U. S. 164</a></span>.  This writ of error was applied for July 13, 1917 -- within three months.</p>\n<p>Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, 727, 728, limited our power to review judgments or decrees in state courts which became final subsequent to date when it went into effect (October 6, 1916) upon writs of error to those cases</p>\n<p>"where is drawn in question the validity of treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in question the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 249 U.

Manifestly the application was not within the prescribed time.</p>\n<p>An examination of the record shows that, in the courts below, there was not really drawn in question (<em>Wilson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/169/586/case.html">169 U.
