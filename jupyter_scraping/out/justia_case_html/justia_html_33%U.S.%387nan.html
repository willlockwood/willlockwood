At the trial, several exceptions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 33 U. S. 395</a></p><p> were taken to the instruction of the court to the jury, and those exceptions are brought before this Court for its decision by a writ of error.</p>\n<p>On 15 January, 1817, Orr made a contract with the government to supply the troops of the United States with rations, &amp;c., within a certain district, and executed a bond and contract agreeably to the usages of the War Department in such cases.</p>\n<p>The action was brought upon the bond, and at the trial the plaintiffs gave in evidence the contract annexed to the bond and a Treasury statement which showed a balance against Orr of $2,012.32.</p>\n<p>And the plaintiffs also gave in evidence another transcript in order to prove that Orr, under a previous account with the United States, had been paid a balance of $19,149.01, stated to be due to him, which was paid to his agent, under a power of attorney, and the receipt for the same was endorsed on the back of the account.  And the court, on the prayer of the defendant, instructed the jury that this second transcript was not evidence <em>per se</em> to establish all the items charged to the defendant, to which instruction the plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n<p>The item principally objected to was paid to Richard Smith as the agent of Orr.

S. 396</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It appears therefore that at the time the above order was given to Smith, the contract of Orr had expired nearly a year.  The order requested the Secretary of War to pay any sum that might be due on the contract, not exceeding a specified amount.  Under this authority, the government could not pay to Smith, so as to charge Orr, a larger sum than was due on his contract.  It was neither the expectation of Smith to receive nor the intention of Orr to pay a greater amount than was due on his contract, and for any payment beyond this the government must look to the agent, and not to Orr, for repayment.</p>\n<p>It therefore appears that the circuit court did not err in its instruction above stated to the jury.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the United States, in addition to the above transcript, the power of attorney to Smith, and his receipt, proved by Smith that the money received by him under the said power of attorney was applied to the credit of Orr in the Bank of the United States at Washington, which payment the witness supposed was made known to Orr, though he could not speak positively on the subject, as he did not communicate the information to him.</p>\n<p>And the counsel who offered this evidence stated that he offered it to show that the accounts between Orr and the government under the contract of 15 January, 1817, had been settled up to that time, and that the balance of $19,149.01 had been paid to Smith as the agent of Orr, and that he offered the evidence for no other purpose.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the United States then gave in evidence to the jury a subsequent account between Orr and the government under the above contract.  And on the prayer of the defendant the court instructed the jury</p>\n<p>"That the said accounts were not competent <em>per se</em> upon which to charge the defendant or his intestate for any sums therein contained further than the mere payment of money from the Treasury to the said intestate or to his authorized agent."</p>\n<p>The items embraced by this instruction were charges made against Orr for the acts of certain persons alleged to be his agents, without annexing to the transcript copies of any papers showing their agency or offering any proof that they acted under the authority of Orr; the circuit court therefore properly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 33 U. S. 397</a></p><p> instructed the jury that the transcript <em>per se</em> did not prove these items.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs then proved by Richard Smith that he received, as the agent of Orr, $6,350.99 on warrant No. 5471 under the contract, and that the same was applied to the credit of Orr in the Bank of the United States at Washington, of which payment the witness believed Orr had notice.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the plaintiffs stated, that they confined their claim to the above item, which was the first one charged in the Treasury account marked A.  And the counsel for the defendant then moved the court to instruct the jury that this account, as also the preceding one offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, was evidence for the defendant for the items of credits contained in either, and that in claiming them, he did not admit the debits, which instruction was given by the court, and to which an exception was taken.</p>\n<p>This instruction involves the same question which has already been decided between the same parties at the present term.  There was no error in giving the instruction.</p>\n<p>In the further progress of the trial, the plaintiffs offered to withdraw from the jury the said two accounts mentioned in the preceding exception, and all the evidence connected with said accounts, to which the defendant\'s counsel objected, and the court refused the motion.</p>\n<p>A Treasury account which contains credits as well as debits is evidence for the defendant as well as government, and unless there be an abandonment of the suit by the counsel for the government, it has no right to withdraw from the jury any part of the credits relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p>The next and last instruction given by the court on the prayer of the defendant and to which the plaintiffs excepted was</p>\n<p>"That the said transcript A, from the books and proceedings of the Treasury, can only be regarded as establishing such of the items of debit in the account stated in the said transcript as are for moneys disbursed through the ordinary channels of the Treasury Department, where the transactions are shown by its books and where the officers of the department must have had official knowledge of the facts stated, but that the transcript is evidence for the defendant of the full amount </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 33 U. S. 398</a></p><p> of the credits there instated, and that by relying on the said transcript as evidence of such credits, the defendant does not admit the correctness of any of the debits in the said account, of which the transcript is not <em>per se</em> evidence, and that the said transcript is not <em>per se</em> evidence of any of the items of debit therein stated except the first."</p>\n<p>The correctness of the principle laid down by the court in this instruction has been recognized by this Court in a case between the same parties at the present term, as above referred to.</p>\n<p>As this Court sanctions all the instructions of the circuit court given to the jury in this case at the prayer of the defendant, and also in refusing to instruct on the prayer of the plaintiffs, the judgment of the circuit court is, as a matter of course,</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia holden in and for the County of Washington and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof it is ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
