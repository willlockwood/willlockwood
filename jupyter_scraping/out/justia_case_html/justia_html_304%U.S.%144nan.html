JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether the "Filled Milk Act" of Congress of March 4, 1923 (c. 262, 42 Stat. 1486, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 61-63), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] which prohibits the shipment in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 304 U. S. 146</a></p><p> interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat, so as to resemble milk or cream, transcends the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Appellee was indicted in the district court for southern Illinois for violation of the Act by the shipment in interstate commerce of certain packages of "Milnut," a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream.  The indictment states, in the words of the statute, that Milnut "is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health," and that it is not a prepared food product of the type excepted from the prohibition of the Act.  The trial court sustained a demurrer to the indictment on the authority of an earlier case in the same court, <em>United States v. Carolene Products Co.,</em> 7 F.Supp. 500.  The case was brought here on appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 682.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has meanwhile, in another case, upheld the Filled Milk Act as an appropriate exercise of the commerce power in <em>Carolene Products Co. v. Evaporated Milk Assn.,</em> 93 F. (2d) 202.</p>\n<p>Appellee assails the statute as beyond the power of Congress over interstate commerce, and hence an invasion of a field of action said to be reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.  Appellee also complains that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 304 U. S. 147</a></p><p> statute denies to it equal protection of the laws and, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, deprives it of its property without due process of law, particularly in that the statute purports to make binding and conclusive upon appellee the legislative declaration that appellee\'s product "is an adulterated article of food injurious to the public health and its sale constitutes a fraud on the public."</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  The power to regulate commerce is the power "to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html">Gibbons v. Ogden,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 1,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html#196">22 U.

The power "is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed by the Constitution."  <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html#196">22 U. S. 196</a></span>.  Hence, Congress is free to exclude from interstate commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may reasonably conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, <em>Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/45/case.html">220 U. S. 45</a></span>; <em>Hope v.

Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/334/case.html">299 U. S. 334</a></span>.  Such regulation is not a forbidden invasion of state power either because its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of commerce within the states of destination, and is not prohibited unless by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.  And it is no objection to the exertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.  <em>Seven Cases v.

The prohibition of the shipment of filled milk in interstate commerce is a permissible regulation of commerce, subject only to the restrictions of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  The prohibition of shipment of appellee\'s product in interstate commerce does not infringe the Fifth Amendment.  Twenty years ago, this Court, in <em>Hebe Co. v. Shaw,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/248/297/case.html">248 U. S. 297</a></span>, held that a state law which forbids the manufacture and sale of a product assumed to be wholesome and nutritive, made of condensed skimmed milk, compounded with coconut oil, is not forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The power of the legislature to secure a minimum of particular nutritive elements in a widely used article of food and to protect the public from fraudulent substitutions was not doubted, and the Court thought that there was ample scope for the legislative judgment that prohibition of the offending article was an appropriate means of preventing injury to the public.</p>\n<p>We see no persuasive reason for departing from that ruling here, where the Fifth Amendment is concerned, and since none is suggested, we might rest decision wholly on the presumption of constitutionality.  But affirmative evidence also sustains the statute.  In twenty years, evidence has steadily accumulated of the danger to the public health from the general consumption of foods which have been stripped of elements essential to the maintenance of health.  The Filled Milk Act was adopted by Congress after committee hearings, in the course of which eminent scientists and health experts testified.  An extensive investigation was made of the commerce in milk compounds in which vegetable oils have been substituted for natural milk fat, and of the effect upon the public health of the use of such compounds as a food substitute for milk.  The conclusions drawn from evidence presented at the hearings were embodied in reports of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 304 U. S. 149</a></p><p> House Committee on Agriculture, H.R. No. 365, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., and the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, Sen.Rep. No. 987, 67th Cong., 4th Sess. Both committees concluded, as the statute itself declares, that the use of filled milk as a substitute for pure milk is generally injurious to health and facilitates fraud on the public. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the Constitution which compels a legislature, either national or state, to ignore such evidence, nor need it disregard the other evidence which amply supports the conclusions of the Congressional committees that the danger is greatly enhanced where an inferior product, like appellee\'s, is indistinguishable from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 304 U. S. 150</a></p><p> a valuable food of almost universal use, thus making fraudulent distribution easy and protection of the consumer difficult. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 304 U. S. 151</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Here, the prohibition of the statute is inoperative unless the product is "in imitation or semblance  milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed."  Whether in such circumstances the public would be adequately protected by the prohibition of false labels and false branding imposed by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, or whether it was necessary to go farther and prohibit a substitute food product thought to be injurious to health if used as a substitute when the two are not distinguishable, was a matter for the legislative Judgment, and not that of courts.  <em>Hebe Co. v. Shaw, supra; South Carolina v. Barnwell Bros. Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/177/case.html">303 U. S. 177</a></span>.  It was upon this ground that the prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine made in imitation of butter was held not to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Powell v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/127/678/case.html">127 U. S. 678</a></span>; <em>Capital City Dairy Co. v.

The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause, and even that of the Fourteenth, applicable only to the states, does not compel their legislatures to prohibit all like evils, or none.  A legislature may hit at an abuse which it has found, even though it has failed to strike at another.  <em>Central Lumber Co. v.

There is no need to consider it here as more than a declaration of the legislative findings deemed to support and justify the action taken as a constitutional exertion of the legislative power, aiding informed judicial review, as do the reports of legislative committees, by revealing the rationale of the legislation. Even in the absence of such aids, the existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is to be presumed, for regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions is not to be pronounced unconstitutional unless, in the light of the facts made known or generally assumed, it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators.

But, by their very nature, such inquiries, where the legislative judgment is drawn in question, must be restricted to the issue whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it.  Here, the demurrer challenges the validity of the statute on its face, and it is evident from all the considerations presented to Congress, and those of which we may take judicial notice, that the question is at least debatable whether commerce in filled milk should be left unregulated, or in some measure restricted, or wholly prohibited.

(c) The term \'filled milk\' means any milk cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been added, or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated."</p>\n<p>"Section 62.  . . .  It is hereby declared that filled milk, as herein defined, is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health, and its sale constitutes a fraud upon the public.  It shall be unlawful for any person to . . . ship or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, any filled milk."</p>\n<p>Section 63 imposes as penalties for violations "a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The reports may be summarized as follows:  there is an extensive commerce in milk compounds made of condensed milk from which the butter fat has been extracted and an equivalent amount of vegetable oil, usually coconut oil, substituted.  These compounds resemble milk in taste and appearance, and are distributed in packages resembling those in which pure condensed milk is distributed.  By reason of the extraction of the natural milk fat, the compounded product can be manufactured and sold at a lower cost than pure milk.  Butter fat, which constitutes an important part of the food value of pure milk, is rich in vitamins, food elements which are essential to proper nutrition and are wanting in vegetable oils.  The use of filled milk as a dietary substitute for pure milk results, especially in the case of children, in undernourishment, and induces diseases which attend malnutrition.  Despite compliance with the branding and labeling requirements of the Pure Food and Drugs Act, there is widespread use of filled milk as a food substitute for pure milk.  This is aided by their identical taste and appearance, by the similarity of the containers in which they are sold, by the practice of dealers in offering the inferior product to customers as being as good as or better than pure condensed milk sold at a higher price, by customers\' ignorance of the respective food values of the two products, and, in many sections of the country, by their inability to read the labels placed on the containers.  Large amounts of filled milk, much of it shipped and sold in bulk, are purchased by hotels and boarding houses, and by manufacturers of food products, such as ice cream, to whose customers labeling restrictions afford no protection.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>There is now an extensive literature indicating wide recognition by scientists and dietitians of the great importance to the public health of butter fat and whole milk as the prime source of vitamins, which are essential growth producing and disease preventing elements in the diet.  <em>See</em> Dr. Henry C.
