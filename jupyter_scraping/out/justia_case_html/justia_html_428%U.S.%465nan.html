The trial court rejected respondent\'s contention that the testimony should have been excluded because the ordinance was unconstitutional and the arrest therefore invalid.  The appellate court affirmed, finding it unnecessary to pass upon the legality of the arrest and search because of the court\'s conclusion that the error, if any, in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt.  Respondent then applied for habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, which concluded that the arresting officer had probable cause, and that, even if the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutional, the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule did not require that it be applied to bar admission of the fruits of a search incident to an otherwise valid arrest.  The court held, alternatively, that any error in admission of the challenged evidence was harmless.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the ordinance was unconstitutional; that respondent\'s arrest was therefore illegal; and that, although exclusion of the evidence would serve no deterrent purpose with regard to officers who were enforcing statutes in good faith, exclusion would deter legislators from enacting unconstitutional statutes.  The court also held that admission of the evidence was not harmless error.  In No. 74-1222, respondent was also convicted of murder in a state court, in part on the basis of evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant which respondent on a suppression motion claimed was invalid.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondents in these cases were convicted of criminal offenses in state courts, and their convictions were affirmed on appeal.  The prosecution in each case relied upon evidence obtained by searches and seizures alleged by respondents to have been unlawful.  Each respondent subsequently sought relief in a Federal District Court by filing a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 428 U. S. 469</a></p><p> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254.  The question presented is whether a federal court should consider, in ruling on a petition for habeas corpus relief filed by a state prisoner, a claim that evidence obtained by an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial, when he has previously been afforded an opportunity for full and fair litigation of his claim in the state courts.  The issue is of considerable importance to the administration of criminal justice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>We summarize first the relevant facts and procedural history of these cases.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent Lloyd Powell was convicted of murder in June, 1968, after trial in a California state court.  At about midnight on February 17, 1968, he and three companions entered the Bonanza Liquor Store in San Bernardino, Cal., where Powell became involved in an altercation with Gerald Parsons, the store manager, over the theft of a bottle of wine.  In the scuffling that followed, Powell shot and killed Parsons\' wife.  Ten hours later, an officer of the Henderson, Nev., Police Department arrested Powell for violation of the Henderson vagrancy ordinance, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and in the search incident to the arrest discovered a .38-caliber revolver with six expended cartridges in the cylinder.</p>\n<p>Powell was extradited to California and convicted of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 428 U. S. 470</a></p><p> second-degree murder in the Superior Court of San Bernardino County.  Parsons and Powell\'s accomplices at the liquor store testified against him.  A criminologist testified that the revolver found on Powell was the gun that killed Parsons\' wife.  The trial court rejected Powell\'s contention that testimony by the Henderson police officer as to the search and the discovery of the revolver should have been excluded because the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutional.  In October, 1969, the conviction was affirmed by a California District Court of Appeal.  Although the issue was duly presented, that court found it unnecessary to pass upon the legality of the arrest and search because it concluded that the error, if any, in admitting the testimony of the Henderson officer was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html">386 U. S. 18</a></span> (1967).  The Supreme Court of California denied Powell\'s petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p>In August, 1971, Powell filed an amended petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, contending that the testimony concerning the .38-caliber revolver should have been excluded as the fruit of an illegal search.  He argued that his arrest had been unlawful because the Henderson vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and that the arresting officer lacked probable cause to believe that he was violating it.  The District Court concluded that the arresting officer had probable cause, and held that, even if the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutional, the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule does not require that it be applied to bar admission of the fruits of a search incident to an otherwise valid arrest.  In the alternative, that court agreed with the California District Court of Appeal that the admission of the evidence concerning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 428 U. S. 471</a></p><p> Powell\'s arrest, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>In December, 1974, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  507 F.2d 93.  The court concluded that the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] that Powell\'s arrest was therefore illegal, and that, although exclusion of the evidence would serve no deterrent purpose with regard to police officers who were enforcing statutes in good faith, exclusion would serve the public interest by deterring legislators from enacting unconstitutional statutes.  <em>Id.</em> at 98.  After an independent review of the evidence, the court concluded that the admission of the evidence was not harmless error, since it supported the testimony of Parsons and Powell\'s accomplices.  <em>Id.</em> at 99.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent David Rice was convicted of murder in April, 1971, after trial in a Nebraska state court.  At 2:05 a.m. on August 17, 1970, Omaha police received a telephone call that a woman had been heard screaming at 2867 Ohio Street.  As one of the officers sent to that address examined a suitcase lying in the doorway, it exploded, killing him instantly.  By August, 22 the investigation of the murder centered on Duane Peak, a 15-year-old member of the National Committee to Combat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 428 U. S. 472</a></p><p> Fascism (NCCF), and that afternoon, a warrant was issued for Peak\'s arrest.  The investigation also focused on other known members of the NCCF, including Rice, some of whom were believed to be planning to kill Peak before he could incriminate them.  In their search for Peak, the police went to Rice\'s home at 10:30 that night and found lights and a television on, but there was no response to their repeated knocking.  While some officers remained to watch the premises, a warrant was obtained to search for explosives and illegal weapons believed to be in Rice\'s possession.  Peak was not in the house, but, upon entering, the police discovered, in plain view, dynamite, blasting caps and other materials useful in the construction of explosive devices.  Peak subsequently was arrested, and, on August 27, Rice voluntarily surrendered.  The clothes Rice was wearing at that time were subjected to chemical analysis, disclosing dynamite particles.</p>\n<p>Rice was tried for first-degree murder in the District Court of Douglas County.  At trial, Peak admitted planting the suitcase and making the telephone call, and implicated Rice in the bombing plot.  As corroborative evidence the State introduced items seized during the search, as well as the results of the chemical analysis of Rice\'s clothing.  The court denied Rice\'s motion to suppress this evidence.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed the conviction, holding that the search of Rice\'s home had been pursuant to a valid search warrant.  <em>State v. Rice,</em> 188 Neb. 728, 199 N.W.2d 480 (1972).</p>\n<p>In September, 1972, Rice filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for Nebraska.  Rice\'s sole contention was that his incarceration was unlawful because the evidence underlying his conviction had been discovered as the result of an illegal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 428 U. S. 473</a></p><p> search of his home.  The District Court concluded that the search warrant was invalid, as the supporting affidavit was defective under <em>Spinelli v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/410/case.html">393 U. S. 410</a></span> (1969), and <em>Aguilar v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/108/case.html">378 U. S. 108</a></span> (1964).  388 F.Supp. 185, 19194 (1974). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The court also rejected the State\'s contention that, even if the warrant was invalid, the search was justified because of the valid arrest warrant for Peak and because of the exigent circumstances of the situation -- danger to Peak and search for bombs and explosives believed in possession of the NCCF.  The court reasoned that the arrest warrant did not justify the entry, as the police lacked probable cause to believe Peak was in the house, and further concluded tat the circumstances were not sufficiently exigent to justify an immediate warrantless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 428 U. S. 474</a></p><p> search.  <em>Id.</em> at 194-202. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court.  513 F.2d 1280 (1975).</p>\n<p>Petitioners Stone and Wolff, the wardens of the respective state prisons where Powell and Rice are incarcerated, petitioned for review of these decisions, raising questions concerning the scope of federal habeas corpus and the role of the exclusionary rule upon collateral review of cases involving Fourth Amendment claims.  We granted their petitions for certiorari. 4 22 U.S. 1055 (1975). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The authority of federal courts to issue the writ of habeas corpus <em>ad subjiciendum</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] was included in the first </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 428 U. S. 475</a></p><p> grant of federal court jurisdiction, made by the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 14, 1 Stat. 81, with the limitation that the writ extend only to prisoners held in custody by the United States.  The original statutory authorization did not define the substantive reach of the writ.  It merely stated that the courts of the United States "shall have power to issue writs of . . . habeas corpus. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The courts defined the scope of the writ in accordance with the common law, and limited it to an inquiry as to the jurisdiction of the sentencing tribunal.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/28/193/case.html">28 U. S. </a></span></em> 3 Pet. 193 (1830) (Marshall, C.J.).</p>\n<p>In 1867, the writ was extended to state prisoners.  Act of Feb. 5, 1867, c. 28, \xc2\xa7 1, 14 Stat. 385.  Under the 1867 Act, federal courts were authorized to give relief in</p>\n<p>"all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States. . . ."</p>\n<p>But the limitation of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction to consideration of the jurisdiction of the sentencing court persisted.  <em>See, e.g., In re Wood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/278/case.html">140 U. S. 278</a></span> (1891); <em>In re Rahrer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/545/case.html">140 U. S. 545</a></span> (1891); <em>Andrews v.

And, although the concept of "jurisdiction" was subjected to considerable strain as the substantive scope of the writ was expanded, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 428 U.

Mangum,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/309/case.html">237 U. S. 309</a></span>, in 1915.  In <em>Frank,</em> the prisoner had claimed in the state courts that the proceedings which resulted in his conviction for murder had been dominated by a mob.  After the State Supreme Court rejected his contentions, Frank unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court.  This Court affirmed the denial of relief because Frank\'s federal claims had been considered by a competent and unbiased state tribunal.  The Court recognized, however, that, if a habeas corpus court found that the State had failed to provide adequate "corrective process" for the full and fair litigation of federal claims, whether or not "jurisdictional," the court could inquire into the merits to determine whether a detention was lawful.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/309/case.html#333">237 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In that case and its companion case, <em>Daniels v. Allen,</em> state prisoners applied for federal habeas corpus relief, claiming that the trial courts had erred </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 428 U. S. 477</a></p><p> in failing to quash their indictments due to alleged discrimination in the selection of grand jurors and in ruling certain confessions admissible.  In <em>Brown,</em> the highest court of the State had rejected these claims on direct appeal, <em>State v. Brown,</em> 233 N.C. 202, 63 S.E.2d 99, and this Court had denied certiorari, 341 U.S. 943 (1951).  Despite the apparent adequacy of the state corrective process, the Court reviewed the denial of the writ of habeas corpus and held that Brown was entitled to a full reconsideration of these constitutional claims, including, if appropriate, a hearing in the Federal District Court.  In <em>Daniels,</em> however, the State Supreme Court, on direct review, had refused to consider the appeal because the papers were filed out of time.  This Court held that, since the state court judgment rested on a reasonable application of the State\'s legitimate procedural rules, a ground that would have barred direct review of his federal claims by this Court, the District Court lacked authority to grant habeas corpus relief.  <em>See</em> 344 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html#458">344 U.

Noia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html">372 U. S. 391</a></span> (1963). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Noia and two codefendants had been convicted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 428 U. S. 478</a></p><p> of felony murder.  The sole evidence against each defendant was a signed confession.  Noia\'s codefendants, but not Noia himself, appealed their convictions.  Although their appeals were unsuccessful, in subsequent state proceedings, they were able to establish that their confessions had been coerced, and their convictions therefore procured in violation of the Constitution.  In a subsequent federal habeas corpus proceeding, it was stipulated that Noia\'s confession also had been coerced, but the District Court followed <em>Daniels</em> in holding that Noia\'s failure to appeal barred habeas corpus review.  <em>See United States v. Fay,</em> 183 F.Supp. 222, 225 (SDNY 1960).  The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering that Noia\'s conviction be set aside and that he be released from custody or that a new trial be granted.  This Court affirmed the grant of the writ, narrowly restricting the circumstances in which a federal court may refuse to consider the merits of federal constitutional claims. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>During the period in which the substantive scope of the writ was expanded, the Court did not consider whether exceptions to full review might exist with respect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 428 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/217/case.html">394 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The primary rationale advanced in support of those decisions was that Fourth Amendment violations are different in kind from denials of Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights, in that claims of illegal search and seizure do not</p>\n<p>"impugn the integrity of the factfinding process or challenge evidence as inherently unreliable; rather, the exclusion of illegally seized evidence is simply a prophylactic device intended generally to deter Fourth Amendment violations by law enforcement officers."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/217/case.html#224">394 U.

The Court in <em>Elkins,</em> for example, in the context of its special supervisory role over the lower federal courts, referred to the "imperative of judicial integrity," suggesting that exclusion of illegally seized evidence prevents contamination of the judicial process.  364 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html#222">364 U.

Its purpose is to deter -- to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way -- by removing the incentive to disregard it."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html#217">364 U.

The <em>Mapp</em> majority justified the application of the rule to the States on several grounds, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] but relied principally upon the belief that exclusion would deter future unlawful police conduct. 367 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#658">367 U.

[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Logically extended, this justification would require that courts exclude unconstitutionally seized evidence despite lack of objection by the defendant, or even over his assent.  <em>Cf. Henry v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/443/case.html">379 U. S. 443</a></span> (1965).  It also would require abandonment of the standing limitations on who may object to the introduction of unconstitutionally seized evidence, <em>Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U.

Similarly, the interest in promoting judicial integrity does not prevent the use of illegally seized evidence in grand jury proceedings.  <em>United States v. Calandra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html">414 U. S. 338</a></span> (1974).  Nor does it require that the trial court exclude such evidence from use for impeachment of a defendant, even though its introduction is certain to result in conviction in some cases.  <em>Walder v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/62/case.html">347 U. S. 62</a></span> (1954).  The teaching of these cases is clear.  While courts, of course, must ever be concerned with preserving the integrity of the judicial process, this concern has limited force as a justification for the exclusion of highly probative evidence.

The decision in <em>Kaufman,</em> as noted above, is premised on the view that implementation of the Fourth Amendment also requires the consideration of search and seizure claims upon collateral review of state convictions.  But despite the broad deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule, it has never been interpreted to proscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.  As in the case of any remedial device, "the application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its remedial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 428 U. S. 487</a></p><p> objectives are thought most efficaciously served."  <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Thus, our refusal to extend the exclusionary rule to grand jury proceedings was based on a balancing of the potential injury to the historic role and function of the grand jury by such extension against the potential contribution to the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment through deterrence of police misconduct:</p>\n<p>"Any incremental deterrent effect which might be achieved by extending the rule to grand jury proceedings is uncertain, at best.  Whatever deterrence of police misconduct may result from the exclusion of illegally seized evidence from criminal trials, it is unrealistic to assume that application of the rule to grand jury proceedings would significantly further that goal.  Such an extension would deter only police investigation consciously directed toward the discovery of evidence solely for use in a grand jury investigation. . . .  We therefore decline to embrace a view that would achieve a speculative and undoubtedly minimal advance in the deterrence of police misconduct at the expense of substantially </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 428 U. S. 488</a></p><p> impeding the role of the grand jury."</p>\n<p>414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#351">414 U. S. 351</a></span>-352 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The same pragmatic analysis of the exclusionary rule\'s usefulness in a particular context was evident earlier in <em>Walder v. United States, supra,</em> where the Court permitted the Government to use unlawfully seized evidence to impeach the credibility of a defendant who had testified broadly in his own defense.  The Court held, in effect, that the interests safeguarded by the exclusionary rule in that context were outweighed by the need to prevent perjury and to assure the integrity of the trial process.  The judgment in <em>Walder</em> revealed most clearly that the policies behind the exclusionary rule are not absolute.  Rather, they must be evaluated in light of competing policies.  In that case, the public interest in determination of truth at trial [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] was deemed to outweigh the incremental contribution that might have been made to the protection of Fourth Amendment values by application of the rule.</p>\n<p>The balancing process at work in these cases also finds expression in the standing requirement.  Standing to invoke the exclusionary rule has been found to exist only when the Government attempts to use illegally obtained evidence to incriminate the victim of the illegal search.  <em>Brown v.

United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html#174">394 U. S. 174</a></span>-175. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We turn now to the specific question presented by these cases.  Respondents allege violations of Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed them through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The question is whether state prisoners -- who have been afforded the opportunity for full and fair consideration of their reliance upon the exclusionary rule with respect to seized evidence by the state courts at trial and on direct review -- may invoke their claim again on federal habeas corpus review.  The answer is to be found by weighing the utility of the exclusionary rule against the costs of extending it to collateral review of Fourth Amendment claims.</p>\n<p>The costs of applying the exclusionary rule even at trial and on direct review are well known: [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  the focus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 428 U. S. 490</a></p><p> of the trial, and the attention of the participants therein, are diverted from the ultimate question of guilt or innocence that should be the central concern in a criminal proceeding. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Moreover, the physical evidence sought to be excluded is typically reliable and often the most probative information bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  As Mr. Justice Black emphasized in his dissent in <em>Kaufman:</em></p>\n<p>"A claim of illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment is crucially different from many other constitutional rights; ordinarily, the evidence seized can in no way have been rendered untrustworthy by the means of its seizure, and indeed often this evidence alone establishes beyond virtually any shadow of a doubt that the defendant is guilty."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/217/case.html#237">394 U. S. 237</a></span>.  Application of the rule thus deflects the truthfinding process, and often frees the guilty.  The disparity in particular cases between the error committed by the police officer and the windfall afforded a guilty defendant by application of the rule is contrary to the idea of proportionality that is essential to the concept of justice. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 428 U. S. 491</a></p><p> although the rule is thought to deter unlawful police activity in part through the nurturing of respect for Fourth Amendment values, if applied indiscriminately, it may well have the opposite effect of generating disrespect for the law and administration of justice. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  These long-recognized costs of the rule persist when a criminal conviction is sought to be overturned on collateral review on the ground that a search and seizure claim was erroneously rejected by two or more tiers of state courts. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 428 U. S. 492</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Evidence obtained by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment is excluded at trial in the hope that the frequency of future violations will decrease.  Despite the absence of supportive empirical evidence, [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] we have assumed that the immediate effect of exclusion will be to discourage law enforcement officials from violating the Fourth Amendment by removing the incentive to disregard it.  More importantly, over the long-term, this demonstration that our society attaches serious consequences to violation of constitutional rights is thought to encourage those who formulate law enforcement policies, and the officers who implement them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals into their value system. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 428 U. S. 493</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We adhere to the view that these considerations support the implementation of the exclusionary rule at trial and its enforcement on direct appeal of state court convictions.  But the additional contribution, if any, of the consideration of search and seizure claims of state prisoners on collateral review is small in relation to the costs.  To be sure, each case in which such claim is considered may add marginally to an awareness of the values protected by the Fourth Amendment.  There is no reason to believe, however, that the overall educative effect of the exclusionary rule would be appreciably diminished if search and seizure claims could not be raised in federal habeas corpus review of state convictions. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Nor is there reason to assume that any specific disincentive already created by the risk of exclusion of evidence at trial or the reversal of convictions on direct review would be enhanced if there were the further risk that a conviction obtained in state court and affirmed on direct review might be overturned in collateral proceedings often occurring years after the incarceration of the defendant.  The view that the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations would be furthered rests on the dubious assumption that law enforcement authorities would fear that federal habeas review might reveal flaws in a search or seizure that went undetected at trial and on appeal. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Even if one rationally could assume that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 428 U. S. 494</a></p><p> some additional incremental deterrent effect would be present in isolated cases, the resulting advance of the legitimate goal of furthering Fourth Amendment rights would be outweighed by the acknowledged costs to other values vital to a rational system of criminal justice.</p>\n<p>In sum, we conclude that, where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  In this context, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 428 U. S. 495</a></p><p> contribution of the exclusionary rule, if any, to the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment is minimal, and the substantial societal costs of application of the rule persist with special force.

The argument is that state courts cannot be trusted to effectuate Fourth Amendment values through fair application of the rule, and the oversight jurisdiction of this Court on certiorari is an inadequate safeguard.  The principal rationale for this view emphasizes the broad differences in the respective institutional settings within which federal judges and state judges operate.  Despite differences in institutional environment and the unsympathetic attitude to federal constitutional claims of some state judges in years past, we are unwilling to assume that there now exists a general lack of appropriate sensitivity to constitutional rights in the trial and appellate courts of the several States. State courts, like federal courts, have a constitutional obligation to safeguard personal liberties and to uphold federal law.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html">Martin v.

Our decision today is not concerned with the scope of the habeas corpus statute as authority for litigating constitutional claims generally.

S. 486</a></span>, and we emphasize the minimal utility of the rule when sought to be applied to Fourth Amendment claims in a habeas corpus proceeding.  As Mr. Justice Black recognized in this context,</p>\n<p>"ordinarily, the evidence seized can in no way have been rendered untrustworthy . . . , and indeed often . . . alone establishes beyond virtually any shadow of a doubt that the defendant is guilty."</p>\n<p><em>Kaufman v.

In sum, we hold only that a federal court need not apply the exclusionary rule on habeas review of a Fourth Amendment claim absent a showing that the state prisoner was denied an opportunity for a full and fair litigation of that claim at trial and on direct review.  Our decision does not mean that the federal court lacks jurisdiction over such a claim, but only that the application of the rule is limited to cases in which there has been both such a showing and a Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T38" name="F38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F31" name="T31">n</a> 31, <em>supra.</em>  Respondents contend that, since they filed petitions for federal habeas corpus rather than seeking direct review by this Court through an application for a writ of certiorari, and since the time to apply for certiorari has now passed, any diminution in their ability to obtain habeas corpus relief on the ground evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at their trials should be prospective.  <em>Cf. England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html">375 U.

Although not required to do so under the Court\'s prior decisions, <em>see Fay v. Noia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html">372 U. S. 391</a></span> (1963), respondents were, of course, free to file a timely petition for certiorari prior to seeking federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court\'s opinion.  By way of dictum, and somewhat hesitantly, the Court notes that the holding in this case leaves undisturbed the exclusionary rule as applied to criminal trials.  For reasons stated in my dissent in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#411">403 U. S. 411</a></span> (1971), it seems clear to me that the exclusionary rule has been operative long enough to demonstrate its flaws.  The time has come to modify its reach, even if it is retained for a small and limited category of cases.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the strains imposed by reality, in terms of the costs to society and the bizarre miscarriages of justice that have been experienced because of the exclusion of reliable evidence when the "constable blunders," have led the Court to vacillate as to the rationale for deliberate exclusion of truth from the factfinding process.  The rhetoric has varied with the rationale to the point where the rule has become a doctrinaire result in search of validating reasons.</p>\n<p>In evaluating the exclusionary rule, it is important to bear in mind exactly what the rule accomplishes.  Its function is simple -- the exclusion of truth from the factfinding process.  <em>Cf.</em> M. Frankel, The Search for Truth -- An Umpireal View, 31st Annual Benjamin N. Cardozo Lecture, Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Dec. 16, 1974.  The operation of the rule is therefore unlike that of the Fifth Amendment\'s protection against compelled self-incrimination.  A confession produced after intimidating or coercive interrogation is inherently dubious.  If a suspect\'s will has been overborne, a cloud </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 428 U. S. 497</a></p><p> hangs over his custodial admissions; the exclusion of such statements is based essentially on their lack of reliability.  This is not the case as to <em>reliable</em> evidence -- a pistol, a packet of heroin, counterfeit money, or the body of a murder victim -- which may be judicially declared to be the result of an "unreasonable" search.  The reliability of such evidence is beyond question; its probative value is certain.</p>\n<p>This remarkable situation -- one unknown to the common law tradition -- had its genesis in a case calling for the protection of private papers against governmental intrusions.  <em>Boyd v. United States,</em> 116 U.-S. 616 (1886).  <em>See also Weeks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html">232 U. S. 383</a></span> (1914).  In <em>Boyd,</em> the Court held that private papers were inadmissible because of the Government\'s violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  In <em>Weeks,</em> the Court excluded private letters seized from the accused\'s home by a federal official acting without a warrant.  In both cases, the Court had a clear vision of what it was seeking to protect.  What the Court said in <em>Boyd</em> shows how far we have strayed from the original path:</p>\n<p>"The search for and seizure of stolen or forfeited goods, or goods liable to duties and concealed to avoid the payment thereof, <em>are totally different things from a search for and seizure of a man\'s private books and papers</em> for the purpose of obtaining information therein contained, or of using them as evidence against him.

In <em>Weeks,</em> the Court emphasized that the Government, under settled principles of common law, had no right to keep a person\'s <em>private papers.</em>  The Court noted that the case did not involve "burglar\'s tools or other <em>proofs of guilt.</em> . . ."  232 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#392">232 U. S. 392</a></span>.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>From this origin, the exclusionary rule has been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 428 U. S. 498</a></p><p> changed in focus entirely.  It is now used almost exclusively to exclude from evidence articles which are unlawful to be possessed or tools and instruments of crime.  Unless it can be rationally thought that the Framers considered it essential to protect the liberties of the people to hold that which it is unlawful to possess, then it becomes clear that our constitutional course has taken a most bizarre tack.</p>\n<p>The drastically changed nature of judicial concern -- from the protection of personal papers or effects in one\'s private quarters, to the exclusion of that which the accused had no right to possess -- is only one of the more recent anomalies of the rule.  The original incongruity was the rule\'s inconsistency with the general proposition that "our legal system does not attempt to do justice incidentally and to enforce penalties by indirect means."  8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7 2181, p. 6 (McNaughton ed.1961).  The rule is based on the hope that events in the courtroom or appellate chambers, long after the crucial acts took place, will somehow modify the way in which policemen conduct themselves.  A more clumsy, less direct means of imposing sanctions is difficult to imagine, particularly since the issue whether the policeman did indeed run afoul of the Fourth Amendment is often not resolved until years after the event.  The "sanction" is particularly indirect when, as in No. 74-1222, the police go before a magistrate, who issues a warrant.  Once the warrant issues, there is literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the law.  Imposing an admittedly indirect "sanction" on the police officer in that instance is nothing less than sophisticated nonsense.</p>\n<p>Despite this anomaly, the exclusionary rule now rests upon its purported tendency to deter police misconduct, <em>United States v. Janis, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html">428 U.

S. 347</a></span> (1974), although, as we know, the rule has long been applied to wholly good faith mistakes and to purely technical deficiencies in warrants.  Other rhetorical generalizations, including the "imperative of judicial integrity," have not withstood analysis as more and more critical appraisals of the rule\'s operation have appeared.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Oaks, Studying the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 665 (1970).  Indeed, settled rules demonstrate that the "judicial integrity" rationalization is fatally flawed.  First, the Court has refused to entertain claims that evidence was unlawfully seized unless the claimant could demonstrate that he had standing to press the contention.  <em>Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span> (1969).  If he could not, the evidence, albeit secured in violation of the Fourth Amendment, is admissible.  Second, as one scholar has correctly observed:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is difficult to accept the proposition that the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence is necessary for \'judicial integrity\' when no such rule is observed in other common law jurisdictions such as England and Canada, whose courts are otherwise regarded as models of judicial decorum and fairness."</p>\n<p>Oaks, <em>supra,</em> at 669.  Despite its avowed deterrent objective, proof is lacking that the exclusionary rule, a purely judge-created device based on "hard cases," serves the purpose of deterrence.  Notwithstanding Herculean efforts, no empirical study has been able to demonstrate that the rule does in fact have any deterrent effect.  In the face of dwindling support for the rule, some would go so far as to extend it to civil cases.  <em>United States v. Janis, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html">428 U. S. 433</a></span>.</p>\n<p>To vindicate the continued existence of this judge-made rule, it is incumbent upon those who seek its retention -- and surely its <em>extension</em> -- to demonstrate that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 428 U. S. 500</a></p><p> it serves its declared deterrent purpose and to show that the results outweigh the rule\'s heavy costs to rational enforcement of the criminal law.  <em>See, e.g., Killough v. United States,</em> 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241 (1962).  The burden rightly rests upon those who ask society to ignore trustworthy evidence of guilt at the expense of setting obviously guilty criminals free to ply their trade.  In my view, it is an abdication of judicial responsibility to exact such exorbitant costs from society purely on the basis of speculative and unsubstantiated assumptions.  Judge Henry Friendly has observed:</p>\n<p>"[T]he same authority that empowered the Court to supplement the [fourth] amendment by the exclusionary rule a hundred and twenty-five years after its adoption likewise allows it to modify that rule as the \'lessons of experience\' may teach."</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Calif.L.Rev. 929, 952-953 (1965).  In <em>Bivens,</em> I suggested that, despite its grave shortcomings, the rule need not be totally abandoned until some meaningful alternative could be developed to protect innocent persons aggrieved by police misconduct.  With the passage of time, it now appears that the continued existence of the rule, as presently implemented, inhibits the development of rational alternatives.  The reason is quite simple:  incentives for developing new procedures or remedies will remain minimal or nonexistent so long as the exclusionary rule is retained in its present form.  It can no longer be assumed that other branches of government will act while judges cling to this Draconian, discredited device in its present absolutist form.  Legislatures are unlikely to create statutory alternatives, or impose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 428 U. S. 501</a></p><p> direct sanctions on errant police officers or on the public treasury by way of tort actions, so long as persons who commit serious crimes continue to reap the enormous and undeserved benefits of the exclusionary rule.  And of course, by definition, the direct beneficiaries of this rule can be none but persons guilty of crimes.  With this extraordinary "remedy" for Fourth Amendment violations, however slight, inadvertent, or technical, legislatures might assume that nothing more should be done, even though a grave defect of the exclusionary rule is that it offers no relief whatever to victims of overzealous police work who never appear in court.  Schaefer, The Fourteenth Amendment and Sanctity of the Person, 4 Nw U.L.Rev. 1, 14 (1969).  And even if legislatures were inclined to experiment with alternative remedies, they have no assurance that the judicially created rule will be abolished or even modified in response to such legislative innovations.  The unhappy result, as I see it, is that alternatives will inevitably be stymied by rigid adherence on our part to the exclusionary rule.  I venture to predict that overruling this judicially contrived doctrine -- or limiting its scope to egregious, bad-faith conduct -- would inspire a surge of activity toward providing some kind of statutory remedy for persons injured by police mistakes or misconduct.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion today eloquently reflects something of the dismal social costs occasioned by the rule.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#489">428 U.

To be sure, my Brethren are hostile to the continued vitality of the exclusionary rule as part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment\'s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures, as today\'s decision in <em>United States v. Janis, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html">428 U. S. 433</a></span>, confirms.  But these cases, despite the veil of Fourth Amendment terminology employed by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 428 U. S. 503</a></p><p> Court, plainly do not involve any question of the right of a defendant to have evidence excluded from use against him in his criminal trial when that evidence was seized in contravention of rights ostensibly secured [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Rather, they involve the question of the availability of a federal form for vindicating those federally guaranteed rights.  Today\'s holding portends substantial evisceration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, and I dissent.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion does not specify the particular basis on which it denies federal habeas jurisdiction over claims of Fourth Amendment violations brought by state prisoners.  The Court insists that its holding is based on the Constitution, <em>see, e.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#482">428 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Understandably, the Court must purport to cast its holding in constitutional terms, because that avoids a direct confrontation with the incontrovertible facts that the habeas statutes have heretofore always been construed to grant jurisdiction to entertain Fourth Amendment claims of both state and federal prisoners, that Fourth Amendment principles have been applied in decisions on the merits in numerous cases on collateral review of final convictions, and that Congress has legislatively accepted our interpretation of congressional intent as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 428 U. S. 508</a></p><p> the necessary scope and function of habeas relief.  Indeed, the Court reaches its result without explicitly overruling any of our plethora of precedents inconsistent with that result or even discussing principles of <em>stare decisis.</em>  Rather, the Court asserts, in essence, that the Justices joining those prior decisions or reaching the merits of Fourth Amendment claims simply overlooked the obvious constitutional dimension to the problem in adhering to the "view" that granting collateral relief when state courts erroneously decide Fourth Amendment issues would effectuate the principles underlying that Amendment. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  But, shorn of the rhetoric of "interest balancing" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 428 U.

S. 643</a></span> (1961), remains undisturbed.</p>\n<p>Under <em>Mapp,</em> as a matter of federal constitutional law, a state court <em>must</em> exclude evidence from the trial of an individual whose Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by a search or seizure that directly or indirectly resulted in the acquisition of that evidence.  As <em>United States v. Calandra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html">414 U. S. 338</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#347">414 U.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]"</p>\n<p>When a state court admits such evidence, it has committed a <em>constitutional</em> error, and, unless that error is harmless under federal standards, <em>see, e.g., Chapman v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html">386 U. S. 18</a></span> (1967), it follows ineluctably that the defendant has been placed "in custody in violation of the Constitution" within the comprehension of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254.  In short, it escapes me as to what logic can support the assertion that the defendant\'s unconstitutional confinement obtains during the process of direct review, no matter how long that process takes, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 428 U. S. 510</a></p><p> but that the unconstitutionality then suddenly dissipates at the moment the claim is asserted in a collateral attack on the conviction.</p>\n<p>The only conceivable rationale upon which the Court\'s "constitutional" thesis might rest is the statement that</p>\n<p>"the [exclusionary] rule is not a personal constitutional right. . . .  Instead, \'the rule is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#486">428 U. S. 486</a></span>, quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#348">414 U. S. 348</a></span>.  Although my dissent in <em>Calandra</em> rejected, in light of contrary decisions establishing the role of the exclusionary rule, the premise that an individual has no constitutional right to have unconstitutionally seized evidence excluded from all use by the government, I need not dispute that point here. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  For today\'s holding is not logically defensible even under <em>Calandra.</em>  However the Court reinterprets <em>Mapp,</em> and whatever the rationale now attributed to <em>Mapp\'s</em> holding or the purpose ascribed to the exclusionary rule, the prevailing constitutional <em>rule</em> is that unconstitutionally seized evidence <em>cannot be admitted</em> in the criminal trial of a person whose federal constitutional rights were violated by the search or seizure.  The erroneous admission of such evidence is a violation of the Federal Constitution -- <em>Mapp</em> inexorably means at least this much, or there would be no basis for applying the exclusionary rule in state criminal proceedings -- and an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 428 U. S. 511</a></p><p> accused against whom such evidence is admitted has been convicted in derogation of rights mandated by, and is "in custody in violation of," the Constitution of the United States.  Indeed, since state courts violate the strictures of the Federal Constitution by admitting such evidence, then, even if federal habeas review did not directly effectuate Fourth Amendment values, a proposition I deny, that review would nevertheless serve to effectuate what is concededly a constitutional principle concerning admissibility of evidence at trial.</p>\n<p>The Court, assuming without deciding that respondents were convicted on the basis of unconstitutionally obtained evidence erroneously admitted against them by the state trial courts, acknowledges that respondents had the right to obtain a reversal of their convictions on appeal in the state courts or on certiorari to this Court.  Indeed, since our rules relating to the time limits for applying for certiorari in criminal cases are nonjurisdictional, certiorari could be granted respondents even today and their convictions could be reversed despite today\'s decisions.  <em>See also infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#533">428 U. S. 533</a></span>-534.  And the basis for reversing those convictions would of course have to be that the States, in rejecting respondents\' Fourth Amendment claims, had deprived them of a right in derogation of the Federal Constitution.  It is simply inconceivable that that constitutional deprivation suddenly vanishes after the appellate process has been exhausted.  And as between this Court on certiorari and federal district courts on habeas, it is for Congress to decide what the most efficacious method is for enforcing <em>federal</em> constitutional rights and asserting the primacy of federal law.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#522">428 U.

The Court, however, simply ignores the settled principle that, for purposes of adjudicating constitutional claims, Congress, which has the power to do so under Art. III of the Constitution, has effectively </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 428 U. S. 512</a></p><p> cast the district courts sitting in habeas in the role of surrogate Supreme Courts. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Today\'s opinion itself starkly exposes the illogic of the Court\'s seeming premise that the rights recognized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 428 U.

For the Court would not bar assertion of Fourth Amendment claims on habeas if the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 428 U.

But this "exception" is impossible if the Court really means that the "rule" that Fourth Amendment claims are not cognizable on habeas is constitutionally based.  For if the Constitution mandates that "rule" because it is a</p>\n<p>"dubious assumption that law enforcement authorities would fear that federal habeas review might reveal flaws in a search or seizure that went undetected at trial and on appeal,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#493">428 U. S. 493</a></span>, is it not an equally "dubious assumption" that those same police officials would fear that federal habeas review might reveal that the state courts had denied the defendant an opportunity to have a full and fair hearing on his claim that went undetected at trial and on appeal? [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  And to the extent the Court is making the unjustifiable assumption that our certiorari jurisdiction is adequate to correct "routine" condonation of Fourth Amendment violations by state courts, surely it follows <em>a fortiori</em> that our jurisdiction is adequate to redress the "egregious" situation in which the state courts did not even accord a fair hearing on the Fourth Amendment claim.  The "exception" thus may appear to make the holding more palatable, but it merely highlights the lack of a "constitutional" rationale for today\'s constriction of habeas jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court adheres to the holding of <em>Mapp</em> that the Constitution "require[d] exclusion" of the evidence admitted at respondents\' trials.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#481">428 U. S. 481</a></span>.  However, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 428 U.

Yet once the Constitution was interpreted by <em>Mapp</em> to require exclusion of certain evidence at trial, the Constitution became irrelevant to the manner in which that constitutional right was to be enforced in the federal courts; that inquiry is only a matter of respecting Congress\' allocation of federal judicial power between this Court\'s appellate jurisdiction and a federal district court\'s habeas jurisdiction.  Indeed, by conceding that today\'s "decision does not mean that the federal [district] court lacks jurisdiction over [respondents\'] claim[s]," <em>ibid.,</em> the Court admits that respondents have sufficiently alleged that they are "in custody in violation of the Constitution" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2254, and that there is no "constitutional" rationale for today\'s holding.  Rather, the constitutional "interest balancing" approach to this case is untenable, and I can only view the constitutional garb in which the Court dresses its result as a disguise for rejection of the longstanding principle that there are no "second class" constitutional rights for purposes of federal habeas jurisdiction; it is nothing less than an attempt to provide a veneer of respectability for an obvious usurpation of Congress\' Art. III power to delineate the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Therefore, the real ground of today\'s decision -- a ground that is particularly troubling in light of its portent for habeas jurisdiction generally -- is the Court\'s novel reinterpretation of the habeas statutes; this would read the statutes as requiring the district courts routinely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 428 U. S. 516</a></p><p> to deny habeas relief to prisoners "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws . . . of the United States" as a matter of judicial "discretion" -- a "discretion" judicially manufactured today contrary to the express statutory language -- because such claims are "different in kind" from other constitutional violations in that they "do not <em>impugn the integrity of the factfinding process,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#479">428 U.

S. 490</a></span>.  Much in the Court\'s opinion suggests that a construction of the habeas statutes to deny relief for non-"guilt-related" constitutional violations, based on this Court\'s vague notions of comity and federalism, <em>see, e.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#478">428 U. S. 478</a></span> n. 11, is the actual premise for today\'s decision, and, although the Court attempts to bury its underlying premises in footnotes, those premises mark this case as a harbinger of future eviscerations of the habeas statutes that plainly does violence to congressional power to frame the statutory contours of habeas jurisdiction.

If today\'s decision were only that erroneous state court resolution of Fourth Amendment claims did not render the defendant\'s resultant confinement "in violation of the Constitution," these pronouncements would have been wholly irrelevant and unnecessary.  I am therefore justified in apprehending that the groundwork is being laid today for a drastic withdrawal of federal habeas jurisdiction, if not for all grounds of alleged unconstitutional detention, then at least for claims -- for example, of double jeopardy, entrapment, self-incrimination, <em>Miranda</em> violations, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 428 U.

As MR JUSTICE POWELL recognized in proposing that the Court reevaluate the scope of habeas relief as a statutory matter in <em>Schneckloth v.

This Court has on numerous occasions accepted jurisdiction over collateral attacks by state prisoners premised on Fourth Amendment violations, often over dissents that as a statutory matter such claims should not be cognizable.  <em>See, e.g., Lefkowitz v.

In effect, habeas jurisdiction is a deterrent to unconstitutional actions by trial and appellate judges, and a safeguard to ensure that rights secured under the Constitution and federal laws are not merely honored in the breach.

S. 522</a></p><p> from judicial proceedings in which constitutional rights were denied has been deemed "contrary to fundamental law," and all constitutional claims have thus been cognizable on federal habeas corpus.  There is no foundation in the language or history of the habeas statutes for discriminating between types of constitutional transgressions, and efforts to relegate certain categories of claims to the status of "second-class rights" by excluding them from that jurisdiction have been repulsed. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Today\'s opinion, however, marks the triumph of those who have sought to establish a hierarchy of constitutional rights, and to deny for all practical purposes a federal forum for review of those rights that this Court deems less worthy or important.  Without even paying the slightest deference to principles of <em>stare decisis</em> or acknowledging Congress\' failure for two decades to alter the habeas statutes in light of our interpretation of congressional intent to render all federal constitutional contentions cognizable on habeas, the Court today rewrites Congress\' jurisdictional statutes as heretofore construed, and bars access to federal courts by state prisoners with constitutional claims distasteful to a majority of my Brethren.  But even ignoring principles of <em>stare decisis</em> dictating that Congress is the appropriate vehicle for embarking on such a fundamental shift in the jurisdiction of the federal courts, I can find no adequate justification elucidated by the Court for concluding that habeas relief for all federal constitutional claims is no longer compelled under the reasoning of <em>Brown, Fay,</em> and <em>Kaufman.</em></p>\n<p>I would address the Court\'s concerns for effective utilization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 428 U. S. 523</a></p><p> of scarce judicial resources, finality principles, federal-state friction, and notions of "federalism" only long enough to note that such concerns carry no more force with respect to non-"guilt-related" constitutional claims than they do with respect to claims that affect the accuracy of the factfinding process.  Congressional conferral of federal habeas jurisdiction for the purpose of entertaining petitions from state prisoners necessarily manifested a conclusion that such concerns could not be controlling, and any argument for discriminating among constitutional rights must therefore depend on the nature of the constitutional right involved.</p>\n<p>The Court, focusing on Fourth Amendment rights as it must to justify such discrimination, thus argues that habeas relief for non-"guilt-related" constitutional claims is not mandated, because such claims do not affect the "basic justice" of a defendant\'s detention, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#492">428 U. S. 492</a></span> n. 31; this is presumably because the "ultimate goal" of the criminal justice system is "truth and justice."  <em>E.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#490">428 U. S. 490</a></span>, and  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#491">428 U. S. 491</a></span> n. 30. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  This denigration of constitutional guarantees and constitutionally mandated procedures, relegated by the Court to the status of mere utilitarian tools, must appall citizens taught to expect judicial respect and support for their constitutional rights.  Even if punishment of the "guilty" were society\'s highest value -- and procedural safeguards denigrated to this end -- in a constitution that a majority of the Members of this Court would prefer, that is not the ordering of priorities under the Constitution forged by the Framers, and this Court\'s sworn duty is to uphold that Constitution, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 428 U. S. 524</a></p><p> and not to frame its own.  The procedural safeguards mandated in the Framers\' Constitution are not admonitions to be tolerated only to the extent they serve functional purposes that ensure that the "guilty" are punished and the "innocent" freed; rather, every guarantee enshrined in the Constitution, our basic charter and the guarantor of our most precious liberties, is by it endowed with an independent vitality and value, and this Court is not free to curtail those constitutional guarantees even to punish the most obviously guilty.  Particular constitutional rights that do not affect the fairness of factfinding procedures cannot for that reason be denied at the trial itself.  What possible justification then can there be for denying vindication of such rights on federal habeas when state courts do deny those rights at trial?  To sanction disrespect and disregard for the Constitution in the name of protecting society from lawbreakers is to make the government itself lawless, and to subvert those values upon which our ultimate freedom and liberty depend.

Enforcement of federal constitutional rights that redress constitutional violations directed against the "guilty" is a particular function of federal habeas review, lest judges trying the "morally unworthy" be tempted not to execute the supreme law of the land.  State judges popularly elected may have difficulty resisting popular pressures not experienced by federal judges given lifetime tenure designed to immunize them from such influences, and the federal habeas statutes reflect the congressional judgment that such detached federal review is a salutary safeguard against any detention of an individual "in violation of the Constitution or laws . . . of the United States."</p>\n<p>Federal courts have the duty to carry out the congressionally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="526">Page 428 U. S. 526</a></p><p> assigned responsibility to shoulder the ultimate burden of adjudging whether detentions violate federal law, and today\'s decision substantially abnegates that duty.  The Court does not, because it cannot, dispute that institutional constraints totally preclude any possibility that this Court can adequately oversee whether state courts have properly applied federal law, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] and does not controvert the fact that federal habeas jurisdiction is partially designed to ameliorate that inadequacy.  Thus, although I fully agree that state courts "have a constitutional obligation to safeguard personal liberties and to uphold federal law," and that there is no "general lack of appropriate sensitivity to constitutional rights in the trial and appellate courts of the several States," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#494">428 U. S. 494</a></span> n. 35, I cannot agree that it follows that, as the Court today holds, federal court determination of almost all Fourth Amendment claims of state prisoners should be barred, and that state court resolution of those issues should be insulated from the federal review Congress intended.  For, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter so aptly framed the issue in rejecting similar contentions in construing the habeas statutes in <em>Brown v. Allen, supra:</em></p>\n<p>"Congress could have left the enforcement of federal constitutional rights governing the administration of criminal justice in the States exclusively to the State courts.

But it would be in disregard of what Congress has expressly required to deny State prisoners access to the federal courts."</p>\n<p>". . .  Insofar as this jurisdiction enables federal district courts to entertain claims that State Supreme Courts have denied rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, it is not a case of a lower court sitting in judgment on a higher court.  <em>It is merely one aspect of respecting the Supremacy Clause of the</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 428 U.

S. 391</a></span> (1963), emphasized "the choice of Congress how the superior authority of federal law should be asserted" in federal courts.  <em>Townsend v. Sain</em> outlined the duty of federal habeas courts to conduct factfinding hearings with respect to petitions brought by state prisoners, and <em>Fay v. Noia</em> defined the contours of the "exhaustion of state remedies" prerequisite in \xc2\xa7 2254 in light of its purpose of according state courts the first opportunity to correct their own constitutional errors.  Congress expressly modified the habeas statutes to incorporate the <em>Townsend</em> standards so as to accord a limited and carefully circumscribed <em>res judicata</em> effect to the factual determinations of state judges.  But Congress did not alter the principle of <em>Brown, Fay,</em> and <em>Kaufman</em> that collateral relief is to be available with respect to any constitutional deprivation, and that federal district judges, subject to review in the courts of appeals and this Court, are to be the spokesmen of the supremacy of federal law.  Indeed, subsequent congressional efforts to amend those jurisdictional statutes to effectuate the result that my Brethren accomplish by judicial fiat have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 428 U. S. 529</a></p><p> consistently proved unsuccessful.  There remains, as noted before, no basis whatsoever in the language or legislative history of the habeas statutes for establishing such a hierarchy of federal rights; certainly there is no constitutional warrant in this Court to override a congressional determination respecting federal court review of decisions of state judges determining constitutional claims of state prisoners.</p>\n<p>In any event, respondents\' contention that Fourth Amendment claims, like all other constitutional claims, must be cognizable on habeas does not rest on the ground attributed to them by the Court -- that the state courts are rife with animosity to the constitutional mandates of this Court.  It is one thing to assert that state courts, as a general matter, accurately decide federal constitutional claims; it is quite another to generalize from that limited proposition to the conclusion that, despite congressional intent that federal courts sitting in habeas must stand ready to rectify any constitutional errors that are nevertheless committed, federal courts are to be judicially precluded from ever considering the merits of whole categories of rights that are to be accorded less procedural protection merely because the Court proclaims that they do not affect the accuracy or fairness of the factfinding process.</p>\n<p>"Under the guise of fashioning a procedural rule, we are not justified in wiping out the practical efficacy of a jurisdiction conferred by Congress on the District Courts.  Rules which in effect treat all these cases indiscriminately as frivolous do not fall far short of abolishing this head of jurisdiction."</p>\n<p><em>Brown v.

But to the extent federal law is erroneously applied by the state courts, there is no authority in this Court to deny defendants the right to have those errors rectified by way of federal habeas; [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] indeed, the Court\'s reluctance to accept Congress\' desires along these lines can only be a manifestation of this Court\'s mistrust for federal judges.  Furthermore, some might be expected to dispute the academic\'s dictum seemingly accepted by the Court that a federal judge is not necessarily more skilled than a state judge in applying federal law.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#494">428 U. S. 494</a></span> n. 35.  For the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution proceeds on a different premise, and Congress, as it was constitutionally empowered to do, made federal judges (and initially federal district court judges) "the primary and powerful reliances for vindicating every right given by the Constitution, the laws, and treaties of the United States."  <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html#247">389 U.

In No. 74-1055, respondent was arrested pursuant to a statute which obviously is unconstitutional under <em>Papachristou v.

Even apart from its vagueness and concomitant potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, the statute purports to criminalize the presence of one unable to account for his presence in a situation where a reasonable person might believe that public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 428 U.

It is no crime in a free society not to have "identification papers" on one\'s person, and the statute is a palpable effort to enable police to arrest individuals on the basis of mere suspicion and to facilitate detention even when there is no probable cause to believe a crime has been or is likely to be committed.  <em>See</em> 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/156/case.html#168">405 U.

Without elaborating on the various arguments buttressing this result, including the self-incrimination aspects of the ordinance and its attempt to circumvent Fourth Amendment safeguards in a situation that, under <em>Terry v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html">392 U. S. 1</a></span> (1968), would, at most, permit law enforcement officials to conduct a protective search for weapons, I would note only that the ordinance, due to the Court\'s failure to address its constitutionality today, remains in full force and effect, thereby affirmatively encouraging further Fourth Amendment violations.  Moreover, the fact that only a single state judge ever addressed the validity of the ordinance, and the lack of record evidence as to why or how he rejected respondent\'s claim, gives me pause as to whether there is any real content to the Court\'s "exception" for bringing Fourth Amendment claims on habeas in situations in which state prisoners were not accorded an opportunity for a full and fair state court resolution of those claims; that fact also makes irrelevant the Court\'s presumption that deterrence is not furthered when there is federal habeas review of a search and seizure claim that was erroneously rejected by "two or more tiers of state courts."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#491">428 U.

Indeed, the manner in which Fourth Amendment principles were applied in the Nebraska Supreme Court is paradigmatic of Congress\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 428 U. S. 532</a></p><p> concern respecting attempts by state courts to structure Fourth Amendment jurisprudence so as not to upset convictions of the "guilty" or the "unworthy."  As Judge Urbom fully detailed in two thorough and thoughtful opinions in the District Court on Rice\'s petition for habeas, the affidavit upon which the Omaha police obtained a warrant and thereby searched Rice\'s apartment was clearly deficient under prevailing constitutional standards, and no extant exception to the warrant requirement justified the search absent a valid warrant.  Yet the Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the search on the alternative and patently untenable ground that there is no Fourth Amendment violation if a defective warrant is supplemented <em>at a suppression hearing</em> by facts that theoretically could have been, but were not, presented to the issuing magistrate.  Such a construction of the Fourth Amendment would obviously abrogate the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and the principle that its</p>\n<p>"protection consists in requiring that those inferences [as to whether the data available justify an intrusion upon a person\'s privacy] be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate, instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime."</p>\n<p><em>Johnson v.

Of course, for the Court strongly to reiterate the fundamentality of this principle would only highlight the Nebraska Supreme Court\'s distortion of the Fourth Amendment in an emotionally charged case, and thereby accentuate the general potential for erroneous state court adjudication of Fourth Amendment claims. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Other aspects of today\'s decision are deserving of comment, but one particularly merits special attention.  For the Court\'s failure to limit today\'s ruling to prospective application stands in sharp contrast to recent cases that have so limited decisions expanding or affirming constitutional rights.  Respondents, relying on the explicit holding of <em>Fay v. Noia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html">372 U. S. 391</a></span> (1963), that a petition for a writ of certiorari is not a necessary predicate for federal habeas relief, and accepting at face value the clear import of our prior habeas cases that all unconstitutional confinements may be challenged on federal habeas, contend that any new restriction on state prisoners\' ability to obtain habeas relief should be held to be prospective only.  The Court, however, dismisses respondents\' effective inability to have a single federal court pass on their federal constitutional claims with the offhand remark that "respondents were, of course, free to file a timely petition for certiorari prior to seeking federal habeas corpus relief."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#495">428 U. S. 495</a></span> n. 38.  To be sure, the fact that the time limits for invoking our certiorari jurisdiction with respect to criminal cases emanating from state courts are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 428 U. S. 534</a></p><p> <em>non</em>-jurisdictional would dictate that respondents are at least free to file out-of-time certiorari petitions; under the Court\'s "direct review" distinction delineated today, we would still have authority to address the substance of respondents\' eminently and concededly meritorious Fourth Amendment claims.  Of course, federal review by certiorari in this Court is a matter of grace, and it is grace now seldom bestowed at the behest of a criminal defendant.  I have little confidence that three others of the Brethren would join in voting to grant such petitions, thereby reinforcing the notorious fact that our certiorari jurisdiction is inadequate for containing state criminal proceedings within constitutional bounds, and underscoring Congress\' wisdom in mandating a broad federal habeas jurisdiction for the district courts.  In any event, since we are fully familiar with the records in these cases, respondents are owed at least review in this Court, particularly since it shuts the doors of the district courts in a decision that marks such a stark break with out precedents on the scope of habeas relief; indeed, if the Court were at all disposed to safeguard constitutional rights and educate state and federal judges concerning the contours of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in various situations, it would decide these cases on the merits, rather than employ a procedural ruse that ensures respondents\' continued unconstitutional confinement.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In summary, while, unlike the Court, I consider that the exclusionary rule is a constitutional ingredient of the Fourth Amendment, any modification of that rule should at least be accomplished with some modicum of logic and justification not provided today.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Dershowitz &amp; Ely, <em>Harris v. New York:</em>  Some Anxious Observations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 428 U. S. 535</a></p><p> on the Candor and Logic of the Emerging Nixon Majority, 80 Yale L.J. 1198 (1971).  The Court does not disturb the holding of <em>Mapp v. Ohio</em> that, as a, matter of federal constitutional law, illegally obtained evidence must be excluded from the trial of a criminal defendant whose rights were transgressed during the search that resulted in acquisition of the evidence.  In light of that constitutional rule it is a matter for Congress, not this Court, to prescribe what federal courts are to review state prisoners\' claims of constitutional error committed by state courts.  Until this decision, our cases have never departed from the construction of the habeas statutes as embodying a congressional intent that, however substantive constitutional rights are delineated or expanded, those rights may be asserted as a procedural matter under federal habeas jurisdiction.  Employing the transparent tactic that today\'s is a decision construing the Constitution, the Court usurps the authority -- vested by the Constitution in the Congress -- to reassign federal judicial responsibility for reviewing state prisoners\' claims of failure of state courts to redress violations of their Fourth Amendment rights.  Our jurisdiction is eminently unsuited for that task, and, as a practical matter, the only result of today\'s holding will be that denials by the state courts of claims by state prisoners of violations of their Fourth Amendment rights will go unreviewed by a federal tribunal.  I fear that the same treatment ultimately will be accorded state prisoners\' claims of violations of other constitutional rights; thus, the potential ramifications of this case for federal habeas jurisdiction generally are ominous.  The Court, no longer content just to restrict forthrightly the constitutional rights of the citizenry, has embarked on a campaign to water down even such constitutional rights as it purports to acknowledge </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 428 U. S. 536</a></p><p> by the device of foreclosing resort to the federal habeas remedy for their redress.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I say "ostensibly" secured both because it is clear that the Court has yet to make its final frontal assault on the exclusionary rule, and because the Court has recently moved in the direction of holding that the Fourth Amendment has no substantive content whatsoever.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

For to the extent Congress has accorded the federal district courts a role in our constitutional scheme functionally equivalent to that of the Supreme Court with respect to review of state court resolutions of federal constitutional claims, it is evident that the Court\'s direct/collateral review distinction for constitutional purposes simply collapses.  Indeed, logically extended, the Court\'s analysis, which basically turns on the fact that law enforcement officials cannot anticipate a second court\'s finding constitutional errors after one court has fully and fairly adjudicated the claim and found it to be meritless, would preclude any Supreme Court review on direct appeal, or even state appellate review if the trial court fairly addressed the Fourth Amendment claim on the merits.  The proposition is certainly frivolous if <em>Mapp</em> is constitutionally grounded; yet such is the essential thrust of the Court\'s view that the unconstitutional admission of evidence is tolerable merely because police official.s cannot be deterred from unconstitutional conduct by the possibility that a favorable "admission" decision would be followed by an unfavorable "exclusion" decision.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s arguments respecting the cost/benefit analysis of applying the exclusionary rule on collateral attack also have no merit.  For all of the "costs" of applying the exclusionary rule on habeas <em>should already have been incurred</em> at the trial or on direct review if the state court had not misapplied federal constitutional principles.  As such, these "costs" were evaluated and deemed to be outweighed when the exclusionary rule was fashioned.  The only proper question on habeas is whether federal courts, acting under congressional directive to have the last say as to enforcement of federal constitutional principles, are to permit the States free enjoyment of the fruits of a conviction which by definition were only obtained through violations of the Constitution as interpreted in <em>Mapp.</em>  And as to the question whether any "educative" function is served by such habeas review, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#493">428 U. S. 493</a></span>, today\'s decision will certainly provide a lesson that, tragically for an individual\'s constitutional rights, will not be lost on state courts.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#530">428 U. S. 530</a></span>-533.</p>\n<p>Another line of analysis exposes the fallacy of treating today\'s holding as a constitutional decision.  Constitutionally, no barrier precludes a state defendant from immediately seeking a federal court\'s injunction against any state use of unconstitutionally seized evidence against him at trial.  However, equitable principles have operated to foreclose cutting short the normal <em>initial</em> adjudication of such constitutional defenses in the course of a criminal prosecution, <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U.

Moreover, considerations of comity, now statutorily codified as the exhaustion requirement of \xc2\xa7 2254, and not lack of power, dictate that federal habeas review be delayed pending the initial state court determination.  But delay only was the price,</p>\n<p>"else a rule of timing would become a rule circumscribing the power of the federal courts on habeas, in defiance of unmistakable congressional intent."</p>\n<p><em>Fay v.

Although the federal courts could have been the forum for the initial "opportunity for a full and fair hearing" of Fourth Amendment claims of state prisoners that the Court finds constitutionally sufficient, nonconstitutional concerns dictated temporary abstention; but having so abstained, federal courts are now ousted by this Court from ever determining the claims, since the courts to which they initially deferred are all that this Court deems necessary for protecting rights essential to preservation of the Fourth Amendment.

Rice,</em> 188 Neb. 728, 739, 199 N.W.2d 480, 488 (1972).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>For many of the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, I cannot agree that the writ of habeas corpus should be any less available to those convicted of state crimes where they allege Fourth Amendment violations than where other constitutional issues are presented to the federal court.  Under the amendments to the habeas corpus statute, which were adopted after <em>Fay v. Noia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html">372 U. S. 391</a></span> (1963), and represented an effort by Congress to lend a modicum of finality to state criminal judgments, I cannot distinguish between Fourth Amendment and other constitutional issues.</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that two confederates in crime, Smith and Jones, are tried separately for a state crime and convicted on the very same evidence, including evidence seized incident to their arrest allegedly made without probable cause.  Their constitutional claims are fully aired, rejected, and preserved on appeal.  Their convictions are affirmed by the State\'s highest court.  Smith, the first to be tried, does not petition for certiorari, or does so, but his petition is denied.  Jones, whose conviction was considerably later, is more successful.  His petition for certiorari is granted and his conviction reversed because this Court, without making any new rule of law, simply concludes that, on the undisputed facts, the arrests were made without probable cause and the challenged evidence was therefore seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The State must either retry Jones or release him, necessarily because he is deemed in custody in violation of the Constitution.  It turns out that, without the evidence illegally seized, the State has no case; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 428 U. S. 537</a></p><p> and Jones goes free.  Smith then files his petition for habeas corpus.  He makes no claim that he did not have a full and fair hearing in the state courts, but asserts that his Fourth Amendment claim had been erroneously decided, and that he is being held in violation of the Federal Constitution.  He cites this Court\'s decision in Jones\' case to satisfy any burden placed on him by \xc2\xa7 2254 to demonstrate that the state court was in error.  Unless the Court\'s reservation, in its present opinion, of those situations where the defendant has not had a full and fair hearing in the state courts is intended to encompass all those circumstances under which a state criminal judgment may be reexamined under \xc2\xa7 2254 -- in which event the opinion is essentially meaningless and the judgment erroneous -- Smith\'s petition would be dismissed, and he would spend his life in prison while his colleague is a free man.  I cannot believe that Congress intended this result.</p>\n<p>Under the present habeas corpus statute, neither Rice\'s nor Powell\'s application for habeas corpus should be dismissed on the grounds now stated by the Court.  I would affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals as being acceptable applications of the exclusionary rule applicable in state criminal trials by virtue of <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>I feel constrained to say, however, that I would join four or more other Justices in substantially limiting the reach of the exclusionary rule as presently administered under the Fourth Amendment in federal and state criminal trials.</p>\n<p>Whether I would have joined the Court\'s opinion in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, supra,</em> had I then been a Member of the Court, I do not know.  But, as time went on after coming to this bench, I became convinced that both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 428 U. S. 538</a></p><p> <em>Weeks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html">232 U. S. 383</a></span> (1914), and <em>Mapp v. Ohio</em> had overshot their mark insofar as they aimed to deter lawless action by law enforcement personnel, and that, in many of its applications, the exclusionary rule was not advancing that aim in the slightest, and that, in this respect, it was a senseless obstacle to arriving at the truth in many criminal trials.</p>\n<p>The rule has been much criticized, and suggestions have been made that it should be wholly abolished, but I would overrule neither <em>Weeks v. United States</em> nor <em>Mapp v. Ohio.</em>  I am nevertheless of the view that the rule should be substantially modified so as to prevent its application in those many circumstances where the evidence at issue was seized by an officer acting in the good faith belief that his conduct comported with existing law and having reasonable grounds for this belief.  These are recurring situations, and, recurringly, evidence is excluded without any realistic expectation that its exclusion will contribute in the slightest to the purposes of the rule, even though the trial will be seriously affected or the indictment dismissed.</p>\n<p>An officer sworn to uphold the law and to apprehend those who break it inevitably must make judgments regarding probable cause to arrest:  is there reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that a particular suspect has committed it?  Sometimes, the historical facts are disputed, or are otherwise in doubt.  In other situations, the facts may be clear, so far as they are known, yet the question of probable cause remains.  In still others, there are special worries about the reliability of second-hand information such as that coming from informants.  In any of these situations, which occur repeatedly, when the officer is convinced that he has probable cause to arrest he will very </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 428 U. S. 539</a></p><p> likely make the arrest.  Except in emergencies, it is probable that his colleagues or superiors will participate in the decision, and it may be that the officer will secure a warrant, although warrantless arrests on probable cause are not forbidden by the Constitution or by state law.  Making the arrest in such circumstances is precisely what the community expects the police officer to do.  Neither officers nor judges issuing arrest warrants need delay apprehension of the suspect until unquestioned proof against him has accumulated.  The officer may be shirking his duty if he does so.</p>\n<p>In most of these situations, it is hoped that the officer\'s judgment will be correct; but experience tells us that there will be those occasions where the trial or appellate court will disagree on the issue of probable cause, no matter how reasonable the grounds for arrest appeared to the officer and though reasonable men could easily differ on the question.  It also happens that, after the events at issue have occurred, the law may change, dramatically or ever so slightly, but, in any event, sufficiently to require the trial judge to hold that there was not probable cause to make the arrest and to seize the evidence offered by the prosecution.  It may also be, as in the <em>Powell</em> case now before us, that there is probable cause to make an arrest under a particular criminal statute, but, when evidence seized incident to the arrest is offered in support of still another criminal charge, the statute under which the arrest and seizure were made is declared unconstitutional, and the evidence ruled inadmissible under the exclusionary rule as presently administered.</p>\n<p>In these situations, and perhaps many others, excluding the evidence will not further the ends of the exclusionary rule in any appreciable way; for it is painfully apparent that, in each of them, the officer is acting as a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 428 U. S. 540</a></p><p> reasonable officer would, and should act in similar circumstances.  Excluding the evidence can in no way affect his future conduct unless it is to make him less willing to do his duty.  It is true that, in such cases, the courts have ultimately determined that, in their view, the officer was mistaken; but it is also true that, in making constitutional judgments under the general language used in some parts of our Constitution, including the Fourth Amendment, there is much room for disagreement among judges, each of whom is convinced that both he and his colleagues are reasonable men.  Surely when this Court divides five to four on issues of probable cause, it is not tenable to conclude that the officer was at fault or acted unreasonably in making the arrest.</p>\n<p>When law enforcement personnel have acted mistakenly, but in good faith and on reasonable grounds, and yet the evidence they have seized is later excluded, the exclusion can have no deterrent effect.  The officers, if they do their duty, will act in similar fashion in similar circumstances in the future; and the only consequence of the rule as presently administered is that unimpeachable and probative evidence is kept from the trier of fact, and the truthfinding function of proceedings is substantially impaired, or a trial totally aborted.  Admitting the evidence in such circumstances does not render judges participants in Fourth Amendment violations.  The violation, if there was one, has already occurred, and the evidence is at hand.  Furthermore, there has been only mistaken, but unintentional and faultless, conduct by enforcement officers.  Exclusion of the evidence does not cure the invasion of the defendant\'s rights, which he has already suffered.  Where an arrest has been made on probable cause, but the defendant is acquitted, under federal law, the defendant has no right to damages simply because his innocence has been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 428 U. S. 541</a></p><p> proved.</p>\n<p>"A policeman\'s lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he has probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does."</p>\n<p><em>Pierson v.

The officer is also excused from liability for "acting under a statute that he reasonably believed to be valid, but that was later held unconstitutional, on its face or as applied."  <em>Ibid.</em>  There is little doubt that, as far as civil liability is concerned, the rule is the same under federal law where the officer mistakenly but reasonably believes he has probable cause for an arrest.  In <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html">416 U. S. 232</a></span> (1974), the Court announced generally that officers of the executive branch of the government should be immune from liability where their action is reasonable "in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good faith belief."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#247">416 U.

The Court went on to say:</p>\n<p>"Public officials, whether governors, mayors or police, legislators or judges, who fail to make decisions when they are needed or who do not act to implement decisions when they are made do not fully and faithfully perform the duties of their offices.  Implicit in the idea that officials have some immunity -- absolute or qualified -- for their acts is a recognition that they may err.  The concept of immunity assumes this, and goes on to assume that it is better to risk some error and possible injury from such error than not to decide or act at all."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#241">416 U.

It is often contraband and stolen property to which he is not entitled in any event.  He has been charged with crime, and is seeking to have probative evidence against him excluded, although often it is the instrumentality of the crime.  There is very little equity in the defendant\'s side in these circumstances.  The exclusionary rule, a judicial construct, seriously shortchanges the public interest as presently applied.  I would modify it accordingly.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
