S. 654</a></p><p> was an acceptance of the 21 in payment <em>pro tanto</em> of the claim; that the contract for the payment in wagons was unfulfilled as to the 4 wagons not delivered, and that the price for which the 19 wagons were sold, and the selling value of the 2 not sold, have no bearing on the case under the first count, unless there be a surplus of the proceeds of sale, to be refunded to the appellee, under the contract.</p>\n<p>As to the second count, it sets forth a good cause of action.  That count does not involve on its face any question as to the contract evidenced by the receipt embodied in the first count.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the Supreme Court is reversed with direction to it to reverse the judgment of the district court and to take or direct such further proceedings in the suit as may be according to law and in conformity with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
