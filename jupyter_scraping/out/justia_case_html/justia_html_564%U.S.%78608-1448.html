Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium.  And \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic principles of freedom of speech \xe2\x80\xa6 do not vary\xe2\x80\x9d with a new and different communication medium.  <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/index.html">343 U. S. 495</a>, 503.  The most basic principle\xe2\x80\x94that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/564/index.html">535 U. S. 564</a>, 573\xe2\x80\x94is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words.  But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike the New York law upheld in <em>Ginsberg</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/index.html">390 U. S. 629</a>, California\xe2\x80\x99s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children.  Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.  That is unprecedented and mistaken.  This country has no tradition of specially restricting children\xe2\x80\x99s access to depictions of violence.  And California\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9cinteractive\xe2\x80\x9d video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, <em>i.e., </em>it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em> v. <em>St. Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/377/index.html">505 U. S. 377</a>, 395.  California cannot meet that standard.  Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes<em> </em>minors to act<em> </em>aggressively.  Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.  Since California has declined to restrict those other media, <em>e.g.,</em> Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.  California also cannot show that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\xe2\x80\x99s access to violent videos.  The video-game industry\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent.  Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so.  The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.

Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71746\xe2\x80\x931746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent video games\xe2\x80\x9d to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled \xe2\x80\x9c18.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act covers games \xe2\x80\x9cin which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cpatently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ccauses the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A).  Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000.  \xc2\xa71746.3.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  <em>Video Software Dealers Assn.</em> v. <em>Schwarzenegger</em>, No. C\xe2\x80\x9305\xe2\x80\x9304188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Video Software Dealers Assn.</em> v. <em>Schwarzenegger</em>, 556 F.\xc2\xa03d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection.  The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try.  \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction.  What is one man\xe2\x80\x99s amusement, teaches another\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Winters</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/index.html"></a><a href="/us/333/507/index.html">333 U. S. 507</a>, 510 (1948).  Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas\xe2\x80\x94and even social messages\xe2\x80\x94through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the virtual world).  That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.  Under our Constitution, \xe2\x80\x9cesthetic and moral judgments about art and literature \xe2\x80\xa6 are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a>, 818 (2000).  And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s command, do not vary\xe2\x80\x9d when a new and different medium for communication appears.  <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/index.html">343 U. S. 495</a>, 503 (1952).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most basic of those principles is this: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general matter, \xe2\x80\xa6 government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/564/index.html">535 U. S. 564</a>, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  There are of course exceptions.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98From 1791 to the present,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 the First Amendment has \xe2\x80\x98permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,\xe2\x80\x99 and has never \xe2\x80\x98include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em> v. <em>St. Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/377/index.html">505 U. S. 377</a>, 382\xe2\x80\x93383 (1992)).  These limited areas\xe2\x80\x94such as obscenity, <em>Roth</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/index.html">354 U. S. 476</a>, 483 (1957), incitement, <em>Brandenburg</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/444/index.html">395 U. S. 444</a>, 447\xe2\x80\x93449 (1969) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and fighting words, <em>Chaplinsky</em> v. <em>New Hampshire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/index.html">315 U. S. 568</a>,\n572 (1942)\xe2\x80\x94represent \xe2\x80\x9cwell-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 571\xe2\x80\x93572.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last Term, in <em>Stevens</em>, we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated.  <em>Stevens </em>concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa748 (amended 2010).  The statute covered depictions \xe2\x80\x9cin which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed\xe2\x80\x9d if that harm to the animal was illegal where the \xe2\x80\x9cthe creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa748(c)(1).  A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see <em>Miller</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/index.html">413 U. S. 15</a>, 24 (1973), exempted depictions with \xe2\x80\x9cserious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa748(b).  We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech.  There was no American tradition of forbidding the <em>depiction of</em> animal cruelty\xe2\x80\x94though States have long had laws against <em>committing </em>it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argued in <em>Stevens</em> that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a \xe2\x80\x9csimple balancing test\xe2\x80\x9d that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test.  <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).<em> </em>We emphatically rejected that \xe2\x80\x9cstartling and dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d proposition.  <em>Ibid.  </em>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).  But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment [of] the American people,\xe2\x80\x9d embodied in the First Amendment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 7).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That holding controls this case.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As in <em>Stevens</em>, California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter.  That does not suffice.  Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of \xe2\x80\x9csexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miller</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 24.  See also <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U. S. 15</a>, 20 (1971); <em>Roth</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 487, and n.\xc2\xa020.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Stevens</em> was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity.  In <em>Winters</em>, we considered a New York criminal statute \xe2\x80\x9cforbid[ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,\xe2\x80\x9d 333 U. S., at 514.  The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing that we rejected in <em>Stevens</em>.  Our opinion in <em>Winters</em>, which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517\xe2\x80\x93519,<em> </em>made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated.  The speech reached by the statute contained \xe2\x80\x9cno indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 519.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California\xe2\x80\x99s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in <em>Ginsberg</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/index.html">390 U. S. 629</a> (1968).  That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of <em>sexual</em> material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We held that the legislature could\n\xe2\x80\x9cadjus[t] the definition of obscenity \xe2\x80\x98to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\xa6 minors.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 638 (quoting <em>Mishkin</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/502/index.html">383 U. S. 502</a>, 509 (1966)).  And because \xe2\x80\x9cobscenity is not protected expression,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children \xe2\x80\x9cwas not irrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  390 U. S., at 641.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Act is something else entirely.  It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children.  California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works <em>to adults</em>\xe2\x80\x94and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from the argument rejected in <em>Stevens</em>.  Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is unprecedented and mistaken.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erznoznik</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/index.html">422 U. S. 205</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1975) (citation omitted).  No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, <em>Ginsberg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641; <em>Prince</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/index.html">321 U. S. 158</a>, 165 (1944), but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed.  \xe2\x80\x9cSpeech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erznoznik</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 213\xe2\x80\x93214.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children\xe2\x80\x99s access to depictions of violence, but there is none.  Certainly the <em>books</em> we give children to read\xe2\x80\x94or read to them when they are younger\xe2\x80\x94contain no shortage of gore.  Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed.

Many in the late 1940\xe2\x80\x99s and early 1950\xe2\x80\x99s blamed comic books for fostering a \xe2\x80\x9cpreoccupation with violence and horror\xe2\x80\x9d among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate.  See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 489, 490 (1955).  But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed.

The latter feature is nothing new: Since\nat least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island<em> </em>in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to.  Cf. <em>Interactive Digital Software Assn.</em> v. <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis County,</em> 329 F.\xc2\xa03d 954, 957\xe2\x80\x93958 (CA8 2003).  As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind.  As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he better it is, the more interactive.  Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader\xe2\x80\x99s own.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>American Amusement Machine Assn.</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, 244 F.\xc2\xa03d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito has done considerable independent re-search to identify, see <em>post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, nn. 13\xe2\x80\x9318, video games in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe violence is astounding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 14.  \xe2\x80\x9cVictims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  Justice Alito </em>recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us\xe2\x80\x94but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression.  And the same is true of Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s description, <em>post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x99 [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.\xe2\x80\x9d  To what end does he relate this?  Does it somehow increase the \xe2\x80\x9caggressiveness\xe2\x80\x9d that California wishes to suppress?  Who knows?  But it does arouse the reader\xe2\x80\x99s ire, and the reader\xe2\x80\x99s desire to put an end to this horrible message.  Thus, ironically, Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the <em>ideas </em>expressed by speech\xe2\x80\x94whether it be violence, or gore, or racism\xe2\x80\x94and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.  <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em>, 505 U.

S., at 822\xe2\x80\x93823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see <em>R. A. V.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 395.  That is a demanding standard.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Playboy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 818.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California cannot meet that standard.  At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors.  Rather, relying upon our decision in <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a> (1994), the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies.  But reliance on <em>Turner Broadcasting</em> is misplaced.  That decision applied <em>intermediate scrutiny</em> to a content-neutral regulation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 661\xe2\x80\x93662.  California\xe2\x80\x99s burden is much higher, and because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see <em>Playboy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 816\xe2\x80\x93817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence is not compelling.  California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children.  These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games <em>cause </em>minors to <em>act </em>aggressively (which would at least be a beginning).  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Video Software Dealers Assn.</em> 556 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 964.  They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children\xe2\x80\x99s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children\xe2\x80\x99s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.  In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect sizes\xe2\x80\x9d of children\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to violent video games are \xe2\x80\x9cabout the same\xe2\x80\x9d as that produced by their exposure to violence on television.  App. 1263.  And he admits that the <em>same</em> effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, <em>id.,</em> at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated \xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x9d (appropriate for all ages), <em>id.,</em> at 1270, or even when they \xe2\x80\x9cvie[w] a picture of a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1315\xe2\x80\x931316.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the distribution of pictures of guns.  The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it.  Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.  See <em>City of Ladue</em> v. <em>Gilleo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/43/index.html">512 U. S. 43</a>, 51 (1994); <em>Florida Star</em> v. <em>B.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0F.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/524/index.html">491 U. S. 524</a>, 540 (1989).  Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment\xe2\x80\x94at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers\xe2\x80\x94and has given no persuasive reason why.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect\xe2\x80\x94and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence.  The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it\xe2\x80\x99s OK.  And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child\xe2\x80\x99s or putative parent\xe2\x80\x99s, aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, or uncle\xe2\x80\x99s say-so suffices.  That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate.  At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing<em> </em>third parties for conveying protected speech to children <em>just in case</em> their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority.  Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that \xe2\x80\x9conly in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erznoznik</em>, 422 U. S., at 212\xe2\x80\x93213.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\xe2\x80\x99s access to violent video games but cannot do so.  The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games.  The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only\xe2\x80\x9418 and older).  App. 86.  The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell \xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x9d rated games to minors only with parental consent.  <em>Id.,</em> at 47.  In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, \xe2\x80\x9cthe video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9c(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re-stricting children\xe2\x80\x99s access to mature-rated products at retail.\xe2\x80\x9d  FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http://\nwww.ftc.gov\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0os/\xc2\xa02009\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa012/\xc2\xa0P994511violententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (FTC Report).  This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home.  Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents\xe2\x80\x99 control can hardly be a compelling state interest.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And finally, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive.  Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who <em>care</em> whether they purchase violent video games.  While some of the legislation\xe2\x80\x99s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents <em>ought </em>to want.  This is not the narrow tailoring to \xe2\x80\x9cassisting parents\xe2\x80\x9d that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors.  While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them\xe2\x80\x94concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight.  We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development.  Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chaplinsky</em>, 315 U. S., at 571\xe2\x80\x93572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not).  Even where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children.  Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive.  See <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hialeah</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/520/index.html">508 U. S. 520</a>, 546 (1993).  As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto.  And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime.  And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other.  Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Alito distinguishes <em>Stevens</em> on several grounds that seem to us ill founded.  He suggests, <em>post</em>, at 10 (opinion concurring in judgment), that <em>Stevens </em>did not apply strict scrutiny.  If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an <em>a fortiori </em>case.  He says, <em>post</em>, at 9, 10, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the \xe2\x80\x9ccreation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpossession\xe2\x80\x9d of violent depictions.  That distinction appears nowhere in <em>Stevens</em> itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books\xe2\x80\x94though not the writing of them.  Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference.  And finally, Justice Alito points out, <em>post</em>, at 10, that <em>Stevens </em>\xe2\x80\x9cleft open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute\xe2\x80\x9d would be constitutional.  True, but entirely irrelevant.  <em>Stevens </em>said, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19), that the \xe2\x80\x9ccrush-video\xe2\x80\x9d statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed.  There is no contention that any of the virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are criminally liable. </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The statute in <em>Ginsberg</em> restricted the sale of certain depictions of \xe2\x80\x9cnudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d that were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[h]armful to minors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  A depiction was harmful to minors if it:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interests of minors, and </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  390 U.

He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none.  Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say.  This is true enough.  And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to <em>enforce</em> parental prohibitions\xe2\x80\x94to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend.  But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or saying anything <em>without their parents\xe2\x80\x99 prior consent</em>.  The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents\xe2\x80\x99 prior written consent\xe2\x80\x94even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors.  And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents\xe2\x80\x99 prior consent.  Our point is not, as Justice Thomas believes, <em>post</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa02, merely that such laws are \xe2\x80\x9cundesirable.\xe2\x80\x9d  They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people.  Such laws do not enforce <em>parental</em> authority over children\xe2\x80\x99s speech and religion; they impose <em>governmental</em> authority, subject only to a parental veto.  In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child\xe2\x80\x99s speech and religion (Justice Thomas cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional.  This argument is not, as Justice Thomas asserts, \xe2\x80\x9ccircular,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our <em>ipse dixit</em>, that renders them invalid. </p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Alito accuses us of pronouncing that playing violent video games \xe2\x80\x9cis not different in \xe2\x80\x98kind\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from reading violent literature.  <em>Post</em>, at 2.  Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection.

Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution.  We should make every effort to understand the new technology.  We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time.  We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar.  And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology.  The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games\xe2\x80\x94federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents\xe2\x80\x94are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313, 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down scores of innocent victims is not different in \xe2\x80\x9ckind\xe2\x80\x9d from reading a description of violence in a work of literature. See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is sure of this; I am not.  There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the narrower ground that the law\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent video game,\xe2\x80\x9d see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009), is impermissibly vague.  See Brief for Respondents 23\xe2\x80\x9361.  Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Due process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.  <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html">408 U.

But the California Legislature departed from the <em>Ginsberg</em> model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law at issue in <em>Ginsberg</em> prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed \xe2\x80\x9charmful to minors,\xe2\x80\x9d and the law defined \xe2\x80\x9charmful to minors\xe2\x80\x9d simply by adding the words \xe2\x80\x9cfor minors\xe2\x80\x9d to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court\xe2\x80\x99s leading obscenity decisions, see <em>Roth</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/index.html">354 U.

S. 413</a> (1966).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of <em>Ginsberg</em>, the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in <em>Miller</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/index.html">413 U. S. 15</a> (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in <em>Roth</em> and <em>Memoirs</em>.  The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Miller</em>, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh-old limitation that restricts the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope to specifically described \xe2\x80\x9chard core\xe2\x80\x9d materials.  See 413 U. S.,\nat 23\xe2\x80\x9325, 27.  Materials that fall within this \xe2\x80\x9chard core\xe2\x80\x9d category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:</p>\n<p>\n\n(1) an \xe2\x80\x9caverage person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find \xe2\x80\xa6 the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\xe2\x80\x9d;</p>\n<p>\n\n(2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n(3) \xe2\x80\x9cthe work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1).  Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first important difference between the <em>Ginsberg</em> law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements.  As noted, the <em>Ginsberg</em> law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in <em>Miller, </em>requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to specifically defined \xe2\x80\x9chard core\xe2\x80\x9d depictions.  See 413 U. S., at 23\xe2\x80\x9325, 27.  The <em>Miller </em>Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only \xe2\x80\x9c[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmasturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 25.  The <em>Miller</em> Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe are satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 27; see also <em>Reno</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 873 (observing that <em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s threshold limitation \xe2\x80\x9creduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term \xe2\x80\x98patently offensive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in <em>Miller</em>. At least when <em>Miller</em> was decided, depictions of \xe2\x80\x9chard core\xe2\x80\x9d sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment.  But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law.  It provides that a video game cannot qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of<em> </em>a human being<em>.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors.  The California law\xe2\x80\x99s threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in <em>Miller</em> if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of this feature of the California law\xe2\x80\x99s threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task.  In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups).  Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A)(ii).  Another element points in the same direction, asking whether \xe2\x80\x9c[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d would find that it \xe2\x80\x9cappeals to a <em>deviant</em> or <em>morbid</em> interest of minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmorbid\xe2\x80\x9d are not defined in\nthe statute, and California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through \xe2\x80\xa6 a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms\xe2\x80\x9d).  I therefore assume that \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmorbid\xe2\x80\x9d carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech.  The adjective \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily means \xe2\x80\x9cdeviating \xe2\x80\xa6 from some accepted norm,\xe2\x80\x9d and the term \xe2\x80\x9cmorbid\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cof, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 618, 1469.  A \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant or morbid interest\xe2\x80\x9d in\nviolence, therefore, appears to be an interest that de-\nviates from what is regarded\xe2\x80\x94presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard\xe2\x80\x94as normal and healthy.  Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is enough to qualify the game as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent.\xe2\x80\x9d  And because the <em>Miller</em> test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game law would not present vagueness problems.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment.  By the time of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s landmark obscenity cases in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, obscenity had long been prohibited, see <em>Roth</em>, 354 U. S., at 484\xe2\x80\x93485, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no similar history regarding expression related to violence.  As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children\xe2\x80\x99s stories sometimes depict very violent scenes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children\xe2\x80\x99s literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmorbid\xe2\x80\x9d impulses.  See Edwards &amp; Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the <em>Miller</em> test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to lump all minors together.  The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9cminors\xe2\x80\x9d would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors\xe2\x80\x94that is, those just short of 18.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  However, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not within our power to construe and narrow state laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grayned</em>, 408 U. S., at 110.  We can only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extrapolate [their] allowable meaning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State.  <em>Ibid</em>.

And I would go no further.  I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.

S. ___ (2010), \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  First, the statute in <em>Stevens</em> differed sharply from the statute at issue here.  <em>Stevens</em> struck down a law that broadly prohibited <em>any person</em> from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain.  The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games <em>to minors</em>.  The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18.  The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults.  And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>Stevens </em>does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy<em> </em>strict scrutiny.  The portion of <em>Stevens</em> on which the Court relies rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of <em>any</em> First Amendment protection.  559 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5).  Going well beyond <em>Steven</em>s, the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in <em>Ginsberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/index.html"></a><a href="/us/390/629/index.html">390 U. S. 629</a>, our most closely related precedent.  As a result of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what <em>Ginsberg</em> described as \xe2\x80\x9cgirlie magazines,\xe2\x80\x9d but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, <em>Stevens</em> expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment.  See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  In this case, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors\xe2\x80\x99 access to violent video games is allowed\xe2\x80\x94at least without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion distorts the effect of the California law.  I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no \xe2\x80\x9cfree-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, but the California law does not exercise such a power.  If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative.  Instead, the California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in <em>Ginsberg</em>.  Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citing the video-game industry\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not \xe2\x80\x9cmeet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\xe2\x80\x99s access to violent video games but cannot do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7\xe2\x80\x9310, a threat that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating.  Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]\xe2\x80\x94or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished.  Nor does the Court note, as Justice Breyer points out, see <em>post</em>, at 11 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children\xe2\x80\x99s use of computers and gaming devices.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before.  Any assessment of the experience of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end.  These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  It is also forecast that video games will soon provide sensory feedback.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character on the screen.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Some <em>amici</em> who support respondents foresee the day when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtual-reality shoot-\xe2\x80\x98em-ups\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d will allow children to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a victim.  Brief for Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Persons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create.  Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people.  A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game.  In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world.  While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character in the game to perform.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat\xe2\x80\x94either to hit a ball or smash a skull\xe2\x80\x94could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some of these games, the violence is astounding.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws.  Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces.  They cry out in agony and beg for mercy.  Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.  Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown.  In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit.  There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The objective of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  There is a game in which players engage in \xe2\x80\x9cethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the characteristics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is untroubled by this possibility.  According to the Court, the \xe2\x80\x9cinteractive\xe2\x80\x9d nature of video games is \xe2\x80\x9cnothing new\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9call literature is interactive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)\xe2\x80\x94a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents\xe2\x80\x94tells us that video games are \xe2\x80\x9cfar more concretely interactive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for IGDA et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.  And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is certainly true, as the Court notes, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[l]it-erature, when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites\nhim to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader\xe2\x80\x99s own.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (quoting <em>American Amusement Machine Assn.</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, 244 F.\xc2\xa03d 572, 577 (CA7 2001)).  But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game.  To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolni-\nkov kills the old pawn broker with an axe.  See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed. 1950).  Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands.  For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie.  And if this is so, then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different.  The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires.  I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem.  If differently framed statutes are enacted by the States or by the Federal Government, we can consider the constitutionality of those laws when cases challenging them are presented\nto us.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower court.  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/index.html">439 U.

In the Court of Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is unconstitutional, 556 F.\xc2\xa03d 950, 954, n.\xc2\xa05 (CA9 2009), and therefore only the requirements set out in text are now before us.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was convicted in <em>Ginsberg</em> was framed with similar specificity.

The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children.  It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d to include a right to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\xe2\x80\x99 parents.  Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  The founding generation would not have considered \nit an abridgment of \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors\xe2\x80\x99 parents.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights.  A complete understanding of the founding generation\xe2\x80\x99s views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Mintz, Huck\xe2\x80\x99s Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p.\xc2\xa07 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald).  The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure.  Mintz 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Part of the father\xe2\x80\x99s absolute power was the right and duty \xe2\x80\x9cto fill his children\xe2\x80\x99s minds with knowledge and \xe2\x80\xa6 make them apply their knowledge in right action.\xe2\x80\x9d  E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed. 1966) (herein-after Morgan).  Puritans thought children were \xe2\x80\x9cinnately sinful and that parents\xe2\x80\x99 primary task was to suppress their children\xe2\x80\x99s natural depravity.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Mintz &amp; S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz &amp; Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (\xe2\x80\x9cChildren should not be left to themselves \xe2\x80\xa6 to do as they please; \xe2\x80\xa6 not being fit to govern themselves\xe2\x80\x9d); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699).  Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read \xe2\x80\x9cvain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfond and amorous Romances, \xe2\x80\xa6 fabulous Histories of Giants, the bom-\nbast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  The History of Genesis, pp. vi\xe2\x80\x93vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time.  In the Massachusetts Colony, for \nexample, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents\xe2\x80\x99 consent.  2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 <em>id.,</em> at 237, 275 (1914); 5 <em>id.,</em> at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146.

Farrand ed. 1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n.\xc2\xa014 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600\xe2\x80\x99s).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes towards children changed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775\xe2\x80\x931850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier).  Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development.  But the same overarching principles remained.  Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children.  They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read.  And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental author-\nity and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood.  See Reinier 2\xe2\x80\x935; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in the House 59\xe2\x80\x9360 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert).  Locke taught that children\xe2\x80\x99s minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed.  Parents had only themselves to blame if, \xe2\x80\x9cby hu-mouring and cockering\xe2\x80\x9d their children, they \xe2\x80\x9cpoison\xe2\x80\x99d \nthe fountain\xe2\x80\x9d and later \xe2\x80\x9ctaste[d] the bitter waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (C. Eliot ed. 1910).  All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and \xe2\x80\x9cthose about children.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 29.  Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it.  Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child\xe2\x80\x99s development.  Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by \xe2\x80\x9ca tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These writings received considerable attention in America.  Locke\xe2\x80\x99s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776.  Lundberg &amp; May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg).  And Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract.  Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285.  In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing.  See Mintz &amp; Kellogg 45.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Locke\xe2\x80\x99s and Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s writings fostered a new conception of childhood.  Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood.  See Mintz &amp; Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg).  Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed. 1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster\xe2\x80\x99s First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967).  Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Norton, Liberty\xe2\x80\x99s Daughters 101 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n early youth, \xe2\x80\xa6 every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression\xe2\x80\x9d); J. Abbott, The Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the susceptibility of youth\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Children lacked reason and decisionmaking ability.  They \xe2\x80\x9chave not Judgment or Will of their own,\xe2\x80\x9d John Adams noted.  Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed. 1979); see also Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton ed. 1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that children do not vote because they \xe2\x80\x9cwant prudence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave no will of their own\xe2\x80\x9d).  Children\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cutter incapacity\xe2\x80\x9d rendered them \xe2\x80\x9calmost wholly at the mercy of their Parents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children.  \xe2\x80\x9cYouth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe vices of young people are generally learned from each other\xe2\x80\x9d); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]hildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Books therefore advised parents \xe2\x80\x9cnot to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  L. Child, The Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149\xe2\x80\x93150 (1988) (noting that it was \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development.  See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8.  Managing the young mind was considered \xe2\x80\x9cinfinitely important.\xe2\x80\x9d  Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod).  In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as \xe2\x80\x9ca rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rudolph 54.  He advocated sheltering children from \xe2\x80\x9cevery low-bred, drunken, immoral character\xe2\x80\x9d and keeping their minds \xe2\x80\x9cuntainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 63; see also Rush, in <em>id.,</em> at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he most useful citizens have been formed from those youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age\xe2\x80\x9d); Burgh 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he souls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Revolution only amplified these concerns.  The Re-public would require virtuous citizens, which necessi-\ntated proper training from childhood.  See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed. 2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv\xe2\x80\x93xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us\xe2\x80\x9d).  Children were \xe2\x80\x9cthe pivot of the moral world,\xe2\x80\x9d and their proper development was \xe2\x80\x9ca subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at xvi.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children\xe2\x80\x99s growth.  Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root.  See Calvert 58\xe2\x80\x9359; MacLeod 72; Mintz &amp; Kellogg 23.  They were responsible for instilling \xe2\x80\x9cmoral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare\na child for the outside world.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mintz &amp; Kellogg 58; see also Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion) (\xe2\x80\x9cLet [children\xe2\x80\x99s] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 \n(N. Hiner &amp; J. Hawes eds. 1985).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s approach to raising children.  He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in <em>id.,</em> at 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on\xe2\x80\x9d).  Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write \xe2\x80\x9cby every post\xe2\x80\x9d and instructed her, \xe2\x80\x9cInform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in <em>id.,</em> at 44.  He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr\xe2\x80\x99s father died.  See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405\xe2\x80\x93408 (J. Boyd ed. 1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing \xe2\x80\x9cin what manner you employ every hour in the day\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and stressing continued subjection to the parental will.\xe2\x80\x9d  Norton 96.  Two parenting books published in the 1830\xe2\x80\x99s gave prototypical advice.  In The Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Book, Lydia Child advised that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always <em>must</em> be done.\xe2\x80\x9d  Child 26.  John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abbott 18.  Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfoolish and unreasonable wishes\xe2\x80\x9d would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood.  <em>Id.,</em> at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concept of total parental control over children\xe2\x80\x99s lives extended into the schools.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe government both of families and schools should be absolute,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Noah Webster.  Rudolph 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as <em>absolute </em>as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 16.  Through the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis</em>, teachers assumed the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sacred dut[y] of parents \xe2\x80\xa6 to train up and qualify their children\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and exercised the same authority \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morse</em> v. <em>Frederick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/393/index.html">551 U.

Mintz &amp; Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977).  Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience.  See Adams, \xe2\x80\x9cPictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame\xe2\x80\x9d: The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156.  One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls.  See J.

See MacLeod 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 42\xe2\x80\x9348; see also <em>id.,</em> at 42 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more excit-\ning fare\xe2\x80\x9d); Francis, American Children\xe2\x80\x99s Literature, \n1646\xe2\x80\x931880, in American Childhood 208\xe2\x80\x93209 (J.

John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children\xe2\x80\x99s literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished.  Reinier 12<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Parents had total authority over what their children read.  See A.

According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and education their children, and therefore had \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d over their children.  1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U.

Chancellor James Kent agreed.  2 Commentaries on American Law *189\xe2\x80\x93*207.  The law entitled parents to \xe2\x80\x9cthe custody of their [children],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of th[e] [children\xe2\x80\x99s] labor and services,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cright to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at *193, *203.  Children, in turn, were charged with \xe2\x80\x9cobedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at *207.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child\xe2\x80\x99s labor and services until the child reached majority.  In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Day</em> v. <em>Everett,</em> 7 Mass. 145, 147; see also <em>Benson</em> v. <em>Remington</em>, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be contested.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gale</em> v. <em>Parrot</em>, 1 N.\xc2\xa0H. 28, 29 (1817).  And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kirkpatrick</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, 2 Brev. 276 (S.\xc2\xa0C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Tevis</em>, 4 Litt. 25 (Ky. App. 1823).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent.  Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages.  See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21\xe2\x80\x9324.  And after the war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents\xe2\x80\x99 request.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Anderson</em>, 24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Callan</em>, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent.  For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21.  See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell &amp; H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82\xe2\x80\x9383 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed. 1981).  In general, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could \xe2\x80\xa6 no[t] intellectually understand its significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grossberg 105.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason.  Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14.  See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159.  Nor could they swear loyalty to a State.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 9 Pa. Stats. at Large 111 (1903 ed.).  Early federal laws granting aliens the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children.  The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty.  See MacDonald 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child\xe2\x80\x99s mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained.  Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before.  See Mintz 72 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy weakening earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability\xe2\x80\x9d).  Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children\xe2\x80\x99s reading material was carefully supervised.  Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d to include an unqualified right to speak to minors.  Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents.  As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech\xe2\x80\x94for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cabridg[e] the freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d within the original meaning of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have recently noted that this Court does not have \xe2\x80\x9cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  But we also recognized that there may be \xe2\x80\x9csome categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provision does not always comport with modern sensibilities.  See <em>Morse</em>, 551 U. S., at 419 (Thomas, J., concurring) (treating students \xe2\x80\x9cas though it were still the 19th century would find little support today\xe2\x80\x9d).  It may also be inconsistent with precedent.  See <em>McDonald</em>, 561 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 48\xe2\x80\x93\n52) (rejecting the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning \nof the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This, however, is not such a case.  Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today.  For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor\xe2\x80\x99s parent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7787.03 (2010).  Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent.  Cf. <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 558 (Appendix D to opinion of Court) (2005).  Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent.  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7505(a).  And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, <em>id.,</em> at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not.  State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.  See <em>Roper</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 581\xe2\x80\x93585 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of Court).  In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, \xc2\xa7326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate Code Ann. \xc2\xa76220 (West 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d is also consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Erznoznik</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/index.html">422 U. S. 205</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see <em>id.,</em> at 213\xe2\x80\x93214; <em>Tinker</em> v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/index.html">393 U. S. 503</a>, 511 (1969).  But this Court has never held, until today, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\xe2\x80\x99 parents.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is well settled that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than on those available to adults.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erznoznik</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 212; cf. <em>post</em>, at 3 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9chistorically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parham</em> v. <em>J.\xc2\xa0R.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/584/index.html">442 U.

Critically, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors from playing such games.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 10 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment);<em> post</em>, at 10 (Breyer, J., dissenting).<em> </em>The law also does not restrict a \xe2\x80\x9cminor\xe2\x80\x99s parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian\xe2\x80\x9d from selling or renting him a violent video game.  \xc2\xa71746.1(c).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, associations of companies in the video game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to California\xe2\x80\x99s law, claiming that on its face the law violates the free speech rights of their members.  The Court holds that video games are speech for purposes of the First Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitutional.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 11\xe2\x80\x9317.<em> </em>I disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under any of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail.  The video game associations cannot show \xe2\x80\x9cthat no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthat \nthe statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\xe2\x80\x9d or that \n\xe2\x80\x9ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment.  All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor\xe2\x80\x99s parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian.  Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent\xe2\x80\x99s or guardian\xe2\x80\x99s help.  In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor\xe2\x80\x99s parent or guardian.  Because such speech does not fall within \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d as originally understood, California\xe2\x80\x99s law does not ordinarily implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe freedom of speech,\xe2\x80\x9d as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors\xe2\x80\x99 parents or guardians.

Rep-\nresentatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement.

S. __, __  (2010) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted)<em>.</em>  Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech.  See<em> Broadrick</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/index.html">413 U. S. 601</a>, 614\xe2\x80\x93615 (1973).  Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry\xe2\x80\x99s own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act\xe2\x80\x99s criteria.  That area lies at the heart of the statute.  I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small.  And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvagueness\xe2\x80\x9d precedents and\na strict form of First Amendment scrutiny.  In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of \xe2\x80\x9cdepictions of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, but rather the category of \xe2\x80\x9cprotection of children.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has held that the \xe2\x80\x9cpower of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Prince</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/index.html">321 U.

And the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98regulatio[n] of communication addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/index.html">390 U.

No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, <em>automatically</em> fall outside the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child pornography.  We properly speak of <em>categories </em>of expression that lack protection when, like \xe2\x80\x9cchild pornography,\xe2\x80\x9d the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it.  But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a \xe2\x80\x9cnew category of unprotected speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Schenck</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/249/47/index.html">249 U. S. 47</a>, 52 (1919); <em>Holder</em> v. <em>Humanitarian Law Project</em>, 561 U. S. __ (2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in <em>Stevens, </em>after rejecting the claim that <em>all </em>de-pictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the\nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid.  Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, California\xe2\x80\x99s statute provides \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice of what is prohibited,\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently it is not impermissibly vague.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U.

S. 463</a> (1966)).  The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was suf-\nficiently clear.  390 U. S., at 643\xe2\x80\x93645.  No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection.  See <em>id.</em>, at 648\xe2\x80\x93650 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); <em>id.</em>, at 650\xe2\x80\x93671 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 671\xe2\x80\x93675 (Fortas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Comparing the language of California\xe2\x80\x99s statute (set forth <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932) with the language of New York\xe2\x80\x99s statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference.  Why are the words \xe2\x80\x9ckill,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmaim,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdismember\xe2\x80\x9d any more difficult to understand than the word \xe2\x80\x9cnudity?\xe2\x80\x9d  Justice Alito objects that these words do \xe2\x80\x9cnot perform the narrowing function\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes can only cover \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hard core\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d depictions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment).  But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to <em>Ginsberg</em>, which dealt with \xe2\x80\x9cnudity,\xe2\x80\x9d a category no more \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d than killing and maiming.  And in any event, <em>narrowness</em> and <em>vagueness</em> do not necessarily have anything to do with one another.  All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms \xe2\x80\x9ckill,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmaim,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdismember\xe2\x80\x9d give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remainder of California\xe2\x80\x99s definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in <em>Miller </em>v.<em> California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/index.html">413 U. S. 15</a> (1973), in permitting a <em>total ban </em>on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with <em>criminal </em>penalties).  The California law\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity standards\xe2\x80\x9d adheres to <em>Miller</em>, and in <em>Fort Wayne Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Indiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/46/index.html">489 U. S. 46</a>, 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (1989)<em>, </em>this Court specifically upheld the use of <em>Miller\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>language against charges of vagueness.  California only departed from the <em>Miller</em> formulation in two significant respects: It substituted the word \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d for the words \xe2\x80\x9cprurient\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshameful,\xe2\x80\x9d and it three times added the words \xe2\x80\x9cfor minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9cdeviant\xe2\x80\x9d differs from \xe2\x80\x9cprurient\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshameful,\xe2\x80\x9d but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute.  And the addition of \xe2\x80\x9cfor minors\xe2\x80\x9d to a version of the <em>Miller</em> standard was approved in <em>Ginsberg</em>, 390 U. S., at 643, even though the New York law \xe2\x80\x9cdr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8 (opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the <em>Miller</em> standard and the law upheld in <em>Ginsberg</em> lack perfect clarity.  But that fact reflects the dif-\nficulty of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate.  As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it when I see it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jacobellis</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/184/index.html">378 U. S. 184</a>, 197 (1964) (concurring opinion).  And Justice Douglas dissented from <em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard, which he thought was still too vague.  413 U. S., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity standards\xe2\x80\x9d tests used in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Ginsberg</em>.  They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation.  And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective.  Cf. <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 304 (the Constitution does not always require \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98perfect clarity and precise guidance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d even when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expressive activity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is involved).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What, then, is the difference between <em>Ginsberg</em> and <em>Miller</em> on the one hand and the California law on the other?  It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California\xe2\x80\x99s statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head.  (Foot-\nage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.)  See also <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  As in <em>Miller</em> and <em>Ginsberg</em>, the California law clearly <em>protects</em> even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  \xc2\xa71746(d)(1)(A)(iii).  And it is easier here than in <em>Miller\n</em>or <em>Ginsberg</em> to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute\xe2\x80\x99s border.  That is because here the industry it-\nself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who \xe2\x80\x9ctypically have experience with children\xe2\x80\x9d assess what games are inappropriate for minors.  See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http://www.esrb.org/ratings/&amp;ratings_ process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, of course, one obvious difference: The <em>Ginsberg </em>statute concerned depictions of \xe2\x80\x9cnudity,\xe2\x80\x9d while California\xe2\x80\x99s statute concerns extremely violent video games.  But for purposes of vagueness, why should that matter?  Justice Alito argues that the <em>Miller </em>standard sufficed because there are \xe2\x80\x9ccertain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas there are no similarly \xe2\x80\x9caccepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  But there is no evidence that is so.  The Court relied on \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity standards\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Miller</em> precisely because of the difficulty of articulating \xe2\x80\x9caccepted norms\xe2\x80\x9d about depictions of sex.  I can find no difference\xe2\x80\x94historical or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that is <em>relevant</em> to the vagueness question.  Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice Alito relies, do not show anything relevant at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence.  Indeed, sex \xe2\x80\x9chas been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ashcroft </em>v.<em> Free Speech Coalition</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U. S. 234</a>, 246 (2002)<em>.  </em>For every Homer, there is a Titian.  For every Dante, there is an Ovid.  And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif-ferences between California\xe2\x80\x99s law and the New York law upheld in <em>Ginsberg</em>.  And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation.  See <em>Erznoznik</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/index.html">422 U. S. 205</a>, 216 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>Ginsberg</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 644 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); <em>Berry</em> v. <em>Santa Barbara</em>, 40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088\xe2\x80\x931089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute).  Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Video games combine physical action with expression.  Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game in-volving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children.  See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle I\xe2\x80\x94Children\xe2\x80\x99s Product Safety\xe2\x80\x9d).  But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to regulate.  And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the majority, I believe that the California law must be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to further a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest,\xe2\x80\x9d without there being a \xe2\x80\x9cless restrictive\xe2\x80\x9d alternative that would be \xe2\x80\x9cat least as effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 874, 875, 879 (1997).  I would not apply this strict standard \xe2\x80\x9cmechanically.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a>, 841 (2000) (Breyer, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and Scalia, JJ., dissenting).  Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially-justifying \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interests,\xe2\x80\x9d the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute works speech-related harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>Burson</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/191/index.html">504 U.

Applying \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s list of terrorist organizations, <em>Holder</em>, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22\xe2\x80\x9334); but cf. <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 1\xc2\xa0) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, <em>Burson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 210\xe2\x80\x93211 (plurality opinion).  And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, <em>Doe</em> v. <em>Reed</em>, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98closely drawn\xe2\x80\x99 to match a \xe2\x80\x98sufficiently important interest,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U.

See <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/115/index.html">492 U. S. 115</a>, 126 (1989).  Since the Court in <em>Ginsberg</em> specified that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition applied to material that was <em>not </em>obscene, 390 U. S., at 634, I cannot dismiss <em>Ginsberg</em> on the ground that it concerned obscenity.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6 (majority opinion).  Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in <em>Ginsberg</em> insisted only that the legislature have a \xe2\x80\x9crational\xe2\x80\x9d basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children.  390 U. S., at 639.  For in this case, California has substan-tiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger\nevidence.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression.  The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.  \xc2\xa71746.1(c).  All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that the industry <em>itself</em> tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17.  See Brief for Respondents 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a prece-\ndent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or videos, or books.  A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers).  And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie.  See <em>infra</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling.  As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic\xe2\x80\x9d parental claim \xe2\x80\x9cto authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,\xe2\x80\x9d which makes it proper to enact \xe2\x80\x9claws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindependent interest in the well-being of its youth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ginsberg</em>, 390 U. S., at 639\xe2\x80\x93640.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 639, n. 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.\nL. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))).  And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally \xe2\x80\x9cunderinclusive\xe2\x80\x9d for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968\nthat \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98parental control or guidance cannot always be\nprovided.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 390 U. S., at 640.  Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely\nhome alone.  See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who\xe2\x80\x99s Minding the Kids?  Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p.\xc2\xa012 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf.  Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents\xe2\x80\x99 authority to guide their children\xe2\x80\x99s development.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the State\xe2\x80\x99s independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lack of maturity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9cmore vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\xe2\x80\x9d and that their \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter . . . is not as well formed as that of an adult.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 569\xe2\x80\x93570 (2005).  And we have therefore recognized \xe2\x80\x9ca compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sable Communications</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 126.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, there is considerable evidence that California\xe2\x80\x99s statute significantly furthers this compelling interest.  That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools.  Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well.  Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and\nreward the player for performing that task well.  Why\nelse would the Armed Forces incorporate video games\ninto its training?  See CNN, War Games: Military Train-\ning Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at\nhttp://articles.cnn.com\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa02001\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x932\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0tech\xc2\xa0/2war.games_1_ict-\nbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose.  But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue.  In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life.  And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are many scientific studies that support California\xe2\x80\x99s views.  Social scientists, for example, have found <em>causal</em> evidence that playing these games results in harm.  Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period.  See M\xc3\xb6ller &amp; Krah\xc3\xa9, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile &amp; Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J. Youth &amp; Adolescence 127 (2008); Anderson et\xc2\xa0al., Longitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the United States, 122 Pediatrics e1067 (2008); Wallenius &amp; Punam\xc3\xa4ki, Digital Game Violence and Direct Aggression in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Sex, Age, and Parent-Child Communication, 29 J. Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Experimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Anderson et\xc2\xa0al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Surveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Gentile, Lynch, Linder, &amp; Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cutting-edge neuroscience has shown that \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weber, Ritterfeld, &amp; Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-analyses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games \xe2\x80\x9cwas positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cplaying violent video games is a <em>causal</em> risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anderson et\xc2\xa0al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bulletin 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of these studies take care to explain in a common- sense way why video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television.  In essence, they say that the closer a child\xe2\x80\x99s behavior comes, not to watching, but to <em>acting</em> out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm.  See Bushman &amp; Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, &amp; G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed. 2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because \xe2\x80\x9c[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,\xe2\x80\x9d players are \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely to identify with violent characters,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cviolent games directly reward violent behavior\xe2\x80\x9d); Polman, de Castro, &amp; van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children\xe2\x80\x99s Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, &amp; K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television).  See also <em>infra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than \xe2\x80\x9cpassive\xe2\x80\x9d media like television); <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9317 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Experts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions.  (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.)  I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right.  But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children . . . [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people . . . may be <em>significantly more severe</em> than that wrought by television, movies, or music.\xe2\x80\x9d  Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive\nvideo game research suggests such exposure . . . \nincreases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggressive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . decreases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physio-\nlogical arousal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at  http://\xc2\xa0www.apa.org\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0about\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0governance\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0council\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0policy/\ninteractive-media.pdf.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Association added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be <em>more conducive</em> to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFour years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media.  It said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cStudies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be <em>even more profound than those of passive media </em>such as television. In many games the child or teenager is \xe2\x80\x98embedded\xe2\x80\x99 in the game and uses a \xe2\x80\x98joystick\xe2\x80\x99 (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Policy Statement\xe2\x80\x94Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCorrelational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies . . . have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies . . . have revealed similar effects across 2 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children.  This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases.  See <em>Holder</em>, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329) (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s national security judgments); <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/180/index.html">520 U. S. 180</a>, 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s technological judgments).  The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d harm (emphasis deleted)), with <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can find no \xe2\x80\x9cless restrictive\xe2\x80\x9d alternative to California\xe2\x80\x99s law that would be \xe2\x80\x9cat least as effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Reno</em>, 521 U. S., at 874.  The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an \xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x9d (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps.  When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games.  FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/\n07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf.  Subsequently the volun-\ntary program has become more effective.  But as of\nthe FTC\xe2\x80\x99s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this num-\nber rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain.  FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Chil-\ndren 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/\nP994511violententertainment.pdf.  And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today\xe2\x80\x99s broad ruling reduces the industry\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to police itself.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The industry also argues for an alternative technological solution, namely \xe2\x80\x9cfiltering at the console level.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief\nfor Respondents 53.  But it takes only a quick search of \nthe Internet to find guides explaining how to circum-\nvent any such technological controls.  YouTube viewers, for example, have watched one of those guides (called \xe2\x80\x9cHow to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360\xe2\x80\x9d) more than 47,000 times.  See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= CFlVfVmvN6k.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that California\xe2\x80\x99s statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (<em>i.e.,</em> buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most.  That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material).  And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative.  California\xe2\x80\x99s statute is consequently constitutional on its face\xe2\x80\x94though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I add that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law.  <em>Ginsberg </em>makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games.  But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?  What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restrict-\ning sales of that extremely violent video game <em>only</em> when the woman\xe2\x80\x94bound, gagged, tortured, and killed\xe2\x80\x94is also topless?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.  It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and <em>without literary, artistic, or similar justification</em>, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity.  And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view.  That is why I believe that <em>Ginsberg </em>controls the outcome here <em>a fortiori.</em>  And it is why I believe California\xe2\x80\x99s law is constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education.  Our Constitution cannot succeed in  securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work.  Education, however, is about choices.  Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves.  Other times, choices are made for children\xe2\x80\x94by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments.  In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here\xe2\x80\x94a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIXES</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the assistance of the Supreme Court Library, I have compiled these two appendixes listing peer-reviewed academic journal articles on the topic of psychological harm resulting from playing violent video games.  The library conducted a search for relevant articles on the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1, 7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149).  The following search terms were used: \xe2\x80\x9c(video* or computer or arcade or online) and (game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or violen* or hostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens* or empathy).\xe2\x80\x9d  After eliminating irrelevant matches based on title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either supporting the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/rejecting the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful (listed in Appendix B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the California Legislature or the parties in briefing this case.  I list them because they suggest that there is substantial (though controverted) evidence supporting the expert associations of public health professionals that have concluded that violent video games can <em>cause</em> children psychological harm.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  And consequently, these studies help to substantiate the validity of the original judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that judgment\xe2\x80\x99s continuing validity.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnderson &amp; Bushman, Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature, 12 Psychological Science: J.
