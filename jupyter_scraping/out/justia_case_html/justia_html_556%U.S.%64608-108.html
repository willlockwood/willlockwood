After petitioner Flores-Figueroa, a Mexican citizen, gave his employer counterfeit Social Security and alien registration cards containing his name but other people\xe2\x80\x99s identification numbers, he was arrested and charged with two immigration offenses and aggravated identity theft.  Flores moved for acquittal on the latter charge, claiming that the Government could not prove that he <em>knew</em> that the documents\xe2\x80\x99 numbers were assigned to other people.  The District Court agreed with the Government that the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1) does not modify the statute\xe2\x80\x99s last three words, \xe2\x80\x9cof another person,\xe2\x80\x9d and, after trial, found Flores guilty on all counts.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section \xc2\xa71028(a)(1) requires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.  As a matter of ordinary English grammar, \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d is naturally read as applying to all the subsequently listed elements of the crime.  Where a transitive verb has an object, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d) that modifies the verb tells the listener how the subject performed the entire action, including the object.  The Government does not provide a single example of a sentence that, when used in typical fashion, would lead the hearer to a contrary understanding.  And courts ordinarily interpret criminal statutes consistently with the ordinary English usage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Liparota</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/419/index.html">471 U. S. 419</a>.  The Government argues that this position is incorrect because it would either require the same language to be interpreted differently in a neighboring provision or would render the language in that provision superfluous.  This argument fails for two reasons.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The question is whether the statute requires the Government to show that the defendant <em>knew</em> that the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification\xe2\x80\x9d he or she unlawfully transferred, possessed, or used, in fact, belonged to \xe2\x80\x9canother person.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory provision in question references a set of predicate crimes, including, for example, theft of government property, fraud, or engaging in various unlawful activities related to passports, visas, and immigration.  \xc2\xa71028A(c).  It then provides that if any person who commits any of those other crimes (in doing so) \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge must add two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment to the offender\xe2\x80\x99s underlying sentence.  \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1).  All parties agree that the provision applies only where the offender knows that he is transferring, possessing, or using <em>something</em>.  And the Government reluctantly concedes that the offender likely must know that he is transferring, possessing, or using that <em>something</em> without lawful authority.  But they do not agree whether the provision requires that a defendant also know that the <em>something</em> he has unlawfully transferred is, for example, a real ID belonging to another person rather than, say, a fake ID (<em>i.e.</em>, a group of numbers that does not correspond to any real Social Security number).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Ignacio Flores-Figueroa argues that the statute requires that the Government prove that he <em>knew </em>that the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification\xe2\x80\x9d belonged to someone else, <em>i.e.</em>, was \xe2\x80\x9ca means of identification <em>of another person</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that the statute does not impose this particular knowledge requirement.  The Government concedes that the statute uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly,\xe2\x80\x9d but that word, the Government claims, does not modify the statute\xe2\x80\x99s last phrase (\xe2\x80\x9ca means of identification of another person\xe2\x80\x9d) or, at the least, it does not modify the last three words of that phrase (\xe2\x80\x9cof another person\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts of this case illustrate the legal problem.  Ignacio Flores-Figueroa is a citizen of Mexico.  In 2000, to secure employment, Flores gave his employer a false name, birth date, and Social Security number, along with a counterfeit alien registration card.  The Social Security number and the number on the alien registration card were not those of a real person.  In 2006, Flores presented his employer with new counterfeit Social Security and alien registration cards; these cards (unlike Flores\xe2\x80\x99 old alien registration card) used his real name.  But this time the numbers on both cards were in fact numbers assigned to other people.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Flores\xe2\x80\x99 employer reported his request to U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Customs discovered that the numbers on Flores\xe2\x80\x99 new documents belonged to other people.  The United States then charged Flores with two predicate crimes, namely, entering the United States without inspection, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a), and misusing immigration documents, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71546(a).  And it charged him with aggravated identity theft, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1), the crime at issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Flores moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated identity theft\xe2\x80\x9d counts.  He claimed that the Government could not prove that he <em>knew</em> that the numbers on the counterfeit documents were numbers assigned to other people.  The Government replied that it need not prove that knowledge, and the District Court accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  After a bench trial, the court found Flores guilty of the predicate crimes and aggravated identity theft.  The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  274 Fed. Appx. 501 (CA8 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  And we granted certiorari to consider the \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d issue\xe2\x80\x94a matter about which the Circuits have disagreed.  Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Godin</em>, 534 F.\xc2\xa03d 51 (CA1 2008) (knowledge requirement applies to \xe2\x80\x9cof another person\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda-Lopez</em>, 532 F.\xc2\xa03d 1034 (CA9 2008) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villanueva-Sotelo</em>, 515 F.\xc2\xa03d 1234 (CADC 2008) (same), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.\xc2\xa03d 912 (CA8 2008) (knowledge requirement does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cof another person\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurtado</em>, 508 F.\xc2\xa03d 603 (CA11 2007) <em>(per curiam)</em> (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montejo</em>, 442 F.\xc2\xa03d 213 (CA4 2006) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are strong textual reasons for rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  As a matter of ordinary English grammar, it seems natural to read the statute\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d as applying to all the subsequently listed elements of the crime.  The Government cannot easily claim that the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applies only to the statutes first four words, or even its first seven.  It makes little sense to read the provision\xe2\x80\x99s language as heavily penalizing a person who \xe2\x80\x9ctransfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>something, </em>but does not know, at the very least, that the \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d (perhaps inside a box) is a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Would we apply a statute that makes it unlawful \xe2\x80\x9c<em>knowingly</em> to possess drugs\xe2\x80\x9d to a person who steals a passenger\xe2\x80\x99s bag without knowing that the bag has drugs inside?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government claims more forcefully that the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applies to all but the statute\xe2\x80\x99s last three words, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cof another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute, the Government says, does not require a prosecutor to show that the defendant <em>knows</em> that the means of identification the defendant has unlawfully used in fact belongs to another person.  But how are we to square this reading with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an object, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells the listener how the subject performed the entire action, including the object as set forth in the sentence.  Thus, if a bank official says, \xe2\x80\x9cSmith knowingly transferred the funds to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s account,\xe2\x80\x9d we would normally understand the bank official\xe2\x80\x99s statement as telling us that Smith knew the account was his brother\xe2\x80\x99s.  Nor would it matter if the bank official said \xe2\x80\x9cSmith knowingly transferred the funds to the account of his brother.\xe2\x80\x9d  In either instance, if the bank official later told us that Smith did not know the account belonged to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s brother, we should be\nsurprised.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, a statement that does <em>not </em>use the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d may be unclear about just what Smith knows.  Suppose Smith mails his bank draft to Tegucigalpa, which (perhaps unbeknownst to Smith) is the capital of Honduras.  If the bank official says, \xe2\x80\x9cSmith sent a bank draft to the capital of Honduras,\xe2\x80\x9d he has expressed next to nothing about Smith\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of that geographic identity.  But if the official were to say, \xe2\x80\x9cSmith <em>knowingly</em> sent a bank draft to the capital of Honduras,\xe2\x80\x9d then the official has suggested that Smith knows his geography.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similar examples abound.  If a child knowingly takes a toy that belongs to his sibling, we assume that the child not only knows that he is taking something, but that he also knows that what he is taking is a toy <em>and</em> that the toy belongs to his sibling.  If we say that someone knowingly ate a sandwich with cheese, we normally assume that the person knew both that he was eating a sandwich and that it contained cheese.  Or consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own example, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98John knowingly discarded the homework of his sister.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 9.  The Government rightly points out that this sentence \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not <em>necessarily</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>imply that John knew whom the homework belonged to.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  But that is what the sentence, as <em>ordinarily</em> used, does imply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, dissimilar examples are not easy to find.  The Government says that \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only the verbs in the statute, while remaining indifferent to the subject\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of at least part of the transitive verb\xe2\x80\x99s object.  In certain contexts, a listener might understand the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d to be used in that way.  But the Government has not provided us with a single example of a sentence that, when used in typical fashion, would lead the hearer to believe that the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only a transitive verb without the full object, <em>i.e.</em>, that it leaves the hearer gravely uncertain about the subject\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind in respect to the full object of the transitive verb in the sentence.  The likely reason is that such sentences typically involve special contexts or themselves provide a more detailed explanation of background circumstances that call for such a reading.  As Justice Alito notes, the inquiry into a sentence\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is a contextual one.  See <em>post</em>, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  No special context is present here.  See <em>infra</em>, at\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The manner in which the courts ordinarily interpret criminal statutes is fully consistent with this ordinary English usage.  That is to say courts ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that introduces the elements of a crime with the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d as applying that word to each element.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>X-Citement Video, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/64/index.html"></a><a href="/us/513/64/index.html">513 U. S. 64</a>, 79 (1994) (Stevens, J., concurring).  For example, in <em>Liparota</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/419/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/419/index.html">471 U. S. 419</a> (1985), this Court interpreted a federal food stamp statute that said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards <em>in any manner not authorized by [law]</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to imprisonment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 420, n.\xc2\xa01.  The question was whether the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applied to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin any manner not authorized by [law].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 423.  The Court held that it did, <em>id.</em>, at 433, despite the legal cliche \xe2\x80\x9cignorance of the law is no excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More recently, we had to interpret a statute that penalizes \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person who\xe2\x80\x94(1) knowingly transports or ships  using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or mails, any visual depiction, if\xe2\x80\x94(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72252(a)(1)(A); <em>X-Citement Video,</em> <em>supra</em>.  In issue was whether the term \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d in paragraph (1) modified the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (A).  <em>Id.</em>, at 69.  The language in issue in <em>X-Citement</em> <em>Video</em> (like the language in <em>Liparota</em>)<em> </em>was more ambiguous than the language here not only because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d was not the direct object of the verbs modified by \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly,\xe2\x80\x9d but also because it appeared in a different subsection.  513 U. S.,<em> </em>at 68\xe2\x80\x9369.  Moreover, the fact that many sex crimes involving minors do not ordinarily require that a perpetrator know that his victim is a minor supported the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Nonetheless, we again found that the intent element applied to \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of a minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 72, and n.\xc2\xa02.  Again the Government, while pointing to what it believes are special features of each of these cases, provides us with no convincing counterexample, although there may be such statutory instances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government correctly points out that in these cases more was at issue than proper use of the English language.  But if more is at issue here, what is it?  The Government makes a further textual argument, a complex argument based upon a related provision of the statute.  That provision applies \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ggravated identity theft\xe2\x80\x9d where the predicate crime is terrorism.  See \xc2\xa71028A(a)(2).  The provision uses the same language as the provision before us up to the end, where it adds the words \xe2\x80\x9cor a false identification document.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, it penalizes anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person or a false identification document.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71028A(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument has four steps.  Step One: We should not interpret a statute in a manner that makes some of its language superfluous.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>TRW Inc. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 31 (2001).  Step Two: A person who knows that he is transferring, possessing, or using a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98means of identification\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98without lawful authority,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d must know that the document either (a) belongs \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to another person\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or (b) is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98false identification document\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>there are no other choices.</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 14 (emphasis added).<em> </em>Step Three: Requiring the offender to <em>know </em>that the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification\xe2\x80\x9d belongs to another person would consequently be superfluous in this terrorism provision.  Step Four: We should not interpret the same phrase (\xe2\x80\x9cof another person\xe2\x80\x9d) in the two related sections differently.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we understand the argument correctly, it seems to suffer two serious flaws.  If the two listed circumstances (where the ID belongs to another person; where the ID is false) are the only two circumstances possibly present when a defendant (in this particular context) unlawfully uses a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification,\xe2\x80\x9d then why list them at all?  Why not just stop after criminalizing the knowing unlawful use of a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification\xe2\x80\x9d?  (Why specify that Congress does not mean the statute to cover, say, the use of dog tags?)  The fact is, however, that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning at Step Two is faulty.  The two listed circumstances are <em>not </em>the only two circumstances possibly present when a defendant unlawfully uses a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  One could, for example, verbally provide a seller or an employer with a made-up Social Security number, not an \xe2\x80\x9cidentification <em>document,\xe2\x80\x9d </em>and the number verbally transmitted to the seller or employer might, or might not, turn out to belong to another person.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d applied to the \xe2\x80\x9cother person\xe2\x80\x9d requirement (even in a statute that similarly penalizes use of a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse identification <em>document</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) would not be surplus.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also considers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to be a circumstance showing that the linguistic context here is special.  It describes that purpose as \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] enhanced protection for individuals whose identifying information is used to facilitate the commission of crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 5.  And it points out that without the knowledge requirement, potential offenders will take great care to avoid wrongly using IDs that belong to others, thereby enhancing the protection that the statute offers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question, however, is whether Congress intended to achieve this enhanced protection by permitting conviction of those who do not <em>know </em>the ID they unlawfully use refers to a real person, <em>i.e.</em>, those who do not <em>intend</em> to cause this further harm.  And, in respect to this latter point, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history (outside of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language) is inconclusive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the one hand, some statements in the legislative history offer the Government a degree of support.  The  relevant House Report refers, for example, both to \xe2\x80\x9cidentity theft\xe2\x80\x9d (use of an ID belonging to someone else) and to \xe2\x80\x9cidentity fraud\xe2\x80\x9d (use of a false ID), often without distinguishing between the two.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 108\xe2\x80\x93528, p. 25 (2004) (statement of Rep. Coble).  And, in equating fraud and theft, Congress might have meant the statute to cover both\xe2\x80\x94at least where the fraud takes the form of using an ID that (without the offender\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge) belongs to someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, Congress separated the fraud crime from the theft crime in the statute itself.  The title of one provision (not here at issue) is \xe2\x80\x9cFraud and related activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, and information.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71028.  The title of another provision (the provision here at issue) uses the words \xe2\x80\x9cidentity <em>theft.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71028A (emphasis added).  Moreover, the examples of theft that Congress gives in the legislative history all involve instances where the offender would know that what he has taken identifies a different real person.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 108\xe2\x80\x93528, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (identifying as examples of \xe2\x80\x9cidentity theft\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dumpster diving,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caccessing information that was originally collected for an authorized purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chack[ing] into computers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csteal[ing] paperwork likely to contain personal information\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, and perhaps of greatest practical importance, there is the difficulty in many circumstances of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant has the necessary knowledge.  Take an instance in which an alien who unlawfully entered the United States gives an employer identification documents that <em>in fact </em>belong to others.  How is the Government to prove that the defendant <em>knew </em>that this was so?  The Government may be able to show that such a defendant knew the papers were not his.  But perhaps the defendant did not care whether the papers (1) were real papers belonging to another person or (2) were simply counterfeit papers.  The difficulties of proof along with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s necessary guilt of a predicate crime and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s necessary knowledge that he has acted \xe2\x80\x9cwithout lawful authority,\xe2\x80\x9d make it reasonable, in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, to read the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language as dispensing with the knowledge requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not find this argument sufficient, however, to turn the tide in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  For one thing, in the classic case of identity theft, intent is generally not difficult to prove.  For example, where a defendant has used another person\xe2\x80\x99s identification information to get access to that person\xe2\x80\x99s bank account, the Government can prove knowledge with little difficulty.  The same is true when the defendant has gone through someone else\xe2\x80\x99s trash to find discarded credit card and bank statements, or pretends to be from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s bank and requests personal identifying information.  Indeed, the examples of identity theft in the legislative history (dumpster diving, computer hacking, and the like) are all examples of the types of classic identity theft where intent should be relatively easy to prove, and there will be no practical enforcement problem.  For another thing, to the extent that Congress may have been concerned about criminalizing the conduct of a broader class of individuals, the concerns about practical enforceability are insufficient to outweigh the clarity of the text.  Similar interpretations that we have given other similarly phrased statutes also created practical enforcement problems.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>X-Citement Video, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/513/64/index.html"></a><a href="/us/513/64/index.html">513 U. S. 64</a>; <em>Liparota</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/419/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/419/index.html">471 U. S. 419</a>.  But had Congress placed conclusive weight upon practical enforcement, the statute would likely not read the way it now reads.  Instead, Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a list of offense elements.  And we cannot find indications in statements of its purpose or in the practical problems of enforcement sufficient to overcome the ordinary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive practice, of the words that it wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1) requires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962957">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF SCALIA, J.<br/>\nFLORES-FIGUEROA V.

Even the Government must concede that.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Villanueva-Sotelo</em>, 515 F.\xc2\xa03d 1234, 1237 (CADC 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the government, this text is unambiguous: the statute\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge requirement extends only so far as \xe2\x80\x98means of identification\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But once it is understood to modify the object of those verbs, there is no reason to believe it does not extend to the phrase which limits that object (\xe2\x80\x9cof another person\xe2\x80\x9d).  Ordinary English usage supports this reading, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s numerous sample sentences amply demonstrate.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Court is not content to stop at the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, and I do not join that further portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  First, the Court relies in part on the principle that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that introduces the elements of a crime with the word \xe2\x80\x98knowingly\xe2\x80\x99 as applying that word to each element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  If that is meant purely as a description of what most cases do, it is perhaps true, and perhaps not.  I have not canvassed all the cases and am hence agnostic.  If it is meant, however, as a normative description of what courts <em>should </em>ordinarily do when interpreting such statutes\xe2\x80\x94and the reference to Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 concurring opinion in <em>United States</em> v. <em>X-Citement Video, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/64/index.html">513 U. S. 64</a>, 79 (1994), suggests as much\xe2\x80\x94then I surely do not agree.  The structure of the text in <em>X-Citement Video </em>plainly separated the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d element from the \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, wherefore I thought (and think) that case was wrongly decided.  See <em>id.</em>, at 80\xe2\x80\x9381 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  It is one thing to infer the common-law tradition of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement where Congress has not addressed the mental element of a crime.  See <em>Staples</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/600/index.html">511 U. S. 600</a>, 605 (1994); <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Gypsum Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/422/index.html">438 U. S. 422</a>, 437\xe2\x80\x93438 (1978).  It is something else to expand a <em>mens rea </em>requirement that the statutory text has carefully limited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I likewise cannot join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the (as usual, inconclusive) legislative history.  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.  Relying on the statement of a single Member of Congress or an unvoted-upon (and for all we know unread) Committee Report to expand a statute beyond the limits its text suggests is always a dubious enterprise.  And consulting those incunabula with an eye to making criminal what the text would otherwise permit is even more suspect.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/291/index.html">503 U. S. 291</a>, 307\xe2\x80\x93309 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Indeed, it is not unlike the practice of Caligula, who reportedly \xe2\x80\x9cwrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 46 (1765).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text is clear, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on that ground alone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962956">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF ALITO, J.<br/>\nFLORES-FIGUEROA V. UNITED STATES<br/>\n556 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 08-108<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">IGNACIO CARLOS FLORES-FIGUEROA,\nPETITIONER <em>v.</em> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[May 4, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I am in general agreement with the opinion of the Court, I write separately because I am concerned that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion may be read by some as adopting an overly rigid rule of statutory construction.  The Court says that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an object, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells the listener how the subject performed the entire action, including the object as set forth in the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  The Court adds that counterexamples are \xe2\x80\x9cnot easy to find,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 5, and I suspect that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will be cited for the proposition that the <em>mens rea</em> of a federal criminal statute nearly always applies to every element of the offense. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s point about ordinary English usage is overstated.  Examples of sentences that do not conform to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule are not hard to imagine.  For example: \xe2\x80\x9cThe mugger knowingly assaulted two people in the park\xe2\x80\x94an employee of company X and a jogger from town Y.\xe2\x80\x9d  A person hearing this sentence would not likely assume that the mugger knew about the first victim\xe2\x80\x99s employer or the second victim\xe2\x80\x99s home town.  What matters in this example, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, is context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More to the point, ordinary writers do not often construct the particular kind of sentence at issue here, <em>i.e.</em>, a complex sentence in which it is important to determine from the sentence itself whether the adverb denoting the actor\xe2\x80\x99s intent applies to every characteristic of the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s direct object.  Such sentences are a staple of criminal codes, but in ordinary speech, a different formulation is almost always used when the speaker wants to be clear on the point.  For example, a speaker might say: \xe2\x80\x9cFlores-Figueroa used a Social Security number that he knew belonged to someone else\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFlores-Figueroa used a Social Security number that just happened to belong to a real person.\xe2\x80\x9d  But it is difficult to say with the confidence the Court conveys that there is an \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d understanding of the usage of the phrase at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In interpreting a criminal statute such as the one before us, I think it is fair to begin with a general presumption that the specified <em>mens rea</em> applies to all the elements of an offense, but it must be recognized that there are instances in which context may well rebut that presumption.  For example, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72423(a) makes it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly transpor[t] an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that a defendant need not know the victim\xe2\x80\x99s age to be guilty under this statute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Griffith</em>, 284 F.\xc2\xa03d 338, 350\xe2\x80\x93351 (CA2 2002); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 239 F.\xc2\xa03d 994, 997 (CA9 2001); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Chin</em>, 981 F.\xc2\xa02d 1275, 1280 (CADC 1992) (Ginsburg, J.) (holding that 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7861(a)(1), which makes it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally . . . employ, hire, use, persuade, induce, entice, or coerce, a person under eighteen years of age to violate\xe2\x80\x9d drug laws, does not require the defendant to have knowledge of the minor\xe2\x80\x99s age).  Similarly, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71327 makes it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly ai[d] or assis[t] any alien inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) (insofar as an alien inadmissible under such section has been convicted of an aggravated felony) \xe2\x80\xa6 to enter the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Courts of Appeals have held that the term \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d in this context does not require the defendant to know that the alien had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Flores-Garcia</em>, 198 F.\xc2\xa03d 1119, 1121\xe2\x80\x931123 (CA9 2000); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Figueroa</em>, 165 F.\xc2\xa03d 111, 118\xe2\x80\x93119 (CA2 1998).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, however, the Government has not pointed to contextual features that warrant interpreting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1) in a similar way.  Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation leads to exceedingly odd results.  Under that interpretation, if a defendant uses a made-up Social Security number without having any reason to know whether it belongs to a real person, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability under \xc2\xa71028A(a)(1) depends on chance: If it turns out that the number belongs to a real person, two years will be added to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, but if the defendant is lucky and the number does not belong to another person, the statute is not violated.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I therefore concur in the judgment and join the opinion of the Court except insofar as it may be read to adopt an inflexible rule of construction that can rarely be overcome by contextual features pointing to a contrary reading.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
