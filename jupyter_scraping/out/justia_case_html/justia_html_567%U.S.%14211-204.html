Congress did not elaborate on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman,\xe2\x80\x9d but it delegated authority to the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.  Three of the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations are relevant to this case.  First, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.500 defines \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany employee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [w]hose primary duty is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. making sales within the meaning of [\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(k)].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7541.500(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  Section 203(k), in turn, states that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]ale\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98sell\xe2\x80\x99 includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, \xc2\xa7541.501 clarifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ales within the meaning of [\xc2\xa7203(k)] include the transfer of title to tangible property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7541.501(b).  Third, \xc2\xa7541.503 provides that promotion work that is \xe2\x80\x9cperformed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas promotion work that is \xe2\x80\x9cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7541.503(a).  The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman\xe2\x80\x9d when the employee \xe2\x80\x9cin some sense, has made sales.\xe2\x80\x9d  69 Fed.

In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts on physicians.  Pharmaceutical companies promote their products to physicians through a process called \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby employees known as \xe2\x80\x9cdetailers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpharmaceutical sales representatives\xe2\x80\x9d try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from physicians to prescribe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s products in appropriate cases.  Each week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physicians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks.  Petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and they were subject to only minimal supervision.  Petitioners were well compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a base salary and incentive pay.  The amount of incentive pay was determined based on the performance of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 assigned portfolio of drugs in their assigned sales territories.  It is undisputed that petitioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more than 40 hours per week.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA by failing to compensate them for overtime.  Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were \xe2\x80\x9cemployed in the capacity of outside salesman,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt from the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s overtime compensation requirement.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.  Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.  The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.  The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was not entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.

The DOL changed course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and now maintains that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n employee does not make a \xe2\x80\x98sale\xe2\x80\x99  . . . unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s current interpretation of its regulations is not entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n.  Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461\xe2\x80\x93462, this general rule does not apply in all cases.  Deference is inappropriate, for example, when the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 461, or when there is reason to suspect that the interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 462.  There are strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case.  Petitioners invoke the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the interpretation was announced.  To defer to the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would result in precisely the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cunfair surprise\xe2\x80\x9d against which this Court has long warned.  See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 158\n\xe2\x80\x93171.  Until 2009, the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the FLSA.  The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice.  Even more important, despite the industry\xe2\x80\x99s decades-long practice, the DOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully.  The only plausible explanation for the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s inaction is acquiescence.  Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is unwarranted here.  The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation should instead be given a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade.  See United States v. Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s current interpretation\xe2\x80\x94that a sale demands a transfer of title\xe2\x80\x94is quite unpersuasive.  It plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.  Because the DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public comment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.  The interpretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA.  The statute defines \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d to mean, inter alia, a \xe2\x80\x9cconsignment for sale,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cconsignment for sale\xe2\x80\x9d does not involve the transfer of title.  The DOL relies heavily on 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.501, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ales . . . include the transfer of title to tangible property,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7541.501(b), but it is apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d  The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexplanation that obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion, and not sales,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also unconvincing.  Since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s own sales is exempt, the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.

The statute\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity\xe2\x80\x9d counsels in favor of a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an employee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.  The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations provide additional guidance.  Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sales\xe2\x80\x9d and adopts the statu- tory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d  This statutory definition contains at least three important textual clues.  First, the definition is introduced with the verb \xe2\x80\x9cincludes,\xe2\x80\x9d which indicates that the examples enumerated in the text are illustrative, not exhaustive.  See Burgess v. United States, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124\n, n.\xc2\xa03.  Second, the list of transactions included in the statutory definition is modified by \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d which, in the context of \xc2\xa7203(k), is best read to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Gonzales, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  Third, the definition includes the broad catchall phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the rule of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase is most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that are tantamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a commodity.  Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrower construction.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0Given this interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition,\xe2\x80\x9d it follows that petitioners made sales under the FLSA and thus are exempt outside salesmen within the meaning of the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  Petitioners obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s drugs.  This kind of arrangement, in the unique regula- tory environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate, comfortably falls within the catchall category of \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides further support for this conclusion.  And this holding also comports with the apparent purpose of the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s exemption.  The exemption is premised on the belief that exempt employees normally earn salaries well above the minimum wage and perform a kind of work that is difficult to standardize to a particular time frame and that cannot easily be spread to other workers.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x94each of whom earned an average of more than $70,000 per year and spent 10 to 20 hours outside normal business hours each week performing work related to his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory\xe2\x80\x94are hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was intended to protect.

See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations of the Presiding Officer at Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Report); Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on Proposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541 (1949) (hereinafter 1949 Report); 69 Fed.

The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation, including the now-familiar requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physician\xe2\x80\x99s prescription.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts, not on the retail pharmacies that dispense prescription drugs, but rather on the medi- cal practitioners who possess the authority to prescribe the drugs in the first place.  Pharmaceutical companies promote their prescription drugs to physicians through a process called \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby employees known as \xe2\x80\x9cdetailers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpharmaceutical sales representatives\xe2\x80\x9d provide information to physicians about the company\xe2\x80\x99s products in hopes of persuading them to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.  See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932) (describing the process of \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing\xe2\x80\x9d).  The position of \xe2\x80\x9cdetailer\xe2\x80\x9d has existed in the pharmaceutical industry in substantially its current form since at least the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, and in recent years the industry has employed more than 90,000 detailers nationwide.

In both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, the DOL took the view that \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98sale\xe2\x80\x99 for the purposes of the outside sales exemption requires a con- summated transaction directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s Novartis Brief 11; see also Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in No. 10\xe2\x80\x9315257 (CA9), p. 12.

Deference is undoubtedly inappropriate, for example, when the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v.

Until 2009, the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the FLSA.  The statute and regulations certainly do not provide clear notice of this.  The general regulation adopts the broad statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csale,\xe2\x80\x9d and that definition, in turn, employs the broad catchall phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.500(a)(1).  This catchall phrase could reasonably be construed to encompass a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe a particular drug, and nothing in the statutory or regulatory text or the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s prior guidance plainly requires a contrary reading.  See Preamble 22162 (explaining that an employee must \xe2\x80\x9cin some sense\xe2\x80\x9d make a sale); 1940 Report 46 (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven more important, despite the industry\xe2\x80\x99s decades-long practice of classifying pharmaceutical detailers as exempt employees, the DOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F16" name="T16">\n\t\t\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We acknowledge that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement decisions are informed by a host of factors, some bearing no relation to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views regarding whether a violation has occurred.

There are now approximately 90,000 pharmaceutical sales representatives; the nature of their work has not materially changed for decades and is well known; these employees are well paid; and like quintessential outside salesmen, they do not punch a clock and often work more than 40 hours per week.

The interpretation to which we are now asked to defer\xe2\x80\x94that a sale demands a transfer of title\xe2\x80\x94plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.  Because the DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public comment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the Department\xe2\x80\x99s internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.  After arguing successfully in the Second Circuit and then unsucess- fully in the Ninth Circuit that a sale for present purposes simply requires a \xe2\x80\x9cconsummated transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d the DOL advanced a different interpretation in this Court.

Much the same may be said about a physician\xe2\x80\x99s nonbinding commitment to prescribe a particular product in an appropriate case.  In that situation, too, agreement may eventually result in the transfer of title (from the manufacturer to a pharmacy and ultimately to the patient for whom the drug is prescribed).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn support of its new interpretation, the DOL relies heavily on its sales regulation, which states in part that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ales [for present purposes] include the transfer of title to tangible property,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.501(b) (emphasis added).  This regulation, however, provides little support for the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The DOL reads the sales regulation to mean that a \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily includes the transfer of title, but that is not what the regulation says.  And it seems clear that that is not what the regulation means.  The sentence just subsequent to the one on which the DOL relies, echoing the terms of the FLSA, makes clear that a \xe2\x80\x9cconsignment for sale\xe2\x80\x9d qualifies as a sale.  Since a consignment for sale does not involve a transfer of title, it is apparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners invite us to look past the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination that a sale must involve the transfer of title\xe2\x80\x9d and instead defer to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexplanation that obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion, and not sales.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 17.  The problem with the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the promotion-work regulation, however, is that it depends almost entirely on the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s flawed transfer-of-title interpretation.  The promotion-work regulation does not distinguish between promotion work and sales; rather, it distinguishes between exempt promotion work and nonexempt promotion work.  Since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s own sales is exempt, the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.  For the reasons already discussed, we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of our conclusion that the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its own right, we must employ traditional tools of interpretation to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with the text of the FLSA.  Although the provision that establishes the overtime salesman exemption does not furnish a clear answer to the question before us, it provides at least one interpretive clue: It exempts anyone \xe2\x80\x9cemployed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(1) (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cCapacity,\xe2\x80\x9d used in this sense, means \xe2\x80\x9c[o]utward condition or circumstances; relation; character; position.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2 Oxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (\xe2\x80\x9cPosition, condition, character, relation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity\xe2\x80\x9d of the employee counsels in favor of a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an employee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations provide additional guidance.  The general regulation defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sales,\xe2\x80\x9d and it adopts the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.500(a)(1)(i).  This definition contains at least three important textual clues.  First, the definition is introduced with the verb \xe2\x80\x9cincludes\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d  This word choice is significant because it makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.  See Burgess v. United States, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124\n, n.\xc2\xa03 (2008) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] term whose statutory definition declares what it \xe2\x80\x98includes\xe2\x80\x99 is more susceptible to extension of meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. than where .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the definition declares what a term \xe2\x80\x98means\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration in original; some internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, Congress used the narrower word \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d in other provisions of the FLSA when it wanted to cabin a definition to a specific list of enumerated items.  See, e.g., \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Person\xe2\x80\x99 means an individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal representative, or any organized group of persons\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the list of transactions included in the statu- tory definition of sale is modified by the word \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have recognized that the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent things depending upon the setting,\xe2\x80\x9d Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125, \n132 (2004)\n, but in the context of \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(k), it is best read to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d United States v.

That is so because Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d to include both the unmodified word \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d and transactions that might not be considered sales in a technical sense, including exchanges and consignments for sale.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F18" name="T18">\n\t\t\t\t\t18\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, Congress also included a broad catchall phrase:  \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neither the statute nor the regulations define \xe2\x80\x9cdisposition,\xe2\x80\x9d but dictionary definitions of the term range from \xe2\x80\x9crelinquishment or alienation\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9carrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he getting rid, or making over, of anything; relinquishment or alienation\xe2\x80\x9d); ibid.

Brief 20, is much too narrow, as is petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that a sale requires a \xe2\x80\x9cfirm agreement\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfirm commitment\xe2\x80\x9d to buy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 64, 66.  These interpretations would defeat Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to define \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d in a broad manner and render the general statutory language meaningless.  See United States v.

Indeed, we are hard pressed to think of any contract for the exchange of goods or services in return for value or any firm agreement to buy that would not also fall within one of the specifically enumerated categories.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F20" name="T20">\n\t\t\t\t\t20\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe specific list of transactions that precedes the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition\xe2\x80\x9d seems to us to represent an attempt to accommodate industry-by-industry variations in methods of selling commodities.  Consequently, we think that the catchall phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition\xe2\x80\x9d is most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that are tantamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a commodity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrower construction.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F21" name="T21">\n\t\t\t\t\t21\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As discussed above, the sales regulation instructs that sales within the meaning of \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(k) \xe2\x80\x9cinclude the transfer of title to tangible property,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.501(b) (emphasis added), but this regulation in no way limits the broad statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d  And although the promotion-work regulation distinguishes between promotion work that is incidental to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s own sales and work that is incidental to sales made by someone else, see \xc2\xa7541.503(a), this distinction tells us nothing about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F22" name="T22">\n\t\t\t\t\t22\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven our interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition,\xe2\x80\x9d it follows that petitioners made sales for purposes of the FLSA and therefore are exempt outside salesmen within the meaning of the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  Obtaining a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to ensure the eventual disposition of the products that respondent sells.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F23" name="T23">\n\t\t\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  This kind of arrangement, in the unique regulatory environment within which pharmaceutical companies must operate, comfortably falls within the catch- all category of \xe2\x80\x9cother disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides further support for our conclusion.  Petitioners were hired for their sales experience.  They were trained to close each sales call by obtaining the maximum commitment possible from the physician.  They worked away from the office, with minimal supervision, and they were rewarded for their efforts with incentive compensation.  It would be anomalous to require respondent to compensate petitioners for overtime, while at the same time exempting employees who function identically to petitioners in every respect except that they sell physician-administered drugs, such as vaccines and other inject- able pharmaceuticals, that are ordered by the physician directly rather than purchased by the end user at a pharmacy with a prescription from the physician.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur holding also comports with the apparent purpose of the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for outside salesmen.  The exemption is premised on the belief that exempt employees \xe2\x80\x9ctypically earned salaries well above the minimum wage\xe2\x80\x9d and enjoyed other benefits that \xe2\x80\x9cse[t] them apart from the nonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Preamble 22124.  It was also thought that exempt employees performed a kind of work that \xe2\x80\x9cwas difficult to standardize to any time frame and could not be easily spread to other workers after 40 hours in a week, making compliance with the overtime provisions difficult and generally precluding the potential job expansion intended by the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s time-and-a-half overtime premium.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x94each of whom earned an average of more than $70,000 per year and spent between 10 and 20 hours outside normal business hours each week performing work related to his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory\xe2\x80\x94are hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was intended to protect.  And it would be challenging, to say the least, for pharmaceutical companies to compensate detailers for overtime going forward without significantly changing the nature of that position.  See, e.g., Brief for PhRMA as Amicus Curiae 14\xe2\x80\x9320 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ckey aspects of [detailers\xe2\x80\x99] jobs as they are currently structured are fundamentally incompatible with treating [detailers] as hourly employees\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe remaining arguments advanced by petitioners and the dissent are unavailing.  Petitioners contend that detailers are more naturally classified as nonexempt promotional employees who merely stimulate sales made by others than as exempt outside salesmen.

But, taken to its extreme, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 theory would require that we treat as a nonexempt promotional employee a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s representative who takes an order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a jobber\xe2\x80\x99s employee to be filled, or a car salesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his or her assistant to enter the order into the computer.  This formalistic approach would be difficult to reconcile with the broad language of the regulations and the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csale,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is in significant ten- sion with the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s past practice.  See 1949 Report 83 (explaining that the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s representative was clearly \xe2\x80\x9cperforming sales work regardless of the fact that the order is filled by the jobber rather than directly by his own employer\xe2\x80\x9d); Preamble 22162 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological changes in how orders are taken and processed should not preclude the exemption for employees who in some sense make the sales\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners additionally argue that detailers are the functional equivalent of employees who sell a \xe2\x80\x9cconcept,\xe2\x80\x9d and they point to Wage and Hour Division opinion letters, as well as lower court decisions, deeming such employees nonexempt.

Ante, at 14.  Thus, I am willing to assume, with the Court, that we should determine whether the statutory term covers the detailer\xe2\x80\x99s job as here  described through our independent examination of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and the related Labor Department regulations.  But, I conclude on that basis that a detailer is not an \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FLSA does not itself define the term \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it exempts from wage and hour requirements  \xe2\x80\x9cany employee employed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(1) (emphasis added).

The first is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral rule for outside sales employees,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.500 (2011); the second is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cMaking sales or obtaining orders,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7541.501; and the third is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPromotion work,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7541.503.  The relevant language of the first two regulations is similar.  The first says that the term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall mean any employee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The second regulation tells us that the first regulation \xe2\x80\x9crequires that the employee be engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. (1) Making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (2) Obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7541.501(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second part of these quoted passages is irrelevant here, for it concerns matters not at issue, namely \xe2\x80\x9corders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  The remaining parts of the two regulations are similarly irrelevant.  See Appendix, infra.  Thus, the relevant portions of the first two regulations say simply that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary duty\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa73(k) of the Act says that the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Sale\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98sell\xe2\x80\x99 includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(k).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnless we give the words of the statute and regulations some special meaning, a detailer\xe2\x80\x99s primary duty is not that of \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sales\xe2\x80\x9d or the equivalent.  A detailer might convince a doctor to prescribe a drug for a particular kind of patient.  If the doctor encounters such a patient, he might prescribe the drug.  The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s client, the patient, might take the prescription to a pharmacist and ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription.  If so, the pharmacist might sell the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s drug to the patient, or might substitute a generic version.  But it is the pharmacist, not the detailer, who will have sold the drug.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo put the same fairly obvious point in the language of the regulations and of \xc2\xa73(k) of the FLSA, see \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(k), the detailer does not \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d anything to the doctor.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1454 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he transfer of property or title for a price\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor does he, during the course of that visit or immedi-ately thereafter, \xe2\x80\x9cexchange\xe2\x80\x9d the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s product for money or for anything else.  He enters into no \xe2\x80\x9ccontract to sell\xe2\x80\x9d on behalf of anyone.  He \xe2\x80\x9cconsigns\xe2\x80\x9d nothing \xe2\x80\x9cfor sale.\xe2\x80\x9d  He \xe2\x80\x9cships\xe2\x80\x9d nothing for sale.  He does not \xe2\x80\x9cdispose\xe2\x80\x9d of any product at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat the detailer does is inform the doctor about the nature of the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s drugs and explain their uses, their virtues, their drawbacks, and their limitations.  The detailer may well try to convince the doctor to prescribe the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s drugs for patients.  And if the detailer is successful, the doctor will make a \xe2\x80\x9cnonbinding commitment\xe2\x80\x9d to write prescriptions using one or more of those drugs where appropriate.  If followed, that \xe2\x80\x9cnonbinding commitment\xe2\x80\x9d is, at most, a nonbinding promise to consider advising a patient to use a drug where medical indications so indicate (if the doctor encounters such a patient), and to write a prescription that will likely (but may not) lead that person to order that drug under its brand name from the pharmacy.  (I say \xe2\x80\x9cmay not\xe2\x80\x9d because 30% of patients in a 2-year period have not filled a prescription given to them by a doctor.  See USA Today, Kaiser Family Foundation, Harvard School of Public Health, The Public on Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceutical Companies 3 (2008), available at http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/7748.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  And when patients do fill prescriptions, 75% are filled with generic drugs.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Science &amp; Data Policy, Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 2 (2010).)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhere in this process does the detailer sell the product?  At most he obtains from the doctor a \xe2\x80\x9cnonbinding commitment\xe2\x80\x9d to advise his patient to take the drug (or perhaps a generic equivalent) as well as to write any necessary prescription.  I put to the side the fact that neither the Court nor the record explains exactly what a \xe2\x80\x9cnonbinding commitment\xe2\x80\x9d is.  Like a \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite maybe,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cimpos-sible solution,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical experience,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cnonbinding commitment\xe2\x80\x9d seems to claim more than it can deliver.  Regardless, other than in colloquial speech, to obtain a commitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to obtain a commitment to sell that product, no matter how often the client takes the advice (or the patient does what the doctor recommends).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe third regulation, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPromotion work,\xe2\x80\x9d lends support to this view.  That is because the detailer\xe2\x80\x99s work as described above is best viewed as promotion work.  The regulation makes clear that promotion work falls within the statutory exemption only when the promotion work \xe2\x80\x9cis actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s own outside sales or solicitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7541.503(a) (emphasis added).  But it is not exempt if it is \xe2\x80\x9cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe detailer\xe2\x80\x99s work, in my view, is more naturally characterized as involving \xe2\x80\x9c[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate sales .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made by someone else,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7541.503, e.g., the pharmacist or the wholesaler, than as involving \xe2\x80\x9c[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate\xe2\x80\x9d the detailer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown sales.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThree other relevant documents support this reading.  First, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), of which respondent is a mem- ber, publishes a \xe2\x80\x9cCode on Interactions with Healthcare Pro-fessionals.\xe2\x80\x9d  See PhRMA, Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code) (rev. July 2008), available at http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/108/ phrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf.  The PhRMA Code de-scribes a detailer\xe2\x80\x99s job in some depth.  It consistently refers to detailers as \xe2\x80\x9cdelivering accurate, up-to-date information to healthcare professionals,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 14, and it stresses the importance of a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s treatment decision being based \xe2\x80\x9csolely on each patient\xe2\x80\x99s medical needs\xe2\x80\x9d and the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmedical knowledge and experience,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 2.  The PhRMA Code also forbids the offering or providing of anything \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner or on conditions that would interfere with the independence of a healthcare professional\xe2\x80\x99s prescribing practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 13.  But the PhRMA Code nowhere refers to detailers as if they were salesmen, rather than providers of information, nor does it refer to any kind of commitment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo the contrary, the document makes clear that the pharmaceutical industry itself understands that it cannot be a detailer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary duty\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain a nonbinding commitment, for, in respect to many doctors, such a commitment taken alone is unlikely to make a significant difference to their doctor\xe2\x80\x99s use of a particular drug.  When a particular drug, say Drug D, constitutes the best treatment for a particular patient, a knowledgeable doctor should (hence likely will) prescribe it irrespective of any nonbinding commitment to do so.  Where some other drug, however, is likely to prove more beneficial for a particular patient, that doctor should not (hence likely will not) prescribe Drug D irrespective of any nonbinding commitment to the contrary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt a minimum, the document explains why a detailer should not (hence likely does not) see himself as seeking primarily to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular drug, as opposed to providing information so that the doctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward using it when appropriate.  And because the detailer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary duty\xe2\x80\x9d is informational, as opposed to sales-oriented, he fails to qualify as an outside salesman.  See \xc2\xa7541.500(a)(1)(i) (restricting the outside salesman exemption to employees \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hose primary duty is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. making sales\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  A detailer operating in accord with the PhRMA Code \xe2\x80\x9csells\xe2\x80\x9d the product only in the way advertisers (particularly very low key advertisers) \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d a product: by creating demand for the product, not by taking orders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, a Labor Department Wage and Hour Division Report written in 1940 further describes the work of \xe2\x80\x9csales promotion men.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations of the Presiding Officer at Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940) (1940 Report).

And the detailers are primarily interested in sales authorized by the doctor, not to the doctor.  According to the 1940 Report, sales promotion men are not \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesmen,\xe2\x80\x9d primarily because they seek to bring about, not their own sales, but sales by others.  Thus, the detailers in this case are not \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, a Wage and Hour Division Report written in 1949 notes that where \xe2\x80\x9cwork is promotional in nature it is sometimes difficult to determine whether it is incidental to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own sales work.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on Proposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541, p. 82 (1949) (1949 Report).

But the law might preclude an industry from selling its products through an outside salesman without thereby leading the legal term \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman\xe2\x80\x9d to apply to whatever is the next best thing.  In any event, the Court would be wrong to assume, if it does assume, that there is in nearly every industry an outside salesman lurking somewhere (if only we can find him).

But there is no need for any such fear.  Both these examples involve employees who are salesmen because they obtain a firm commitment to buy the product.  See 1949 Report 83 (as to the first example, such an employee \xe2\x80\x9chas obtained a commitment from the customer\xe2\x80\x9d); 69 Fed.

Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The problem for the detailers, however, is that the statute seeks to achieve its general objectives by creating certain categories of exempt employees, one of which is the category of \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d  It places into that category only those who satisfy the definition of \xe2\x80\x9coutside sales- man\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cdefined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Such an employee can be considered an exempt outside sales employee if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s primary duty is making sales or contracts.

The arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee\'s own outside sales. Because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt outside sales work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
