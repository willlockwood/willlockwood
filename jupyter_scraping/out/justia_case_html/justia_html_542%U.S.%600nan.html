Argued December 9, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 28, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Seibert feared charges of neglect when her son, afflicted with cerebral palsy, died in his sleep.  She was present when two of her sons and their friends discussed burning her family\xe2\x80\x99s mobile home to conceal the circumstances of her son\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Donald, an unrelated mentally ill 18-year-old living with the family, was left to die in the fire, in order to avoid the appearance that Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s son had been unattended.  Five days later, the police arrested Seibert, but did not read her her rights under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>.  At the police station, Officer Hanrahan questioned her for 30 to 40 minutes, obtaining a confession that the plan was for Donald to die in the fire.  He then gave her a 20-minute break, returned to give her <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and obtained a signed waiver.  He resumed questioning, confronting Seibert with her prewarning statements and getting her to repeat the information.  Seibert moved to suppress both her prewarning and postwarning statements.  Hanrahan testified that he made a conscious decision to withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings, question first, then give the warnings, and then repeat the question until he got the answer previously given.  The District Court suppressed the prewarning statement but admitted the postwarning one, and Seibert was convicted of second-degree murder.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, finding the case indistinguishable from <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, in which this Court held that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned inculpatory statement made during a brief exchange at his house did not make a later, fully warned inculpatory statement inadmissible.  In reversing, the State Supreme Court held that, because the interrogation was nearly continuous, the second statement, which was clearly the product of the invalid first statement, should be suppressed; and distinguished <em>Elstad</em> on the ground that the warnings had not intentionally been withheld there.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">93 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 700, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded that, because the midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession in this case could not comply with <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional warning requirement, Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s postwarning statements are inadmissible.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.  Conversely, giving the warnings and getting a waiver generally produces a virtual ticket of admissibility, with most litigation over voluntariness ending with valid waiver finding.  This common consequence would not be at all common unless <em>Miranda</em> warnings were customarily given under circumstances that reasonably suggest a real choice between talking and not talking.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, reaffirmed <em>Miranda,</em> holding that <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional character prevailed against a federal statute that sought to restore the old regime of giving no warnings and litigating most statements\xe2\x80\x99 voluntariness.  The technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases raises a new challenge to <em>Miranda.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0When a confession so obtained is offered and challenged, attention must be paid to the conflicting objects of <em>Miranda</em> and the question-first strategy.  <em>Miranda</em> addressed \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogation practices \xe2\x80\xa6 likely \xe2\x80\xa6 to disable [an individual] from making a free and rational choice\xe2\x80\x9d about speaking, 384 U. S., at 464\xe2\x80\x93465, and held that a suspect must be \xe2\x80\x9cadequately and effectively\xe2\x80\x9d advised of the choice the Constitution guarantees, <em>id.,</em> at 467.  Question-first\xe2\x80\x99s object, however, is to render <em>Miranda </em>warnings ineffective by waiting to give them until after the suspect has already confessed.  The threshold question in this situation is whether it would be reasonable to find that the warnings could function \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d as <em>Miranda</em> requires.  There is no doubt about the answer.  By any objective measure, it is likely that warnings withheld until after interrogation and confession will be ineffective in preparing a suspect for successive interrogation, close in time and similar in content.  The manifest purpose of question-first is to get a confession the suspect would not make if he understood his rights at the outset.  When the warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 424.  And it would be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated and proximately conducted questioning as independent interrogations subject to independent evaluation simply because <em>Miranda</em> warnings formally punctuate them in the middle.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0<em>Elstad </em>does not authorize admission of a confession repeated under the question-first strategy.  The contrast between <em>Elstad </em>and this case reveals relevant facts bearing on whether midstream<em> Miranda</em> warnings could be effective to accomplish their object: the completeness and detail of the questions and answers to the first round of questioning, the two statements\xe2\x80\x99 overlapping content, the timing and setting of the first and second rounds, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator\xe2\x80\x99s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.  In <em>Elstad,</em> the station house questioning could sensibly be seen as a distinct experience from a short conversation at home, and thus the <em>Miranda</em> warnings could have made sense as presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up on the earlier admission.  Here, however, the unwarned interrogation was conducted in the station house, and the questioning was systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill.  The warned phase proceeded after only a 15-to-20 minute pause, in the same place and with the same officer, who did not advise Seibert that her prior statement could not be used against her.  These circumstances challenge the comprehensibility and efficacy of the <em>Miranda</em> warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s shoes could not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy concluded that when a two-step interrogation technique is used, postwarning statements related to prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.  Not every violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, requires suppression of the evidence obtained.  Admission may be proper when it would further important objectives without compromising <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central concerns.  See, <em>e.g., Harris</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/index.html">401 U. S. 222</a>. <em> Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, reflects a balanced and pragmatic approach to enforcing the <em>Miranda</em> warning.  An officer may not realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are required, and may not plan to question the suspect or may be waiting for a more appropriate time.  Suppressing postwarning statements under such circumstances would serve \xe2\x80\x9cneither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Elstad, supra, </em>at 308.  In contrast, the technique used in this case distorts <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s meaning and furthers no legitimate countervailing interest.  The warning was withheld to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the admonition when finally given.  That the interrogating officer relied on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prewarning statement to obtain the postwarning one used at trial shows the temptations for abuse inherent in the two-step technique.  Reference to the prewarning statement was an implicit, and false, suggestion that the mere repetition of the earlier statement was not independently incriminating.  The <em>Miranda</em> rule would be frustrated were the police permitted to undermine its meaning and effect.  However, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94that whenever a two-stage interview occurs, the postwarning statement\xe2\x80\x99s admissibility depends on whether the midstream warnings could have been effective enough to accomplish their object given the case\xe2\x80\x99s specific facts\xe2\x80\x94cuts too broadly.  The admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by <em>Elstad</em>\xe2\x80\x99s principles unless the deliberate two-step strategy is employed.  Then, the postwarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before they were made.  Such measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning and waiver.  For example,<em> </em>a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the warning may suffice in most instances, as may an additional warning explaining the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning statement.  Because no curative steps were taken in this case, the postwarning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot stand.

Although such a statement is generally inadmissible, since taken in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v.<em> Arizona</em>, 384 U. S.436 (1966), the interrogating officer follows it with <em>Miranda</em> warnings and then leads the suspect to cover the same ground a second time.  The question here is the admissibility of the repeated statement.  Because this midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession could not effectively comply with <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional requirement, we hold that a statement repeated after a warning in such circumstances is inadmissible.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Patrice Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s 12-year-old son Jonathan had cerebral palsy, and when he died in his sleep she feared charges of neglect because of bedsores on his body.  In her presence, two of her teenage sons and two of their friends devised a plan to conceal the facts surrounding Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s death by incinerating his body in the course of burning the family\xe2\x80\x99s mobile home, in which they planned to leave Donald Rector, a mentally ill teenager living with the family, to avoid any appearance that Jonathan had been unattended.  Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s son Darian and a friend set the fire, and Donald died.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Five days later, the police awakened Seibert at 3 a.m. at a hospital where Darian was being treated for burns.  In arresting her, Officer Kevin Clinton followed instructions from Rolla, Missouri, officer Richard Hanrahan that he refrain from giving <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  After Seibert had been taken to the police station and left alone in an interview room for 15 to 20 minutes, Hanrahan questioned her without <em>Miranda</em> warnings for 30 to 40 minutes, squeezing her arm and repeating \xe2\x80\x9cDonald was also to die in his sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 59 (internal quotation marks omitted).  After Seibert finally admitted she knew Donald was meant to die in the fire, she was given a 20-minute coffee and cigarette break.  Officer Hanrahan then turned on a tape recorder, gave Seibert the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and obtained a signed waiver of rights from her.  He resumed the questioning with \xe2\x80\x9cOk, \xe2\x80\x99trice, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking for a little while about what happened on Wednesday the twelfth, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?,\xe2\x80\x9d App.<em> </em>66, and confronted her with her prewarning statements:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hanrahan: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, in discussion you told us, you told us</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0that there was a[n] understanding about Donald.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seibert: \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hanrahan: \xe2\x80\x9cDid that take place earlier that morning?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seibert: \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hanrahan: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was the understanding about</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Donald?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seibert: \xe2\x80\x9cIf they could get him out of the trailer, to take \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0him out of the trailer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hanrahan: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seibert: \xe2\x80\x9cI, I never even thought about it.

At the suppression hearing, Officer Hanrahan testified that he made a \xe2\x80\x9cconscious decision\xe2\x80\x9d to withhold <em>Miranda</em> warnings, thus resorting to an interrogation technique he had been taught: question first, then give the warnings, and then repeat the question \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I get the answer that she\xe2\x80\x99s already provided once.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 31\xe2\x80\x9334.  He acknowledged that Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate statement was \xe2\x80\x9clargely a repeat of information \xe2\x80\xa6 obtained\xe2\x80\x9d prior to the warning.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court suppressed the prewarning statement but admitted the responses given after the <em>Miranda</em> recitation.  A jury convicted Seibert of second-degree murder.  On appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, treating this case as indistinguishable from <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

Since there were \xe2\x80\x9cno circumstances that would seem to dispel the effect of the <em>Miranda</em> violation,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held that the postwarning confession was involuntary and therefore inadmissible.  <em>Ibid</em>.  To allow the police to achieve an \xe2\x80\x9cend run\xe2\x80\x9d around <em>Miranda</em>, the court explained, would encourage <em>Miranda</em> violations and diminish <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s role in protecting the privilege against self-incrimination.  93 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 706\xe2\x80\x93707.

Although we have no statistics on the frequency of this practice, it is not confined to Rolla, Missouri.  An officer of that police department testified that the strategy of withholding <em>Miranda</em> warnings until after interrogating and drawing out a confession was promoted not only by his own department, but by a national police training organization and other departments in which he had worked.  App. 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  Consistently with the officer\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the Police Law Institute, for example, instructs that \xe2\x80\x9cofficers may conduct a two-stage interrogation\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. At any point during the pre-<em>Miranda</em> interrogation, usually after arrestees have confessed, officers may then read the <em>Miranda</em> warnings and ask for a waiver.  If the arrestees waive their <em>Miranda</em> rights, officers will be able to repeat any <em>subse-quent</em> incriminating statements later in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Police Law Institute, Illinois Police Law Manual 83 (Jan. 2001\xe2\x80\x93Dec. 2003), http://www.illinoispolicelaw.org/training/lessons/\nILPLMIR.pdf (as visited Dec. 31, 2003, and available in the Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (hereinafter Police Law Manual) (emphasis in original).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The upshot of all this advice is a question-first practice of some popularity, as one can see from the reported cases describing its use, sometimes in obedience to departmental policy.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a confession so obtained is offered and challenged, attention must be paid to the conflicting objects of <em>Miranda</em> and question-first.  <em>Miranda</em> addressed \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogation practices \xe2\x80\xa6 likely \xe2\x80\xa6 to disable [an individual] from making a free and rational choice\xe2\x80\x9d about speaking, 384 U.

The object of question-first is to render <em>Miranda</em> warnings ineffective by waiting for a particularly opportune time to give them, after the suspect has already confessed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as \xe2\x80\x9cno talismanic incantation [is] required to satisfy [<em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s] strictures,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>California </em>v.<em> Prysock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/355/index.html">453 U. S. 355</a>, 359 (1981) <em>(per curiam),</em> it would be absurd to think that mere recitation of the litany suffices to satisfy <em>Miranda</em> in every conceivable circumstance.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \xe2\x80\x98conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by <em>Miranda</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duckworth </em>v.<em> Eagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/195/index.html">492 U. S. 195</a>, 203 (1989) (quoting <em>Prysock</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 361).  The threshold issue when interrogators question first and warn later is thus whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d as <em>Miranda</em> requires.  Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture?  Could they reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even if he had talked earlier?  For unless the warnings could place a suspect who has just been interrogated in a position to make such an informed choice, there is no practical justification for accepting the formal warnings as compliance with <em>Miranda</em>, or for treating the second stage of interrogation as distinct from the first, unwarned and inadmissible segment.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no doubt about the answer that proponents of question-first give to this question about the effectiveness of warnings given only after successful interrogation, and we think their answer is correct.  By any objective measure, applied to circumstances exemplified here, it is likely that if the interrogators employ the technique of withholding warnings until after interrogation succeeds in eliciting a confession, the warnings will be ineffective in preparing the suspect for successive interrogation, close in time and similar in content.  After all, the reason that question-first is catching on is as obvious as its manifest purpose, which is to get a confession the suspect would not make if he understood his rights at the outset; the sensible underlying assumption is that with one confession in hand before the warnings, the interrogator can count on getting its duplicate, with trifling additional trouble.  Upon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A more likely reaction on a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s part would be perplexity about the reason for discussing rights at that point, bewilderment being an unpromising frame of mind for knowledgeable decision.  What is worse, telling a suspect that \xe2\x80\x9canything you say can and will be used against you,\xe2\x80\x9d without expressly excepting the statement just given, could lead to an entirely reasonable inference that what he has just said will be used, with subsequent silence being of no avail.  Thus, when <em>Miranda</em> warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[e] a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moran </em>v.<em> Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 424 (1986).  By the same token, it would ordinarily be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated and proximately conducted questioning as independent interrogations subject to independent evaluation simply because <em>Miranda</em> warnings formally punctuate them in the middle.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Missouri argues that a confession repeated at the end of an interrogation sequence envisioned in a question-first strategy is admissible on the authority of <em>Oregon </em>v.<em> Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a> (1985), but the argument disfigures that case.  In <em>Elstad</em>, the police went to the young suspect\xe2\x80\x99s house to take him into custody on a charge of burglary.  Before the arrest, one officer spoke with the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s mother, while the other one joined the suspect in a \xe2\x80\x9cbrief stop in the living room,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 315, where the officer said he \xe2\x80\x9cfelt\xe2\x80\x9d the young man was involved in a burglary, <em>id.</em>, at 301 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The suspect acknowledged he had been at the scene.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This Court noted that the pause in the living room \xe2\x80\x9cwas not to interrogate the suspect but to notify his mother of the reason for his arrest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 315, and described the incident as having \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the earmarks of coercion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 316.  The Court, indeed, took care to mention that the officer\xe2\x80\x99s initial failure to warn was an \xe2\x80\x9coversight\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmay have been the result of confusion as to whether the brief exchange qualified as \xe2\x80\x98custodial interrogation\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\xa6 may simply have reflected \xe2\x80\xa6 reluctance to initiate an alarming police procedure before [an officer] had spoken with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 315\xe2\x80\x93316.  At the outset of a later and systematic station house interrogation going well beyond the scope of the laconic prior admission, the suspect was given <em>Miranda</em> warnings and made a full confession.  <em>Elstad, supra,</em> at 301, 314\xe2\x80\x93315.  In holding the second statement admissible and voluntary, <em>Elstad</em> rejected the \xe2\x80\x9ccat out of the bag\xe2\x80\x9d theory that any short, earlier admission, obtained in arguably innocent neglect of <em>Miranda</em>,<em> </em>determined the character of the later, warned confession, <em>Elstad</em>, 470 U. S., at 311\xe2\x80\x93314; on the facts of that case, the Court thought any causal connection between the first and second responses to the police was \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative and attenuated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 313.  Although the <em>Elstad</em> Court expressed no explicit conclusion about either officer\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, it is fair to read <em>Elstad</em> as treating the living room conversation as a good-faith <em>Miranda</em> mistake, not only open to correction by careful warnings before systematic questioning in that particular case, but posing no threat to warn-first practice generally.  See <em>Elstad</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 309 (characterizing the officers\xe2\x80\x99 omission of <em>Miranda</em> warnings as \xe2\x80\x9ca simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exercise his free will\xe2\x80\x9d); 470 U.

In <em>Elstad</em>, it was not unreasonable to see the occasion for questioning at the station house as presenting a markedly different experience from the short conversation at home; since a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s shoes could have seen the station house questioning as a new and distinct experience, the <em>Miranda</em> warnings could have made sense as presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up on the earlier admission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the opposite extreme are the facts here, which by any objective measure reveal a police strategy adapted to undermine the <em>Miranda</em> warnings.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The unwarned interrogation was conducted in the station house, and the questioning was systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill.  When the police were finished there was little, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid.  The warned phase of questioning proceeded after a pause of only 15 to 20 minutes, in the same place as the unwarned segment.  When the same officer who had conducted the first phase recited the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, he said nothing to counter the probable misimpression that the advice that anything Seibert said could be used against her also applied to the details of the inculpatory statement previously elicited.  In particular, the police did not advise that her prior statement could not be used.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Nothing was said or done to dispel the oddity of warning about legal rights to silence and counsel right after the police had led her through a systematic interrogation, and any uncertainty on her part about a right to stop talking about matters previously discussed would only have been aggravated by the way Officer Hanrahan set the scene by saying \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking for a little while about what happened on Wednesday the twelfth, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 66.  The impression that the further questioning was a mere continuation of the earlier questions and responses was fostered by references back to the confession already given.  It would have been reasonable to regard the two sessions as parts of a continuum, in which it would have been unnatural to refuse to repeat at the second stage what had been said before.  These circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the <em>Miranda</em> warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of <em>Miranda</em> cannot accomplish by training instructions what <em>Dickerson</em> held Congress could not do by statute.  Because the question-first tactic effectively threatens to thwart <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of reducing the risk that a coerced confession would be admitted, and because the facts here do not reasonably support a conclusion that the warnings given could have served their purpose, Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s postwarning statements are inadmissible.

In a sequential confession case, clarity is served if the later confession is approached by asking whether in the circumstances the <em>Miranda</em> warnings given could reasonably be found effective.  If yes, a court can take up the standard issues of voluntary waiver and voluntary statement; if no, the subsequent statement is inadmissible for want of adequate <em>Miranda</em> warnings, because the earlier and later statements are realistically seen as parts of a single, unwarned sequence of questioning.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It bears emphasizing that the effectiveness <em>Miranda</em> assumes the warnings can have must potentially extend through the repeated interrogation, since a suspect has a right to stop at any time.  It seems highly unlikely that a suspect could retain any such understanding when the interrogator leads him a second time through a line of questioning the suspect has already answered fully.  The point is not that a later unknowing or involuntary confession cancels out an earlier, adequate warning; the point is that the warning is unlikely to be effective in the question-first sequence we have described.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because the intent of the officer will rarely be as candidly admitted as it was here (even as it is likely to determine the conduct of the interrogation), the focus is on facts apart from intent that show the question-first tactic at work.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not hold that a formal addendum warning that a previous statement could not be used would be sufficient to change the character of the question-first procedure to the point of rendering an ensuing statement admissible, but its absence is clearly a factor that blunts\nthe efficacy of the warnings and points to a continuing, not a new, interrogation.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because we find that the warnings were inadequate, there is no need to assess the actual voluntariness of the statement.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961598">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nMISSOURI V.

Cf. <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, 309, 318, n. 5 (1985);<em> United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984).  I believe this is a sound and workable approach to the problem this case presents.  Prosecutors and judges have long understood how to apply the \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which they use in other areas of law.  See <em>Wong Sun</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/index.html">371 U. S. 471</a> (1963).<em> </em>And in the workaday world of criminal law enforcement the administrative simplicity of the familiar has significant advantages over a more complex exclusionary rule.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I believe the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach in practice will function as a \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d test.  The truly \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miranda </em>warnings on which the plurality insists, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, will occur only when certain circumstances\xe2\x80\x94a lapse in time, a change in location or interrogating officer, or a shift in the focus of the questioning\xe2\x80\x94intervene between the unwarned questioning and any postwarning statement.  Cf. <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/687/index.html">457 U.

S. 436</a> (1966).  It undermines the <em>Miranda</em> warning and obscures its meaning.  The plurality opinion is correct to conclude that statements obtained through the use of this technique are inadmissible.  Although I agree with much in the careful and convincing opinion for the plurality, my approach does differ in some respects, requiring this separate statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Miranda</em> rule has become an important and accepted element of the criminal justice system.  See <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a> (2000).  At the same time, not every violation of the rule requires suppression of the evidence obtained.  Evidence is admissible when the central concerns of <em>Miranda</em> are not likely to be implicated and when other objectives of the criminal justice system are best served by its introduction.  Thus, we have held that statements obtained in violation of the rule can be used for impeachment, so that the truth finding function of the trial is not distorted by the defense, see <em>Harris</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/index.html">401 U. S. 222</a> (1971); that there is an exception to protect countervailing concerns of public safety, see <em>New York</em> v. <em>Quarles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a> (1984); and that physical evidence obtained in reliance on statements taken in violation of the rule is admissible, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Patane</em>, <em>post,</em> p. ____.  These cases, in my view, are correct.  They recognize that admission of evidence is proper when it would further important objectives without compromising <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central concerns.  Under these precedents, the scope of the <em>Miranda</em> suppression remedy depends on a consideration of those legitimate interests and on whether admission of the evidence under the circumstances would frustrate <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central concerns and objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Oregon </em>v.<em> Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a> (1985), reflects this approach.  In <em>Elstad</em>, a suspect made an initial incriminating statement at his home.  The suspect had not received a <em>Miranda</em> warning before making the statement, apparently because it was not clear whether the suspect was in custody at the time.  The suspect was taken to the station house, where he received a proper warning, waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights, and made a second statement.  He later argued that the postwarning statement should be suppressed because it was related to the unwarned first statement, and likely induced or caused by it.  The Court held that, although a <em>Miranda</em> violation made the first statement inadmissible, the postwarning statements could be introduced against the accused because \xe2\x80\x9cneither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence would be served by suppression\xe2\x80\x9d given the facts of that case.  <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 308 (citing <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Tucker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/index.html">417 U. S. 433</a>, 445 (1974)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, <em>Elstad</em> was correct in its reasoning and its result.  <em>Elstad</em> reflects a balanced and pragmatic approach to enforcement of the <em>Miranda</em> warning.  An officer may not realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are required.  The officer may not plan to question the suspect or may be waiting for a more appropriate time.  Skilled investigators often interview suspects multiple times, and good police work may involve referring to prior statements to test their veracity or to refresh recollection.  In light of these realities it would be extravagant to treat the presence of one statement that cannot be admitted under <em>Miranda</em> as sufficient reason to prohibit subsequent statements preceded by a proper warning.  See <em>Elstad</em>, 470 U. S., at 309 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda</em> to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings \xe2\x80\xa6 so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period\xe2\x80\x9d).  That approach would serve \xe2\x80\x9cneither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence would be served by suppression of the \xe2\x80\xa6 testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 308.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case presents different considerations.  The police used a two-step questioning technique based on a deliberate violation of <em>Miranda</em>.  The <em>Miranda</em> warning was withheld to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the admonition when finally given.  As Justice Souter points out, the two-step technique permits the accused to conclude that the right not to respond did not exist when the earlier incriminating statements were made.  The strategy is based on the assumption that <em>Miranda</em> warnings will tend to mean less when recited midinterrogation, after inculpatory statements have already been obtained.  This tactic relies on an intentional misrepresentation of the protection that <em>Miranda</em> offers and does not serve any legitimate objectives that might otherwise justify its use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the interrogating officer here relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prewarning statement to obtain the postwarning statement used against her at trial.  The postwarning interview resembled a cross-examination.  The officer confronted the defendant with her inadmissible prewarning statements and pushed her to acknowledge them.  See App. 70 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99Trice, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that he was supposed to die in his sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d).  This shows the temptations for abuse inherent in the two-step technique.  Reference to the prewarning statement was an implicit suggestion that the mere repetition of the earlier statement was not independently incriminating.  The implicit suggestion was false.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The technique used in this case distorts the meaning of <em>Miranda</em> and furthers no legitimate countervailing interest.  The <em>Miranda</em> rule would be frustrated were we to allow police to undermine its meaning and effect.  The technique simply creates too high a risk that postwarning statements will be obtained when a suspect was deprived of \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 423\xe2\x80\x93424 (1986).  When an interrogator uses this deliberate, two-step strategy, predicated upon violating <em>Miranda</em> during an extended interview, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded absent specific, curative steps.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality concludes that whenever a two-stage interview occurs, admissibility of the postwarning statement should depend on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the <em>Miranda</em> warnings delivered midstream could have been effective enough to accomplish their object\xe2\x80\x9d given the specific facts of the case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  This test envisions an objective inquiry from the perspective of the suspect, and applies in the case of both intentional and unintentional two-stage interrogations.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  In my view, this test cuts too broadly.  <em>Miranda\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>clarity is one of its strengths, and a multifactor test that applies to every two-stage interrogation may serve to undermine that clarity.  Cf. <em>Berkemer</em> v. <em>McCarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U. S. 420</a>, 430 (1984).  I would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda</em> warning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of <em>Elstad</em> unless the deliberate two-step strategy was employed.  If the deliberate two-step strategy has been used, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.  Curative measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda</em> warning and of the <em>Miranda</em> waiver.  For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the <em>Miranda</em> warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn.  Cf. <em>Westover</em> v. <em>United States</em>, decided with <em>Miranda </em>v.<em> Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966).  Alternatively, an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement may be sufficient.  No curative steps were taken in this case, however, so the postwarning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961599">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nO\'CONNOR, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nMISSOURI V.

Consistent with that view, the Court today refuses to apply the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d analysis to the physical fruit of a claimed <em>Miranda</em> violation.  <em>Patane</em>, <em>post, </em>p.\xc2\xa0___.  The plurality correctly refuses to apply a similar analysis to testimonial fruits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the analysis the plurality ultimately espouses examines the same facts and circumstances that a \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d analysis would consider (such as the lapse of time between the two interrogations and change of questioner or location), it does so for entirely different reasons.  The fruits analysis would examine those factors because they are relevant to the balance of deterrence value versus the \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic and socially costly course\xe2\x80\x9d of excluding reliable evidence.  <em>Nix</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/431/index.html">467 U. S. 431</a>, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (1984).  The plurality, by contrast, looks to those factors to inform the <em>psychological </em>judgment regarding whether the suspect has been informed effectively of her right to remain silent.  The analytical underpinnings of the two approaches are thus entirely distinct, and they should not be conflated just because they function similarly in practice.  Cf. <em>ante,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of an intent-based test is also, in my view, correct.  Freedom from compulsion lies at the heart of the Fifth Amendment, and requires us to assess whether a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s decision to speak truly was voluntary.  Because voluntariness is a matter of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, we focus our analysis on the way in which suspects experience interrogation.  See generally <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 455 (summarizing psychological tactics used by police that \xe2\x80\x9cundermin[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwill to resist,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe very fact of custodial interrogation \xe2\x80\xa6 trades on the weakness of individuals\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 467 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\xe2\x80\x99s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thoughts kept inside a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s head cannot affect that experience.  See <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 422 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>Moran</em>, an attorney hired by the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s sister had been trying to contact the suspect and was told by the police, falsely, that they would not begin an interrogation that night.  <em>Id.,</em> at 416\xe2\x80\x93418.  The suspect was not aware that an attorney had been hired for him.  <em>Id.,</em> at 417.  We rejected an analysis under which a different result would obtain for \xe2\x80\x9cthe same defendant, armed with the same information and confronted with precisely the same police conduct\xe2\x80\x9d if something not known to the defendant\xe2\x80\x94such as the fact that an attorney was attempting to contact him\xe2\x80\x94had been different.  <em>Id.,</em> at 422.  The same principle applies here.  A suspect who experienced the exact same interrogation as Seibert, save for a difference in the undivulged, subjective intent of the interrogating officer when he failed to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings, would not experience the interrogation any differently.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether intentional or inadvertent, the state of mind of the police is irrelevant to the question of the intelligence and voluntariness of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s election to abandon his rights.  Although highly inappropriate, even deliberate deception of an attorney could not possibly affect a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s decision to waive his <em>Miranda</em> rights unless he were at least aware of the incident.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 423.  Cf. <em>Stansbury</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/318/index.html">511 U.

Moreover, recognizing an exception to <em>Elstad</em> for intentional violations would require focusing constitutional analysis on a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent, an unattractive proposition that we all but uniformly avoid.  In general, \xe2\x80\x9cwe believe that \xe2\x80\x98sending state and federal courts on an expedition into the minds of police officers would produce a grave and fruitless misallocation of judicial resources.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U.

S. 560</a>, 565 (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em> (White, J., dissenting)).  This case presents the uncommonly straightforward circumstance of an officer openly admitting that the violation was intentional.  But the inquiry will be complicated in other situations probably more likely to occur.  For example, different officers involved in an interrogation might claim different states of mind regarding the failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  Even in the simple case of a single officer who claims that a failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings was inadvertent, the likelihood of error will be high.  See W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa71.4(e), p.\xc2\xa0124 (3d ed. 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no reason to believe that courts can with any degree of success determine in which instances the police had an ulterior motive\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These evidentiary difficulties have led us to reject an intent-based test in several criminal procedure contexts.

S. 649</a> (1984), one of the factors that led us to reject an inquiry into the subjective intent of the police officer in crafting a test for the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic safety\xe2\x80\x9d exception to <em>Miranda</em> was that officers\xe2\x80\x99 motives will be \xe2\x80\x9clargely unverifiable.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 656.  Similarly, our opinion in <em>Whren</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a>, 813\xe2\x80\x93814 (1996), made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidentiary difficulty of establishing subjective intent\xe2\x80\x9d was one of the reasons (albeit not the principal one) for refusing to consider intent in Fourth Amendment challenges generally.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I believe that the approach espoused by Justice Kennedy is ill advised.  Justice Kennedy would extend <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exclusionary rule to any case in which the use of the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-step interrogation technique\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccalculated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion concurring in judgment).  This approach untethers the analysis from facts knowable to, and therefore having any potential directly to affect, the suspect.  Far from promoting \xe2\x80\x9cclarity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the approach will add a third step to the suppression inquiry.  In virtually every two-stage interrogation case, in addition to addressing the standard <em>Miranda</em> and voluntariness questions, courts will be forced to conduct the kind of difficult, state-of-mind inquiry that we normally take pains to avoid.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to <em>Elstad</em>, and mine to the plurality, end there.  Our decision in <em>Elstad</em> rejected two lines of argument advanced in favor of suppression.  The first was based on the \xe2\x80\x9cfruit of the poisonous tree\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, discussed above.  The second was the argument that the \xe2\x80\x9clingering compulsion\xe2\x80\x9d inherent in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s having let the \xe2\x80\x9ccat out of the bag\xe2\x80\x9d required suppression.  470 U. S., at 311.  The Court of Appeals of Oregon, in accepting the latter argument, had endorsed a theory indistinguishable from the one today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality adopts:  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he coercive impact of the unconstitutionally obtained statement remains, because in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mind it has sealed his fate.  It is this impact that must be dissipated in order to make a subsequent confession admissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  61 Ore. App. 673, 677, 658 P.\xc2\xa02d 552, 554 (1983).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We rejected this theory outright.  We did so not because we refused to recognize the \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological impact of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that he has let the cat out of the bag,\xe2\x80\x9d but because we refused to \xe2\x80\x9cendo[w]\xe2\x80\x9d those \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological effects\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional implications.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U. S., at 311.  To do so, we said, would \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively immuniz[e] a suspect who responds to pre-<em>Miranda</em> warning questions from the consequences of his subsequent informed waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d an immunity that \xe2\x80\x9ccomes at a high cost to legitimate law enforcement activity, while adding little desirable protection to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s interest in not being <em>compelled</em> to testify against himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 312.  The plurality might very well think that we struck the balance between Fifth Amendment rights and law enforcement interests incorrectly in <em>Elstad;</em> but that is not normally a sufficient reason for ignoring the dictates of <em>stare decisis</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would analyze the two-step interrogation procedure under the voluntariness standards central to the Fifth Amendment and reiterated in <em>Elstad</em>.  <em>Elstad </em>commands that if Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s first statement is shown to have been involuntary, the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time or a change in circumstances: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a prior statement is actually coerced, the time that passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in identity of the interrogators all bear on whether that coercion has carried over into the second confession.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U. S., at 310 (citing <em>Westover </em>v. <em>United States</em>, decided with <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 494).  In addition, Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s second statement should be suppressed if she showed that it was involuntary despite the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.  <em>Elstad</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made.  As in any such inquiry, the finder of fact must examine the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect in evaluating the voluntariness of his statements\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although I would leave this analysis for the Missouri courts to conduct on remand, I note that, unlike the officers in <em>Elstad</em>, Officer Hanrahan referred to Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned statement during the second part of the interrogation when she made a statement at odds with her unwarned confession.  App. 70 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99Trice, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that he was supposed to die in his sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d); cf<em>. Elstad</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 316 (officers did not \xe2\x80\x9cexploit the unwarned admission to pressure respondent into waiving his right to remain silent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such a tactic may bear on the voluntariness inquiry.  Cf. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/index.html">394 U. S. 731</a>, 739 (1969) (fact that police had falsely told a suspect that his accomplice had already confessed was \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d to the voluntariness inquiry); <em>Moran</em>, 475 U. S., at 423\xe2\x80\x93424 (in discussing police deception, stating that simply withholding information is \xe2\x80\x9crelevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Miranda</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 476.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I believe that the plurality gives insufficient deference to <em>Elstad</em> and that Justice Kennedy places improper weight on subjective intent, I respectfully\ndissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
