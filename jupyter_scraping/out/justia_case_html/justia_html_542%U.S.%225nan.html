Argued April 26, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 21, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Five days before the 1-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would have run, respondent filed two <em>pro se</em> \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d federal habeas petitions\xe2\x80\x94those containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims\xe2\x80\x94and motions to stay the petitions while he returned to state court to exhaust the unexhausted claims.  The Magistrate Judge gave him three options:\xc2\xa0(1) The petitions could be dismissed without prejudice and respondent could refile after exhausting the unexhausted claims; (2) the unexhausted claims could be dismissed and he could proceed with only the exhausted claims; or (3) he could contest the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that some claims were unexhausted.  He chose the first option with respect to one petition and failed to respond with respect to the other.  The Federal District Court dismissed his petitions without prejudice.  He then filed habeas petitions in the California Supreme Court, which were both denied.  The federal court dismissed his subsequently refiled <em>pro se</em> habeas petitions with prejudice as untimely under AEDPA, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), and denied him a certificate of appealability (COA).  The Ninth Circuit granted a COA, concluding that his initial petitions were timely under \xc2\xa72254(d) and that his later petitions related back to the initial ones.  The Ninth Circuit determined that although the District Court correctly concluded that it did not have discretion to stay respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mixed petitions, it could have acted on his stay motions had he chosen the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s second option and then renewed the prematurely filed stay motions.  It also held that the District Court had to give respondent two specific warnings: first, that it could not consider his motions to stay the mixed petitions unless he chose to amend them and dismiss the then-unexhausted claims; and second, if applicable, that his federal claims would be time barred, absent cause for equitable tolling, upon his return to federal court if he opted to dismiss the petitions without prejudice and return to state court to exhaust all his claims.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The District Court was not required to provide the warnings directed by the Ninth Circuit.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Federal district courts must dismiss \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d habeas petitions.  <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a>, 522.  The combined effect of <em>Rose</em> and AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is that if a petitioner comes to federal court with a mixed petition toward the end of the limitations period, a dismissal of his mixed petition could result in the loss of all his claims\xe2\x80\x94including those already exhausted\xe2\x80\x94because the limitations period could expire during the time he returns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims.  To address this, the Ninth Circuit allows a district court to employ a stay-and-abeyance procedure, which involves (1) dismissal of any unexhausted claims from the original mixed habeas petition; (2) a stay of the remaining claims, pending exhaustion of the dismissed unexhausted claims in state court; and (3) amendment of the original petition to add the newly exhausted claims that then relate back to the original petition.  Here, the Ninth Circuit held that if a <em>pro se</em> prisoner files a mixed petition, the district court must give two specific warnings regarding the stay-and-abeyance procedure.  But federal district judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to <em>pro se</em> litigants.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McKaskle</em> v. <em>Wiggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/168/index.html">465 U. S. 168</a>, 183\xe2\x80\x93184.  Explaining the details of federal habeas procedure and calculating statutes of limitations are tasks normally and properly performed by trained counsel.  Requiring district courts to advise <em>pro se</em> litigants in such a manner would undermine district judges\xe2\x80\x99 role as impartial decisionmakers.  And the warnings run the risk of being misleading.  The first could encourage the use of stay-and-abeyance when it is not in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.  The second would force upon judges the potentially burdensome task of making a case-specific calculation of whether the AEDPA limitations period has already run or will have run by the time the petitioner returns to federal court.  Because such calculations depend upon information contained in documents that do not necessarily accompany the petition, a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s calculation could be in error and thereby misinform a <em>pro se</em> petitioner.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Rose</em> requires that a prisoner be given \xe2\x80\x9cthe choice of returning to state court to exhaust his claims or amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d 455 U. S., at 510, is unavailing.  <em>Rose</em> requires only that a district court dismiss mixed petitions, which, as a practical matter, means that the prisoner must follow one of these two paths if he wants to proceed with his federal petition.  Nothing in <em>Rose</em> requires that both options be equally attractive, or that district judges give specific advisements as to the availability and wisdom of these options.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Castro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>540 U. S. ___, is misplaced, because <em>Castro</em> dealt with a district court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>sU. S.onte</em> recharacterization of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s pleading and did not address whether a district court is required to explain a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s options before a <em>voluntary</em> dismissal.

S. 509</a> (1982), federal district courts must dismiss \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d habeas corpus petitions\xe2\x80\x94those containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.  In this case, we decide whether the District Court erred by dismissing, pursuant to <em>Rose</em>, a <em>pro se</em> habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s two habeas petitions without giving him two particular advisements.  Because we hold that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide these warnings did not make the dismissals improper, we need not address the second question presented, whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent untimely petitions relate back to his \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d initial petitions.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 19, 1997, five days before his 1-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, would have run, respondent signed and delivered to prison authorities two <em>pro se</em> federal habeas corpus petitions.  The first petition related to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for, among other things, conspiring to murder John Loguercio and attempting to murder Loguercio\xe2\x80\x99s wife; the second related to his conviction for the first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Thomas Weed.  Because the petitions contained unexhausted claims, respondent also filed motions to stay the petitions so that he could return to state court to exhaust the unexhausted claims.  The Magistrate Judge gave respondent three options: (1) The petitions could be dismissed without prejudice and respondent could refile after exhausting the unexhausted claims; (2) the unexhausted claims could be dismissed and respondent could proceed with only the exhausted claims; or (3) respondent could contest the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that some of the claims had not been exhausted.  App. 51\xe2\x80\x9352; 81\xe2\x80\x9382.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to his petition in the Loguercio case, respondent chose the first option.  With respect to the Weed case, respondent failed to respond to the Magistrate Judge.  The District Court dismissed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petitions without prejudice.  In both cases, respondent proceeded by filing habeas corpus petitions in the California Supreme Court, which were both summarily denied.  Respondent subsequently refiled his <em>pro se</em> habeas petitions in Federal District Court.  The District Court, in both cases, dismissed the petitions with prejudice as untimely under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year statute of limitations, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), and denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motions for a certificate of appealability (COA).  The Ninth Circuit consolidated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motions for a COA, and then granted a COA on the question whether his federal habeas petitions were timely under \xc2\xa72254(d).  A divided panel concluded that both of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s initial federal habeas petitions were timely filed and held that his later petitions related back to the initial petitions.  <em>Ford</em> v. <em>Hubbard</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa03d 1086, 1097 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the District Court correctly concluded that it did not have discretion to stay respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mixed petitions, see <em>Rose</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 522, the Ninth Circuit determined that the District Court could have acted on the stay motions if respondent had chosen the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s second option\xe2\x80\x94dismissal of the unexhausted claims\xe2\x80\x94and then renewed the prematurely filed stay motions.  Under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, the District Court was obligated to advise respondent that it could consider his stay motions only if he chose this route.  330 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1099.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to inform respondent was, according to the Court of Appeals, prejudicial error because it deprived respondent of a \xe2\x80\x9cfair and informed opportunity to have his stay motions heard, to exhaust his unexhausted claims, and ultimately to have his claims considered on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1100.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court also committed prejudicial error, according to the Ninth Circuit, for failing to inform respondent that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year statute of limitations had run on both of his petitions and that, consequently, he would be barred from refiling his petitions in federal court if he failed to amend them or if he chose to dismiss the petitions without prejudice in order to exhaust the unexhausted claims.  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitively, although not intentionally,\xe2\x80\x9d misled respondent by telling him that if he chose the first option, the dismissal would be without<em> </em>prejudice.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court of Appeals concluded that respondent should have been told that, because AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations had run with respect to his claims, a dismissal without prejudice would effectively result in a dismissal with prejudice<em> </em>unless equitable tolling applied.  <em>Id</em>., at 1101.  According to the Court of Appeals, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s error in this regard deprived respondent of the opportunity to make a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful\xe2\x80\x9d choice between the two options.  <em>Id</em>., at 1102.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. ___ (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Rose</em>, federal district courts must dismiss mixed habeas petitions.  455 U. S., at 510, 522.  Subsequent to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Rose</em>, Congress enacted AEDPA, which imposed a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas corpus petition.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  The combined effect of <em>Rose</em> and AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is that if a petitioner comes to federal court with a mixed petition toward the end of the limitations period, a dismissal of his mixed petition could result in the loss of all of his claims\xe2\x80\x94including those already exhausted\xe2\x80\x94because the limitations period could expire during the time a petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims.  To address this, the Ninth Circuit has held that a district court may employ a stay-and-abeyance procedure.  See <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for the Northern Dist. of California ex rel. Taylor</em>, 134 F.\xc2\xa03d 981, 988 (1998).  The stay-and-abeyance procedure involves three steps: first, dismissal of any unexhausted claims from the original mixed habeas petition; second, a stay of the remaining claims, pending exhaustion of the dismissed unexhausted claims in state court; and third, amendment of the original petition to add the newly exhausted claims that then relate back to the original petition.  <em>Id</em>., at 986.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that if a <em>pro se</em> prisoner files a mixed petition, the district court must give two specific warnings regarding the stay-and-abeyance procedure: first, that \xe2\x80\x9cit would not have the power to consider [a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s] motions to stay the [mixed] petitions unless he opted to amend them and dismiss the then-unexhausted claims,\xe2\x80\x9d 330 F. 3d, at 1092\xe2\x80\x931093, and, second, if applicable, \xe2\x80\x9cthat [a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s] federal claims would be time-barred, absent cause for equitable tolling, upon his return to federal court if he opted to dismiss the petitions \xe2\x80\x98without prejudice\xe2\x80\x99 and return to state court to exhaust all of his claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1093.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without addressing the propriety of this stay-and-abeyance procedure, we hold that federal district judges are not required to give <em>pro se</em> litigants these two warnings.  District judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to <em>pro se </em>litigants.  In <em>McKaskle</em> v. <em>Wiggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/168/index.html">465 U. S. 168</a>, 183\xe2\x80\x93184 (1984), the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] defendant does not have a constitutional right to receive personal instruction from the trial judge on courtroom procedure\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution [does not] require judges to take over chores for a <em>pro se</em> defendant that would normally be attended to by trained counsel as a matter of course.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also <em>Martinez</em> v. <em>Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/152/index.html">528 U. S. 152</a>, 162 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he trial judge is under no duty to provide personal instruction on courtroom procedure or to perform any legal \xe2\x80\x98chores\xe2\x80\x99 for the defendant that counsel would normally carry out\xe2\x80\x9d).  Explaining the details of federal habeas procedure and calculating statutes of limitations are tasks normally and properly performed by trained counsel as a matter of course.  Requiring district courts to advise a <em>pro se</em> litigant in such a manner would undermine district judges\xe2\x80\x99 role as impartial decisionmakers.  And, to the extent that respondent is concerned with a district court\xe2\x80\x99s potential to mislead <em>pro se</em> habeas petitioners, the warnings respondent advocates run the risk of being misleading themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, the first warning could encourage the use of stay-and-abeyance when it is not in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s best interest to pursue such a course.  This could be the case, for example, where the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s unexhausted claims are particularly weak and petitioner would therefore be better off proceeding only with his exhausted claims.  And it is certainly the case that not every litigant seeks to maximize judicial process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second advisement would force upon district judges the potentially burdensome, time-consuming, and fact-intensive task of making a case-specific investigation and calculation of whether the AEDPA limitations period has already run or will have run by the time the petitioner returns to federal court.  As the dissent below recognized, district judges often will not be able to make these calculations based solely on the face of habeas petitions.  330 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108.  Such calculations depend upon information contained in documents that do not necessarily accompany the petitions.  This is so because petitioners are not required by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 or the Rules Governing \xc2\xa72254 Cases to attach to their petitions, or to file separately, state-court records.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See 1 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa715.2c, p. 711 (4th ed. 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cMost petitioners do not have the ability to submit the record with the petition, and the statute and rules relieve them of any obligation to do so and require the state to furnish the record with the answer\xe2\x80\x9d).  District judges, thus, might err in their calculation of the statute of limitations and affirmatively misinform <em>pro se</em> petitioners of their options.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent nevertheless argues that the advisements are necessary to ensure that <em>pro se </em>petitioners make informed decisions and do not unknowingly forfeit rights.  Brief for Respondent 27\xe2\x80\x9332.  Respondent reads <em>Rose</em> as mandating that \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner be given \xe2\x80\x98<em>the choice </em>of returning to state court to exhaust his claims or amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25\xe2\x80\x9326, 27 (quoting <em>Rose</em>, 455 U. S., at 510) (emphasis in brief).  But <em>Rose</em> requires only that \xe2\x80\x9ca district court must dismiss \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98mixed petitions,\xe2\x80\x99 leaving the prisoner<em> </em>with<em> </em>the<em> </em>choice\xe2\x80\x9d described above.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In other words, <em>Rose</em> requires dismissal of mixed petitions, which, as a practical matter, means that the prisoner must follow one of the two paths outlined in <em>Rose</em> if he wants to proceed with his federal habeas petition.  But nothing in <em>Rose</em> requires that both of these options be equally attractive, much less suggests that district judges give specific advisements as to the availability and wisdom of these options.  As such, any advisement of this additional option would not \xe2\x80\x9csimply implement what this Court <em>already</em> requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 27 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent also relies heavily upon <em>Castro</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 540 U. S. ___ (2003).  In <em>Castro</em>, we held that a federal district court cannot <em>sU. S.onte </em>recharacterize a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a first \xc2\xa72255 motion unless it informs the litigant of the consequences of the recharacterization, thereby giving the litigant the opportunity to contest the recharacterization, or to withdraw or amend the motion.  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  <em>Castro</em> dealt with a District Court, of its own volition, taking away a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s desired route\xe2\x80\x94namely, a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 motion\xe2\x80\x94and transforming it, against his will, into a \xc2\xa72255 motion.  Cf. <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cRecharacterization \xe2\x80\xa6 requires a court deliberately to override the <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s choice of procedural vehicle for his claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  We recognized that although this practice is often used to help <em>pro se</em> petitioners, it could also harm them.  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  Because of these competing considerations, we reasoned that the warning would \xe2\x80\x9chelp the <em>pro se </em>litigant understand \xe2\x80\xa6 whether he should withdraw or amend his motion [and] whether he should <em>contest</em> the recharacterization,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (emphasis in original).  <em>Castro</em>, then, did not address the question whether a district court is required to explain to a <em>pro se </em>litigant his options before a <em>voluntary </em>dismissal and its reasoning sheds no light on the question we confront.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Therefore, we hold that district courts are not required to give the particular advisements required by the Ninth Circuit before dismissing a <em>pro se</em> petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mixed habeas petition under <em>Rose</em>.

That procedure would have permitted Richard Ford, the respondent, to ask the federal court to stay proceedings and hold his federal habeas petition (in abeyance) on its docket while he returned to state court to exhaust his unexhausted federal claims.  Thus Ford would not have had to bring his federal petition again, after expiration of the 1-year limitations period.  California\xe2\x80\x99s courts thereby could have considered his unexhausted claims without forcing him to forfeit his right to ask a federal court for habeas relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What could be unlawful about this procedure?  In <em>Rose </em>v.<em> Lundy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a> (1982), the Court, pointing to considerations of comity, held that federal habeas courts must give state courts a first crack at deciding an issue.  <em>Id</em>., at 518\xe2\x80\x93519.  It prohibited the federal courts from considering unexhausted claims.  The Court added that, where a habeas petition is \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d (containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims), the federal habeas court should dismiss the petition.  <em>Id</em>., at 520.  <em>Rose </em>reassured those prisoners (typically acting <em>pro se</em>), however, that the dismissal would not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably impair the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s right to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 522.  That reassurance made sense at that time because the law did not then put a time limit on refiling.  It thereby permitted a prisoner to return to federal court after he had exhausted his state remedies.  <em>Id</em>., at 520.  Of course, the law prohibits a prisoner from \xe2\x80\x9cabusing the writ,\xe2\x80\x9d but ordinarily a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of his mixed petition, his presenting unexhausted claims to the state courts, and his subsequent return to federal court would not have constituted an abuse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourteen years after <em>Rose,</em> Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  AEDPA imposed a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a habeas petition.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  One might have thought at first blush that the 1-year limitations period would not make much practical difference where an exhaustion-based dismissal of a mixed petition was at issue, for AEDPA tolls the limitations period while \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review . . . is pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  In <em>Duncan </em>v.<em> Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 181\xe2\x80\x93182 (2001), however, this Court held that the words \xe2\x80\x9cother collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d do not cover a federal habeas proceeding.  And that fact means that a <em>pro se </em>habeas petitioner who mistakenly files a mixed petition in federal court may well find that he has no time to get to state court and back before his year expires.  Hence, after <em>Duncan</em>, the dismissal of such a petition will not simply give state courts a chance to consider the unexhausted issues he raises; it often also means the permanent end of <em>any</em> federal habeas review.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4; see also <em>Duncan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 186, 191 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing statistics that 93% of habeas petitioners are <em>pro se;</em> 63% of all habeas petitions are dismissed; 57% of those are dismissed for failure to exhaust; and district courts took an average of nearly nine months to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds).  Indeed, in this very case\xe2\x80\x94a not atypical scenario\xe2\x80\x94the limitations period expired while the petition was pending before the District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I dissented in <em>Duncan, </em>arguing<em> </em>that Congress could not have intended to cause prisoners to lose their habeas rights under these circumstances.<em> </em>533 U. S., at 190.  Although the majority reached a different conclusion, it did so primarily upon the basis of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.  See <em>id</em>., at 172\xe2\x80\x93178.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accepting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view of that language, I nonetheless believe that the other considerations that I raised in <em>Duncan </em>support the lawfulness of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s stay-and-abeyance procedure.  That procedure recognizes the comity interests that <em>Rose</em> identified, and it reconciles those interests with the longstanding constitutional interest in making habeas corpus available to state prisoners.  There is no tension between the two.  It is thus not surprising that nearly every circuit has adopted a similar procedure.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Crews </em>v.<em> Horn</em>, 360 F.\xc2\xa03d 146, 152 (CA3 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[V]irtually every other Circuit that has considered this issue has held that, following AEDPA, while it usually is within a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to determine whether to stay or dismiss a mixed petition, staying the petition is the only appropriate course of action where an outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Nowaczyk </em>v.<em> Warden</em>, 299 F.\xc2\xa03d 69, 79 (CA1 2002); <em>Palmer </em>v.<em> Carlton</em>, 276 F.\xc2\xa03d 777, 781 (CA6 2002); <em>Zarvela </em>v.<em> Artuz</em>, 254 F.\xc2\xa03d 374, 381 (CA2 2001); <em>Freeman </em>v.<em> Page</em>, 208 F.\xc2\xa03d 572, 577 (CA7 2000); <em>Brewer </em>v.<em> Johnson</em>, 139 F.\xc2\xa03d 491, 493 (CA5 1998); cf. <em>Mackall </em>v.<em> Angelone</em>, 131 F.\xc2\xa03d 442, 445 (CA4 1997); but cf. <em>Akins </em>v.<em> Kenney</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 681, 685\xe2\x80\x93686 (CA8 2003) (refusing to stay <em>mixed</em> petitions).  See also <em>Duncan</em>, 533 U. S., at 182\xe2\x80\x93183 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 192 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cJustice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 sound suggestions that district courts hold mixed petition in abeyance\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that the <em>Duncan </em>majority also noted the importance of respecting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s goals of \xe2\x80\x9ccomity, finality, and federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But I do not see how the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s procedure could significantly undermine those goals.  It is unlikely to mean that prisoners will increasingly file mixed petitions.  A petitioner who believes that he is wrongly incarcerated would not deliberately file a petition with unexhausted claims in the wrong (<em>i.e</em>., federal) court, for that error would simply prolong proceedings.  Those under a sentence of death might welcome delays, but in such cases deliberate misfiling would risk a finding that the filer has abused the writ and a consequent judicial refusal to hold the petition in abeyance.  Moreover, a habeas court may fashion a stay to prevent abusive delays; for example, by providing a time limit within which a prisoner must exhaust state-court remedies.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Zarvela, supra</em>, at 381.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the Ninth Circuit procedure seriously undermine AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period.  That provision requires a prisoner to file a federal habeas petition with at least one exhausted claim within the 1-year period, and it prohibits the habeas petitioner from subsequently including any new claim.  These requirements remain.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the importance of maintaining a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s access to a federal habeas court and the comparatively minor interference that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s procedure creates with comity or other AEDPA concerns, I would find use of the stay-and-abeyance procedure legally permissible.  I also believe that the Magistrate Judge should have informed Ford of this important rights-preserving option.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961645">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n542 U.

But that unaddressed issue seems to me pivotal.  If the stay and abeyance procedure was a choice respondent could have made, then the Magistrate Judge erred in failing to inform respondent of that option.  While I do not suggest that clear statement of the options available to respondent must be augmented by \xe2\x80\x9cadvisements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, I would not defer, as the Court does, the question at the core of this case.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, as this Court recognizes, <em>ante</em>, at 1, respondent filed his habeas petitions \xe2\x80\x9cfive days before [the termination of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s] 1-year statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, any new petition by respondent would have been time barred even before the Magistrate Judge dismissed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s original petitions.
