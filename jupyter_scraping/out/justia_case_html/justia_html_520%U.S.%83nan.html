They argue that they raised their federal due process claim in their initial brief before the Alabama Supreme Court, and point to two pages of that brief discussing <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Ticor, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/982/386/">982 F.2d 386</a> (CA9 1992), cert. dism\'d as improvidently granted, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/117/case.html">511 U.

Although <i>Ticor </i>is relevant to the federal claim they present here, see 982 F. 2d, at 392, they mentioned the case below in the context of an entirely different argument that the right to a jury trial under \xc2\xa7 11 of the Alabama Constitution gives a plaintiff the right to opt out of a class-action settlement agreement. The discussion of "a federal case, in the midst of an unrelated argument, is insufficient to inform a state court that it has been presented with a claim." <i>Board of Directors of Rotary Int\'l, supra, </i>at 550, n. 9.</p><p>Equally unavailing is petitioners\' reliance on three other pages of their Alabama Supreme Court brief. Although that portion begins with a heading asserting that "[m]inimum due process requires that Class Members be given the right to opt out or exclude themselves from the class," see Brief for Appellants in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct.

Reply Brief for Appellants in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct. Ala.), pp. 1-5. In these circumstances, it would have been perfectly reasonable for a state court to conclude that the broader federal claim was not before it.3</p><p>2 Respondent Robertson listed among issues presented for review:</p><p>"Whether an opt-out provision is required by the due process [clause] and/ or trial by jury guarantees of the U.

This general citation fails to comply with our requirement that petitioners provide us with <i>"specific </i>reference to the places in the record where the matter appears," see this Court\'s Rule 14.1(g)(i) (emphasis added). Moreover, the passing invocations of "due process" we found therein, see App. 196, 209, 226-227, fail to cite the Federal Constitution or any cases relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, but could have just as easily referred to the due process guarantee of the Alabama Constitution, see Ala. Const., \xc2\xa7 13 (1901), and thus they did not meet our minimal requirement that it must be clear that a <i>federal </i>claim was presented, <i>Webb </i>v. <i>Webb, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/493/case.html">451 U.

While the claim presented there closely resembles the one they ask us to review, see Appellants\' Application for Rehearing and Brief in Support of Application for Rehearing in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct. Ala.), pp. 7-12, we have generally refused to consider issues raised clearly for the first time in a petition for rehearing when the state court is silent on the question, see <i>Board of Directors of Rotary Int\'l </i>v. <i>Rotary Club of Duarte, </i>481 U.

S., at 533; <i>Bankers Life </i>&amp; <i>Casualty Co., </i>486 U. S., at 79; <i>Gates, </i>462 U.

As we have explained, "it would be unseemly in our dual system of government" to disturb the finality of state judgments on a federal ground that the state court did not have occasion to consider. <i>Webb, </i>451 U. S., at 500 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the rule affords state courts "an opportunity to consider the constitutionality of the actions of state officials, and, equally important, proposed changes" that could obviate any challenges to state action in federal court. <i>Gates, supra, </i>at 221-222. Here, the Alabama Supreme Court has an undeniable interest in having the opportunity to determine in the first instance whether its existing rules governing class-action settlements satisfy the requirements of due process, and whether to exercise its power to amend those rules to avoid potential constitutional challenges, see Ala. Const., \xc2\xa7 6.11; 1971 Ala. Acts No. 1311.</p><p>Our traditional standard also reflects "practical considerations" relating to this Court\'s capacity to decide issues. <i>Bankers Life </i>&amp; <i>Casualty Co., supra, </i>at 79.

See <i>Webb, supra, </i>at 500. Here, even if the state court\'s construction of its class-action rules would not obviate the due process challenge, it would undoubtedly aid our understanding of those rules as a predicate to our assessment of their constitutional adequacy. And not incidentally, the parties would enjoy the opportunity to test and refine their positions before reaching this Court.</p><p>The only unusual consideration weighing in favor of reaching the question presented is that respondents failed to raise a timely objection to our granting the petition for certiorari, on the ground that the question presented in that petition had not been properly raised or addressed.4 This Court\'s Rule 15.2 "admonishe[s counsel] that they have an obligation to the Court to point out in the brief in opposition, and not later, any perceived misstatement" "of fact or law in the petition that bears on what issues properly would be before the Court if certiorari were granted."

Even if, contrary to the assumption underlying our discussion in the main text, the requirement that claims be raised in or addressed by the state court is jurisdictional and cannot be waived, counsel are obliged to this Court (not to mention their clients) to raise such threshold issues in their briefs in opposition.</p><p>Nor is respondents\' failure to object in accordance with Rule 15.2 excused by petitioners\' failure to comply with this Court\'s Rule 14.1(g)(i), which requires a petitioner seeking review of a state-court judgment to specify, among other things, "when the federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised" in the state court system and "the method or manner of raising them and the way in which they were passed on by those courts, ... so as to show that the federal question was timely and properly raised and that this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment on a writ of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="92">92</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>the failure of counsel to comply with Rule 15.2 that overrides the interest of comity or the value to this Court of a fully developed factual and legal record upon which to base decisions.6</p><p>Accordingly, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>certiorari."
