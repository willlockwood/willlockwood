JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Once again, we are called upon to decide whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one.  During this Term alone, we have been asked to undertake this task no fewer than five times in cases in which we have granted certiorari. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Here we decide whether customers of securities brokerage firms that are required to file certain financial reports with regulatory authorities by \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), 48 Stat. 897, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78q(a), have an implied cause of action for damages under \xc2\xa7 17(a) against accountants who audit such reports, based on misstatements contained in the reports. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="563">Page 442 U. S. 563</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Touche Ross &amp; Co. is a firm of certified public accountants.  Weis Securities, Inc. (Weis), a securities brokerage firm registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) and a member of the New York Stock Exchange (Exchange), retained Touche Ross to serve as Weis\' independent certified public accountant from 1969 to 1973.  In this capacity, Touche Ross conducted audits of Weis\' books and records and prepared for filing with the Commission the annual reports of financial condition required by \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78q(a), and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.17a-5 (1972). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Touche Ross also prepared for Weis </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 442 U. S. 564</a></p><p> responses to financial questionnaires required by the Exchange of its member firms.</p>\n<p>This case arises out of the insolvency and liquidation of Weis.  In 1973, the Commission and the Exchange learned of Weis\' precarious financial condition and of possible violations of the 1934 Act by Weis and its officers.  In May, 1973, the Commission sought and was granted an injunction barring Weis and five of its officers from conducting business in violation of the 1934 Act. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  At the same time, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), pursuant to statutory authority, applied in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for a decree adjudging that Weis\' customers were in need of the protection afforded by the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA), 84 Stat. 1636, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78aaa <em>et seq.</em> [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The District Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 442 U. S. 565</a></p><p> granted the requested decree and appointed respondent Redington (Trustee) to act as trustee in the liquidation of the Weis business under SIPA.</p>\n<p>During the liquidation, Weis\' cash and securities on hand appeared to be insufficient to make whole those customers who had left assets or deposits with Weis.  Accordingly, pursuant to SIPA, SIPC advanced the Trustee $14 million to satisfy, up to specified statutory limits, the claims of the approximately 34,000 Weis customers and certain other creditors of Weis.  Despite the advance of $14 million by SIPC, there apparently remain several million dollars of unsatisfied customer claims. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1976, SIPC and the Trustee filed this action for damages against Touche Ross in the District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The "common allegations" of the complaint, which at this stage of the case we must accept as true, aver that certain of Weis\' officers conspired to conceal substantial operating losses during its 1972 fiscal year by falsifying financial reports required to be filed with regulatory authorities pursuant to \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the 1934 Act.   App. 8.  SIPC and the Trustee seek to impose liability upon Touche Ross by reason of its allegedly improper audit and certification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 442 U. S. 566</a></p><p> of the 1972 Weis financial statements and preparation of answers to the Exchange financial questionnaire.  <em>Id.</em> at 15-19.  The complaint alleges that, because of its improper conduct, Touche Ross breached duties that it owed SIPC, the Trustee, and others under the common law, \xc2\xa7 17(a) and the regulations thereunder, and that Touche Ross\' alleged dereliction prevented Weis\' true financial condition from becoming known until it was too late to take remedial action to forestall liquidation or to lessen the adverse financial consequences of such a liquidation to the Weis customers.  App. 8-9.  The Trustee seeks to recover $51 million on behalf of Weis in its own right and on behalf of the customers of Weis whose property the Trustee was unable to return.  SIPC claims $14 million, either as subrogee of Weis\' customers whose claims it has paid under SIPA or in its own right.  The federal claims are based on \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the 1934 Act; the complaint also alleges several state common law causes of action based on accountants\' negligence, breach of contract, and breach of warranty. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that no claim for relief was stated because no private cause of action could be implied from \xc2\xa7 17(a).  428 F.Supp. 483 (SDNY 1977). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  A divided panel of the Second Circuit reversed.  592 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 442 U. S. 567</a></p><p> F.2d 617 (1978).  The court first found that \xc2\xa7 17(a) imposes a duty on accountants.  592 F.2d at 621.  It next concluded, based on the factors set forth in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U.

The court held that SIPC and the Trustee could assert this implied cause of action on behalf of the Weis customers. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 979 (1978), and we now reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 442 U.

By contrast, \xc2\xa7 17(a) neither confers rights on private parties nor proscribes any conduct as unlawful.</p>\n<p>The intent of \xc2\xa7 17(a) is evident from its face.  Section 17(a) is like provisions in countless other statutes that simply require certain regulated businesses to keep records and file periodic reports to enable the relevant governmental authorities to perform their regulatory functions.  The reports and records provide the regulatory authorities with the necessary information to oversee compliance with and enforce the various statutes and regulations with which they are concerned.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 442 U. S. 570</a></p><p> In this case, the \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports, along with inspections and other information, enable the Commission and the Exchange to ensure compliance with the "net capital rule," the principal regulatory tool by which the Commission and the Exchange monitor the financial health of brokerage firms and protect customers from the risks involved in leaving their cash and securities with broker-dealers. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The information contained in the \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports is intended to provide the Commission, the Exchange, and other authorities with a sufficiently early warning to enable them to take appropriate action to protect investors before the financial collapse of the particular broker-dealer involved.  But \xc2\xa7 17(a) does not, by any stretch of its language, purport to confer private damages rights or, indeed, any remedy in the event the regulatory authorities are unsuccessful in achieving their objectives and the broker becomes insolvent before corrective steps can be taken.  By its terms, \xc2\xa7 17(a) is forward-looking, not retrospective; it seeks to forestall insolvency, not to provide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="571">Page 442 U. S. 571</a></p><p> recompense after it has occurred.  In short, there is no basis in the language of \xc2\xa7 17(a) for inferring that a civil cause of action for damages lay in favor of anyone.  <em>Cort v Ash,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#79">422 U. S. 79</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals recognized, the legislative history of the 1934 Act is entirely silent on the question whether a private right of action for damages should or should not be available under \xc2\xa7 17(a) in the circumstances of this case.  592 F.2d at 622.  SIPC and the Trustee nevertheless argue that, because Congress did not express an intent to deny a private cause of action under \xc2\xa7 17(a), this Court should infer one.  But implying a private right of action on the basis of congressional silence is a hazardous enterprise, at best.  <em>See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html">436 U. S. 49</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#64">436 U. S. 64</a></span> (1978).  And where, as here, the plain language of the provision weighs against implication of a private remedy, the fact that there is no suggestion whatsoever in the legislative history that \xc2\xa7 17(a) may give rise to suits for damages reinforces our decision not to find such a right of action implicit within the section.  <em>See Cort v.

Obviously, then, when Congress wished to provide a private damages remedy, it knew how to do so, and did so expressly.  <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html">421 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78r(a); <em>see Ernst &amp; Ernst v.

Since SIPC and the Trustee do not allege that the Weis customers purchased </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 442 U. S. 573</a></p><p> or sold securities in reliance on the \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports at issue, they cannot sue Touche Ross under \xc2\xa7 18(a). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Instead, their claim is that the Weis customers did not get the enforcement action they would have received if the \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports had been accurate. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  SIPC and the Trustee argue that \xc2\xa7 18(a) cannot provide the exclusive remedy for misstatements made in \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports because the cause of action created by \xc2\xa7 18(a) is expressly limited to purchasers and sellers.  They assert that Congress could not have intended in \xc2\xa7 18(a) to deprive customers, such as those whom they seek to represent, of a cause of action for misstatements contained in \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports.</p>\n<p>There is evidence to support the view that \xc2\xa7 18(a) was intended to provide the exclusive remedy for misstatements contained in any reports filed with the Commission, including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 442 U. S. 574</a></p><p> those filed pursuant to \xc2\xa7 17(a). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Certainly, SIPC and the Trustee have pointed to no evidence of a legislative intent to except \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports from \xc2\xa7 18(a)\'s purview.  <em>Cf. Securities Investor Protection Corp.,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/412/case.html#419">421 U.

But we need not decide whether Congress expressly intended \xc2\xa7 18(a) to provide the exclusive remedy for misstatements contained in \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports.  For where the principal express civil remedy for misstatements in reports created by Congress contemporaneously with the passage of \xc2\xa7 17(a) is, by its terms, limited to purchasers and sellers of securities, we are extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action in \xc2\xa7 17(a) that is significantly broader than the remedy that Congress chose to provide.  <em>Blue Chip Stamps v.

S. 575</a></p><p></p>\n<p>SIPC and the Trustee urge, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the analysis should not stop here.  Relying on the factors set forth in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/1/case.html#7">422 U. S. 7</a></span>, they assert that we also must consider whether an implied private remedy is necessary to "effectuate the purpose of the section," and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law.  SIPC and the Trustee contend that implication of a private remedy is essential to the goals of \xc2\xa7 17(a) and that enforcement of \xc2\xa7 17(a) is properly a matter of federal, not state, concern.  Brief for Respondent Redington 30-35; Brief for Respondent SIPC 42-52.  We need not reach the merits of the arguments concerning the "necessity" of implying a private remedy and the proper forum for enforcement of the rights asserted by SIPC and the Trustee, for we believe such inquiries have little relevance to the decision of this case.  It is true that, in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> the Court set forth four factors that it considered "relevant" in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one.  But the Court did not decide that each of these factors is entitled to equal weight.  The central inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action.  Indeed, the first three factors discussed in <em>Cort</em> -- the language and focus of the statute, its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 442 U. S. 576</a></p><p> legislative history, and its purpose, <em>see</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span> -- are ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative intent.  Here, the statute, by its terms, grants no private rights to any identifiable class, and proscribes no conduct as unlawful.  And the parties, as well as the Court of Appeals, agree that the legislative history of the 1934 Act simply does not speak to the issue of private remedies under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  At least in such a case as this, the inquiry ends there:  the question whether Congress, either expressly or by implication, intended to create a private right of action has been definitely answered in the negative.</p>\n<p>Finally, SIPA and the Trustee argue that our decision in <em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/426/case.html">377 U. S. 426</a></span> (1964), requires implication of a private cause of action under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  In <em>Borak,</em> the Court found in \xc2\xa7 14(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(a), an implied cause of action for damages in favor of shareholders for losses resulting from deceptive proxy solicitations in violation of \xc2\xa7 14(a).  SIPC and the Trustee emphasize language in <em>Borak</em> that discusses the remedial purposes of the 1934 Act and \xc2\xa7 27 of the Act, which, <em>inter alia,</em> grants to federal district courts the exclusive jurisdiction of violations of the Act and suits to enforce any liability or duty created by the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  They argue that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="577">Page 442 U. S. 577</a></p><p> Touche Ross has breached its duties under \xc2\xa7 17(a) and the rules adopted thereunder, and that, in view of \xc2\xa7 27 and of the remedial purposes of the 1934 Act, federal courts should provide a damages remedy for the breach. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The reliance of SIPC and the Trustee on \xc2\xa7 27 is misplaced.  Section 27 grants jurisdiction to the federal courts and provides for venue and service of process.  It creates no cause of action of its own force and effect; it imposes no liabilities.  The source of plaintiffs\' rights must be found, if at all, in the substantive provisions of the 1934 Act which they seek to enforce, not in the jurisdictional provision.  <em>See Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/35/case.html#44">421 U. S. 44</a></span>.  The Court in <em>Borak</em> found a private cause of action implicit in 14(a).  <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U. S. 690</a></span>-693, n. 13; <em>Piper v.

We do not now question the actual holding of that case, but we decline to read the opinion so broadly that virtually every provision of the securities Acts gives rise to an implied private cause of action.  <em>E.g., Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., supra.</em> [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 442 U. S. 578</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The invocation of the "remedial purposes" of the 1934 Act is similarly unavailing.  Only last Term, we emphasized that generalized references to the "remedial purposes" of the 1934 Act will not justify reading a provision "more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit."  <em>SEC v. Sloan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/103/case.html">436 U. S. 103</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/103/case.html#116">436 U.

Certainly, the mere fact that \xc2\xa7 17(a) was designed to provide protection for brokers\' customers does not require the implication of a private damages action in their behalf.  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#688">441 U.

S. 421</a></span>.  To the extent our analysis in today\'s decision differs from that of the Court in <em>Borak,</em> it suffices to say that, in a series of cases since <em>Borak,</em> we have adhered to a stricter standard for the implication of private causes of action, and we follow that stricter standard today.  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#699">441 U. S. 688</a></span>-709.  The ultimate question is one of congressional intent, not one of whether this Court thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that Congress enacted into law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 442 U. S. 579</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>SIPC and the Trustee contend that the result we reach sanctions injustice.  But even if that were the case, the argument is made in the wrong forum, for we are not at liberty to legislate.  If there is to be a federal damages remedy under these circumstances, Congress must provide it.  "[I]t is not for us to fill any hiatus Congress has left in this area."  <em>Wheeldin v.

Obviously, nothing we have said prevents Congress from creating a private right of action on behalf of brokerage firm customers for losses arising from misstatements contained in \xc2\xa7 17(a) reports.  But if Congress intends those customers to have such a federal right of action, it is well aware of how it may effectuate that intent.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

Subsequent marshaling of assets and recoveries in other litigation apparently have reduced the amount of the deficit in the fund of customer property.  Brief for Respondent Redington 10 n. 5.  The Weis customer accounts were protected by SIPA up to a maximum of $50,000 for each customer, except that cash claims were limited to $20,000.  15 U.S. C. \xc2\xa7 78fff(f).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Approximately one year prior to institution of this action in federal court, SIPC and the Trustee commenced a nearly identical suit against Touche Ross in New York state court.  <em>Redington v. Touche Ross &amp; Co.,</em> Index No. 13996/76 (N.Y.S.Ct., N.Y.County).  The parties, factual allegations, claims, and requests for damages are the same in the state court action as they are in the federal suit, except that there is no claim in the state court action under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  Touche Ross has begun discovery in the state court action, but otherwise it has remained virtually inactive since the filing of the complaint.  592 F.2d at 620 n. 7.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In the District Court\'s view, \xc2\xa7 17(a) was essentially a bookkeeping provision.  By its terms, it did not impose any duty on accountants and did not "create any rights in anybody."  428 F.Supp. at 489, 491.  By contrast, the court noted that \xc2\xa7 18(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78r(a), did create an express private right of action for damages arising from materially misleading statements in any report filed pursuant to the 1934 Act in favor of any person who, in reliance on the statements, purchased or sold a security whose price was affected by the statements.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">n</a> 12, <em>infra.</em>  SIPC and the Trustee could not sue under \xc2\xa7 18(a) because neither they nor Weis\' customers had bought or sold stock in reliance on the reports Touche Ross had prepared and certified.  In view of \xc2\xa7 18(a), the court declined to infer a private right of action under \xc2\xa7 17(a) broader than the express remedy Congress had created in the very next section of the Act.  The court concluded that the subject matter, titles, and juxtaposition of the two sections "strongly suggest a legislative intent that the only private claim for a violation of Section 17 was the claim created in Section 18."  428 F.Supp. at 489.</p>\n<p>The District Court also held that, since the \xc2\xa7 17(a) claim should be dismissed, there was no basis for exercising pendent jurisdiction over the common law claims, and that there was no other basis for exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the common law claims.  428 F.Supp. at 492-493.  None of these latter rulings is before us.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The court rejected the District Court\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 18(a) was intended to be the exclusive remedy for violation of \xc2\xa7 17(a).  Because, in the court\'s view, it was plain that brokers\' customers were the "favored wards" of \xc2\xa7 17(a), it could not agree that "Congress simultaneously sought to protect a class and deprived the class [by virtue of \xc2\xa7 18\'s limiting language] of the means of protection."  592 F.2d at 623.  The court held that the Trustee could assert the \xc2\xa7 17(a) action on behalf of the Weis customers as "bailee" of the customer property that he was unable to return, and that SIPC could sue on behalf of the customers as "subrogee" of the customers whose claims it had paid.  592 F.2d at 624-625.  The court also held that the Trustee could not maintain the \xc2\xa7 17(a) action in its own right, and it reserved decision on whether "SIPC could ever have a claim for damages other than on behalf of a broker\'s customers."  592 F.2d at 624, and n. 13.  The court remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of whether to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state actions in light of the Court of Appeals\' ruling on \xc2\xa7 17(a) and whether to stay the federal action pending determination of the state action.  592 F.2d at 619 n. 3, 625.  Since we hold that the Court of Appeals wrongly implied a private federal claim under \xc2\xa7 17(a), it is unnecessary to reach these other rulings by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers, Report and Recommendations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R.Doc.

The District Court in that case dismissed the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs did not meet the purchaser-seller requirement of \xc2\xa7 18(a), and thus could not maintain an action under that section.  <em>Rich v.

Moreover, if a liquidation of Weis had become necessary as the result of . . . truthful reporting, such liquidation could have occurred at the end of Weis\' 1972 fiscal year, when its assets were greater and the aggregate of its liabilities was lower than a year later."</p>\n<p>App. 8-9.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, Senator Fletcher in introducing the bill that formed the basis for the 1934 Act, stated that "Section [18] imposes civil liability for false or misleading statements <em>in any of the reports</em> or records required under this act."  78 Cong.Rec. 2271 (1934) (emphasis added).  Richard Whitney, President of the New York Stock Exchange, testified at length regarding the 1934 Act proposals.  In testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, he indicated his understanding that \xc2\xa7 18(a) liability extended to "persons transacting business in securities."

Congress specifically enacted SIPA in 1970 to afford customers of broker-dealers, such as Weis\' customers, protection against losses they might incur as a result of the financial failure of their broker-dealer.  SIPA established a comprehensive plan of insurance for customers of brokerage firms.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  And recently, Congress has increased the amounts by which customer accounts are insured to $40,000 for cash claims and $100,000 for cash and securities claims.  Securities Investor Protection Act Amendments of 1978, \xc2\xa7 9, 92 Stat. 265, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78fff-3 (1976 ed., Supp. III).  Touche Ross asserts that there is no indication in the legislative history of SIPA or its amendments that Congress thought the 1934 Act contained a remedy for customers of insolvent brokerage firms.  Brief for Petitioner 62, n. 37; Reply Brief for Petitioner 11-12.  It claims that Congress believed it was "<em>filling a regulatory void\'" when it passed SIPA.  <em>Id.</em> at 12; <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 91-1218, p. 3 (1970).  Given the fact that our task is to discern the intent of Congress when it enacted \xc2\xa7 17(a) in 1934, we doubt the relevance of SIPA to our inquiry.  And even if the 91st Congress had believed that there was an implied right of action under \xc2\xa7 17(a), SIPA still would have been needed to protect customers in situations where there was no fraud or where the fraud was committed only by the broker, who, because of its insolvency, would probably be judgment-proof.  Accordingly, our decision not to infer a right of action in favor of brokerage customers from \xc2\xa7 17(a) is not influenced by the existence of SIPA.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 27, as set forth in 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78aa, provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"The district courts of the United States, and the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.

There is no similar history of longstanding lower court interpretation in this case.  Indeed, only one other court in the 45-year history of the 1934 Act has held that a private cause of action for damages is available under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  <em>Hawkins v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane,</em> 85 F.Supp. 104, 124 (WD Ark.1949).  In <em>Hawkins,</em> a national brokerage firm was held liable for damages under \xc2\xa7 17(a) to a defalcating correspondent\'s customers for improperly advising the correspondent, who was found to be controlled by the national firm, to describe its business in such a way as to avoid filing certified financial statements with the Commission under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  Citing <em>Kardon v. National Gypsum Co.,</em> 69 F.Supp. 512 (ED Pa.1946), the District Court simply stated that violation of any of the provisions of the 1934 Act would give rise to a civil suit for damages on the part of the one injured, and that the defendants did not contend to the contrary.  85 F.Supp. at 121.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion.  The Court of Appeals implied a cause of action for damages under \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78q(a), in favor of respondents, who purport to represent customers of a bankrupt brokerage firm, against petitioner accounting firm, which allegedly injured those customers by improperly preparing and certifying the reports on the brokerage firm required by \xc2\xa7 17(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder.  Under the tests established in our prior cases, no cause of action should be implied for respondents under \xc2\xa7 17(a).  Although analyses of the several factors outlined in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U.

Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?  Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?  And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?"</p>\n<p><em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U.

Applying these factors, I believe respondents are entitled to bring an action against accountants who have allegedly breached duties imposed under \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78q(a).</p>\n<p>Since respondents seek relief on behalf of brokerage firm customers, the first inquiry is whether those customers are the intended beneficiaries of the regulatory scheme.  Under \xc2\xa7 17(a), brokers must file such reports "as the [SEC], by rule, prescribes as necessary or appropriate . . . <em>for the protection of investors.</em>"  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78q(a)(1) (emphasis added).  <em>Cf.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 442 U.

Pursuant to this authority, the SEC requires brokers to provide a battery of financial statements, and directs independent accountants to verify the brokers\' reports.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.17a-5 (1978); <em>see also ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#563">442 U. S. 563</a></span>-564, n. 3.  The purpose of these requirements, as the Commission has consistently emphasized, is to enable regulators to</p>\n<p>"monitor the financial health of brokerage firms and protect customers from the risks involved in leaving their cash and securities with broker-dealers."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#570">442 U. S. 570</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In addition, at the time of the events giving rise to this suit, the rules implementing \xc2\xa7 17 mandated that brokers disclose to customers whether an accountant\'s audit had revealed any "material inadequacies" in financial procedures.  37 Fed.Reg. 14608 (1972).  Thus, it is clear that brokerage firm customers are the "favored wards" of \xc2\xa7 17, 592 F.2d 617, 623 (CA2 1978), and that the initial test of <em>Cort v. Ash</em> is satisfied here. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>With respect to the second <em>Cort</em> factor, the legislative history does not explicitly address the availability of a damages remedy under \xc2\xa7 17.  The majority, however, discerns an intent to deny private remedies from two aspects of the statutory scheme.  Because unrelated sections in the 1934 Act expressly grant private rights of action for violation of their terms, the Court suggests that Congress would have made such provision under \xc2\xa7 17 had it wished to do so.  But as we noted recently in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">Cannon v. University of Chicago,</a></span></em> 441 U.S. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="582">Page 442 U. S. 582</a></p><p> 677,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#711">441 U. S. 711</a></span> (1979),</p>\n<p>"that other provisions of a complex statutory scheme create express remedies has not been accepted as a sufficient reason for refusing to imply an otherwise appropriate remedy under a separate section."</p>\n<p>The Court finds a further indication of congressional intent in the interaction between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa717 and 18 of the 1934 Act.  Section 18(a), 15 U.S.C.  78r(a), affords an express remedy for misstatements in reports filed with the Commission, apparently including reports required by \xc2\xa717, but limits relief to purchasers or sellers of securities whose price was affected by the misstatement.  In light of this limitation, the majority reasons, we should not imply a remedy under \xc2\xa7 17 which embraces a broader class of plaintiffs.  However, \xc2\xa7 18 pertains to investors who are injured in the course of securities transactions, while \xc2\xa7 17 is concerned exclusively with brokerage firm customers who may be injured by a broker\'s insolvency.  Given this divergence in focus, \xc2\xa718 does not reflect an intent to restrict the remedies available under \xc2\xa7 17.  Indeed, since false reports regarding a broker\'s financial condition would not affect the price of securities held by the broker\'s customers, \xc2\xa7 18 would provide these persons with no remedy at all.  I am unwilling to assume that "Congress simultaneously sought to protect a class and deprived [it] of the means of protection."  592 F.2d at 623.</p>\n<p>A cause of action for damages here is also consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme.  Because the SEC lacks the resources to audit all the documents that brokers file, it must rely on certification by accountants.  <em>See J. I. Case Co. v.
