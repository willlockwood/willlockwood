Nevertheless, the court felt bound by precedent and attempted to reconcile the two lines of cases. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, although the Government must prove at trial that the defendant has committed an overt act in furtherance of a narcotics conspiracy, the act need not be alleged in the indictment because" \'[c]ourts do not require as detailed a statement of an offense\'s elements under a conspiracy count as under a substantive count.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 1422, quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Tavelman, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/650/1133/">650 F.2d 1133</a>, 1137 (CA9 1981).</p><p>Chief Judge Wallace wrote separately to point out that in no other circumstance could the Government refrain from alleging in the indictment an element it had to prove at trial. He followed the Circuit precedent but invited the Court of Appeals to consider the question en banc because the Ninth Circuit, "contrary to every other circuit, clings to a problematic gloss on 21 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 846, insisting, despite a complete lack of textual support in the statute, that in order to convict under this section the government must prove the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy." 993 F. 2d, at 1422 (concurring opinion). For reasons unknown, the Court of Appeals did not grant en banc review. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1108 (1994), to resolve the conflict between the Ninth Circuit and the 11 other Circuits that have addressed the question, all of which have held that \xc2\xa7 846 does not require proof of an overt act. *</p><p>*See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sassi, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/966/283/">966 F.2d 283</a>, 285 <i>(CA7), </i>cert. denied, 506 U.

L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. It provided: "Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy." <i>Id., </i>at 1265. As amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100690, \xc2\xa7 6470(a), 102 Stat. 4377, the statute currently provides:</p><p>"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy." 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 846. The language of neither version requires that an overt act be committed to further the conspiracy, and we have not inferred such a requirement from congressional silence in other conspiracy statutes. In <i>Nash </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/229/373/case.html">229 U. S. 373</a> (1913), Justice Holmes wrote, "[WJe can see no reason for reading into the Sherman Act more than we find there," <i>id., </i>at 378, and the Court held that an overt act is not required for antitrust conspiracy liability. The same reasoning prompted our conclusion in <i>Singer </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/338/case.html">323 U. S. 338</a> (1945), that the Selective Service Act "does not require an overt act for the offense of conspiracy." <i>Id., </i>at 340.</p><p><i>Nash </i>and <i>Singer </i>follow the settled principle of statutory construction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms. See <i>Molzof </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/301/case.html">502 U. S. 301</a>, 307-308 (1992).

S. 464</a>, 468 (1895) ("At common law it was neither necessary to aver nor prove an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy ... "). Respondent contends that these decisions were rendered in a period of unfettered expansion in the law of conspiracy, a period which allegedly ended when the Court declared that "we will view with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions." <i>Grunewald </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/391/case.html">353 U. S. 391</a>, 404 (1957) (citations omitted). <i>Grunewald, </i>however, was a statute of limitations case, and whatever exasperation with conspiracy prosecutions the opinion may have expressed in dictum says little about the views of Congress when it enacted \xc2\xa7 846.</p><p>As to those views, we find it instructive that the general conspiracy statute, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 371, contains an explicit requirement that a conspirator "do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy." In light of this additional element in the general conspiracy statute, Congress\' silence in \xc2\xa7 846 speaks volumes. After all, the general conspiracy statute preceded and presumably provided the framework for the more specific drug conspiracy statute. <i>"Nash </i>and <i>Singer </i>give Congress a formulary: by choosing a text modeled on \xc2\xa7 371, it gets an overt-act requirement; by choosing a text modeled on the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1, it dispenses with such a requirement." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sassi, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/966/283/">966 F.2d 283</a>, 284 (CA7 1992). Congress appears to have made the choice quite deliberately with respect to \xc2\xa7 846; the same Congress that passed this provision also enacted the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, \xc2\xa7802(a) of which contains an explicit requirement that "one or more of [the conspirators] does any act to effect the object of such a conspiracy," <i>id., </i>at 936, codified at 18 U.

See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Monroe, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/552/860/">552 F.2d 860</a>, 862 (CA9), cert. denied, 431 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 846, the Government need not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Felix, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/378/case.html">503 U. S. 378</a> (1992), is not to the contrary. In that case, an indictment under \xc2\xa7 846 alleged two overt acts which had formed the basis of the defendant\'s prior conviction for attempting to manufacture drugs. The defendant argued that the Government had violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and <i>Grady </i>v. <i>Corbin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/508/case.html">495 U. S. 508</a> (1990), overruled, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Dixon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/509/688/case.html">509 U. S. 688</a> (1993), by using evidence underlying the prior conviction "to prove an essential element of an offense" charged in the second prosecution. We held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the conspiracy charge. JUSTICE STEVENS, writing separately, thought that our double jeopardy discussion was unnecessary partly because "there is no overt act requirement in the federal drug conspiracy statute," <i>Felix, supra, </i>at 392 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Shabani argues that, by not responding to this point, the Court im-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="16">16</a></p><p>plicitly held that \xc2\xa7 846 requires proof of overt acts; otherwise, the double jeopardy discussion would have been merely advisory. The procedural history of <i>Felix, </i>however, belies this contention. The disputed evidence was offered not to prove overt acts <i>qua </i>overt acts, but to prove the existence of a conspiracy. The lower court in <i>Felix </i>noted that it was "mindful that 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 846 does not require proof of an overt act .... " <i>United States </i>v. <i>Felix, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/926/1522/">926 F.2d 1522</a>, 1529, n. 7 (CAlO 1991). Nevertheless, evidence of such acts raised double jeopardy concerns because it "tended to show the criminal agreement for the conspiracy," an indisputably essential element of the offense. <i>Ibid. </i>Indeed, JUSTICE STEVENS also argued that "the overt acts did not establish an agreement between Felix and his co-conspirators." <i>Felix, </i>503 U. S., at 392. In light of the lower court opinion, it is apparent that we rejected this point-rather than JusTICE STEVENS\' construction of \xc2\xa7 846-before reaching the double jeopardy issue. In any event, Shabani\'s strained reading of <i>Felix </i>is of little consequence for precedential purposes, since "[q]uestions which \'merely lurk in the record\' are not resolved, and no resolution of them may be inferred." <i>Illinois Bd. of Elections </i>v. <i>Socialist Workers Party, 440 </i>U. S. 173, 183 (1979), quoting <i>Webster </i>v. <i>Fall, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/266/507/case.html">266 U. S. 507</a>, 511 (1925).</p><p>Shabani reminds us that the law does not punish criminal thoughts and contends that conspiracy without an overt act requirement violates this principle because the offense is predominantly mental in composition. The prohibition against criminal conspiracy, however, does not punish mere thought; the criminal agreement itself is the <i>actus reus </i>and has been so viewed since <i>Regina </i>v. <i>Bass, </i>11 Mod. 55, 88 Eng. Rep. 881, 882 (K. B. 1705) ("[T]he very assembling together was an overt act"); see also <i>Iannelli </i>v. <i>United States, 420 </i>U. S. 770, 777 (1975) ("Conspiracy is an inchoate offense, the essence of which is an agreement to commit an unlawful act") (citations omitted).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="17">17</a></p><p>Finally, Shabani invokes the rule of lenity, arguing that the statute is unclear because it neither requires an overt act nor specifies that one is not necessary. The rule of lenity, however, applies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Beecham </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/case.html">511 U. S. 368</a>, 374 (1994); <i>Smith </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/case.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 239-241 (1993). That is not the case here.
