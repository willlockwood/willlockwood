And thereupon the defendant in error, by plea, averred in the said circuit court that the said slaves, at the time &amp;c., were the property of the said Chewning, and upon this plea issue was tendered and joined between the defendant in error and the plaintiff in error.

On his examination, the counsel for the plaintiff in error exhibited to the witness a mortgage, marked A, made by him to the Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg, dated 31 December, 1839, and in answer to questions proposed by said counsel he deposed that he executed the mortgage on the day of its date, that he then owed the bank $130,000 &amp;c., that all the slaves seized under the execution were embraced in the mortgage except Juliana.  The counsel also exhibited to the witness mortgages made by him, as follows:  one to William M. Beal dated 7 March, 1842, and marked B; one to James Cuddy dated 13 July, 1840, and marked C; one to F. Sims, dated 13 July, 1840, and marked D; one to the plaintiff in error, dated 8 September, 1841, and marked E; and witness deposed to the execution of the same at the times of their respective dates; that some of the slaves in controversy were embraced in each of the said mortgages, and in that to the plaintiff in error, all except Juliana; that he was indebted to the mortgages respectively in the sums mentioned in the instruments; that all the salves in controversy, except Juliana, were on December 31, 1839, in Carroll Parish, Louisiana, and so remained until removed by the witness into Mississippi in March, 1842, in consequence of his having sold his lands in Louisiana.</p>\n<p>The mortgages were referred to in and accompanied the deposition. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 51 U.

Chewning, at the instance of the defendant in error, which slaves were claimed by the plaintiff in error, an issue was joined under the laws of Mississippi to try the right of property.  On the trial, a mortgage was given in evidence, executed by Chewning in 1839, long prior to the levy, to secure to the Railroad Bank of Vicksburg a debt of $130,000.  This mortgage embraced all the slaves levied on except one.  Other mortgages were given in evidence, executed by Chewning, to secure the payment of several other debts.</p>\n<p>On the trial, the circuit court instructed the jury that if "any one of the mortgages conveyed more property than would be sufficient to secure the debt provided for in the mortgage, such mortgage was fraudulent," and that the fact of more property being conveyed as aforesaid was a circumstance from which the jury might presume fraud.</p>\n<p>This instruction is erroneous.  It is no badge of fraud for a mortgage, which is a mere security, to cover more property than will secure the debt due.  Any creditor may pay the mortgage debt and proceed against the property, or he may subject it to the payment of his debt by other modes of proceeding.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the circuit court is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and a venire de novo awarded.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby reversed, with costs, and that this cause be and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court with directions to award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
