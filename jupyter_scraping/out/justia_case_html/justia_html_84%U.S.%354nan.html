That act, however, does not prescribe the existing rule.  The Act of June 1, 1872,<l=> which must govern the case, allows sixty days for the filing of the bond by which the appeal is made to operate as a supersedeas.</l=></p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n<p>* This was the last opinion ever delivered by CHIEF JUSTICE CHASE, and the last also given in the December Term, 1872.
