Buckley distinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected \n \nFirst Amendment interests.  It subjected expenditure limits to \xe2\x80\x9cthe exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core \n \nFirst Amendment rights of political expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  But it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still \xe2\x80\x9crigorous standard of review,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 29, under which such limits \xe2\x80\x9cmay be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 25.  Because the Court found that the primary purpose of FECA\xe2\x80\x94preventing quid pro quo corruption and its appearance\xe2\x80\x94was a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d governmental interest, id., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, it upheld the base limit under the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test, id., at 29.  After doing so, the Court devoted only one paragraph of its 139-page opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under FECA, noting that the provision \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38.  It concluded that the aggregate limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was \xe2\x80\x9cno more than a corollary\xe2\x80\x9d of that limit.  Id., at 38.

Regardless whether strict scrutiny or the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test applies, the analysis turns on the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.  Here, given the substantial mismatch between the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBuckley\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control here.  Buckley spent just three sentences analyzing that limit, which had not been separately addressed by the parties.  Appellants here, by contrast, have directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under BCRA, a different statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct legal backdrop.  Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since Buckley.  The 1976 FECA Amendments added another layer of base limits\xe2\x80\x94capping contributions from individuals to political committees\xe2\x80\x94and an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.  Since Buckley, the Federal Election Commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme that further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits through \xe2\x80\x9cunearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular candidate.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  In addition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes, appellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in Buckley, including an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit.

Contributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.  A restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest restraint\xe2\x80\x9d on those rights.  The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.  In its simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits.  And it is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less than the base limits permit: To require one person to contribute at lower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to penalize that individual for \xe2\x80\x9crobustly exercis[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d his \n \nFirst Amendment rights.

See Davis, supra, at 741.  Moreover, the only type of corruption that Congress may target is quid pro quo corruption.  Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corruption.  Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence over or access to\xe2\x80\x9d elected officials or political parties.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, \n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310\n.

The difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contributions of any amount, even though Congress\xe2\x80\x99s selection of a base limit indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not create a cognizable risk of corruption.  The Government must thus defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits, a function they do not serve in any meaningful way.  Given the statutes and regulations currently in effect, Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s fear that an individual might \xe2\x80\x9ccontribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unearmarked contributions\xe2\x80\x9d to entities likely to support the candidate, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38, is far too speculative.  Even accepting Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive \xe2\x80\x9cmassive amounts of money\xe2\x80\x9d that could be traced back to a particular donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s scenarios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or implausible.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9330.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(3)\xc2\xa0The aggregate limits also violate the \n \nFirst Amendment because they are not \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buckley, supra, at 25.  The Government argues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation, but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are retained and spent by their recipients.  And the Government has provided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.  The indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is thus disproportionate to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing circumvention. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImportantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress that would serve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing circumvention while avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary abridgment\xe2\x80\x9d of \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  Buckley, supra, at 25.  Such alternatives might include targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees, or tighter earmarking rules.  Transfers, after all, are the key to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concern about circumvention, but they can be addressed without such a direct and broad interference with \n \nFirst Amendment rights.

Disclosure requirements, which are justified by \xe2\x80\x9ca governmental interest in \xe2\x80\x98provid[ing] the electorate with information\xe2\x80\x99 about the sources of election-related spending,\xe2\x80\x9d Citizens United, supra, at 367, may deter corruption \xe2\x80\x9cby exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckley, supra at 67.  Disclosure requirements may burden speech, but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.  Particularly with modern technology, disclosure now offers more robust protections against corruption than it did when Buckley was decided.

That rationale dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior cases.  Buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cmassive amounts of money\xe2\x80\x9d could be funneled to a particular candidate in excess of the base limits.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  Recasting as corruption a donor\xe2\x80\x99s widely distributed support for a political party would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.  And though the Government suggests that solicitation of large contributions poses the corruption danger, the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.

A single donor might contribute the maximum amount under the base limits to nearly 50 separate committees, each of which might then transfer the money to the same single committee.  Ibid.  That committee, in turn, might use all the transferred money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate, allowing the single donor to circumvent the base limit on the amount he may contribute to that candidate.

Valeo, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, presented this Court with its first opportunity to evaluate the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits set forth in FECA.  FECA imposed a $1,000 per election base limit on contributions from an individual to a federal candidate.  It also imposed a $25,000 per year aggregate limit on all contributions from an individual to candidates or political committees.  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7608(b)(1), 608(b)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).

But it distinguished expenditure limits from contribution limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected \n \nFirst Amendment interests.  Expenditure limits, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily reduce[ ] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 19.  The Court thus subjected expenditure limits to \xe2\x80\x9cthe exacting scrutiny applicable to lim- itations on core \n \nFirst Amendment rights of political expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Under exacting scrutiny, the Government may regulate protected speech only if such regulation promotes a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.  See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, \n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, \n126 (1989)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, the Court concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech because they \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[ ] the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but do[ ] not in any way infringe the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to discuss candidates and issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 21.  As a result, the Court focused on the effect of the contribution limits on the freedom of political association and applied a lesser but still \xe2\x80\x9crigorous standard of review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 29.  Under that standard, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven a \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csignificant interference\xe2\x80\x9d with protected rights of political association\xe2\x80\x99 may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 25 (quoting Cousins v. Wigoda, \n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, \n488 (1975)\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe primary purpose of FECA was to limit quid pro quo corruption and its appearance; that purpose satisfied the requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d governmental interest.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  As for the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d component, Buckley concluded that the $1,000 base limit \xe2\x80\x9cfocuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 28.  The Court therefore upheld the $1,000 base limit under the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test.

See id., at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  The challengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad because most large donors do not seek improper influence over legislators\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  Although the Court accepted that premise, it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth challenge for two reasons: First, it was too \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to isolate suspect contributions\xe2\x80\x9d based on a contributor\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent.  Id., at 30.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, in one paragraph of its 139-page opinion, the Court turned to the $25,000 aggregate limit under FECA.  As a preliminary matter, it noted that the constitution- ality of the aggregate limit \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38.  Then, in three sentences, the Court disposed of any constitutional objections to the aggregate limit that the challengers might have had:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.  But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s political party.  The limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties and amici curiae spend significant energy debating whether the line that Buckley drew between contributions and expenditures should remain the law.  Notwithstanding the robust debate, we see no need in this case to revisit Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corollary distinction in the applicable standards of review.  Buckley held that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327; we have elsewhere stated that the same interest may properly be labeled \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling,\xe2\x80\x9d see National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 496\xe2\x80\x93497, so that the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny.  Moreover, regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test, we must assess the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.  See, e.g., National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra, at 496\xe2\x80\x93501; Randall v. Sorrell, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 230\n\xe2\x80\x93262 (2006) (opinion of Breyer, J.).  Or to put it another way, if a law that restricts political speech does not \xe2\x80\x9cavoid unnecessary abridgement\xe2\x80\x9d of \n \nFirst Amendment rights, Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25, it cannot survive \xe2\x80\x9crigorous\xe2\x80\x9d review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause we find a substantial mismatch between the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d test.  We therefore need not parse the differences between the two standards in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBuckley treated the constitutionality of the $25,000 aggregate limit as contingent upon that limit\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prevent circumvention of the $1,000 base limit, describing the aggregate limit as \xe2\x80\x9cno more than a corollary\xe2\x80\x9d of the base limit.  Id., at 38.  The Court determined that circumvention could occur when an individual legally contributes \xe2\x80\x9cmassive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions\xe2\x80\x9d to entities that are themselves likely to contribute to the candidate.  Ibid.  For that reason, the Court upheld the $25,000 aggregate limit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough Buckley provides some guidance, we think that its ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control here.  Buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing that limit; in fact, the opinion pointed out that the constitutionality of the aggregate limit \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We are now asked to address appellants\xe2\x80\x99 direct challenge to the aggregate limits in place under BCRA.

Because a donor\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to a political committee are now limited, a donor cannot flood the committee with \xe2\x80\x9chuge\xe2\x80\x9d amounts of money so that each contribution the committee makes is perceived as a contribution from him.  Buckley, supra, at 38.  Rather, the donor may contribute only $5,000 to the committee, which hardly raises the specter of abuse that concerned the Court in Buckley.  Limits on contributions to political committees consequently create an additional hurdle for a donor who seeks both to channel a large amount of money to a particular candidate and to ensure that he gets the credit for doing so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 1976 Amendments also added an antiprolifera- tion rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.

In effect, the rule eliminates a donor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to create and use his own political committees to direct funds in excess of the individual base limits.  It thus blocks a straightforward method of achieving the circumvention that was the underlying concern in Buckley.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe intricate regulatory scheme that the Federal Election Commission has enacted since Buckley further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits via \xe2\x80\x9cunearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular candidate.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  Although the earmarking provision, \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(8), was in place when Buckley was decided, the FEC has since added regulations that define earmarking broadly.  For example, the regulations construe earmarking to include any designation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or written.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.6(b)(1).  The regulations specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate may not also contribute to a single-candidate committee for that candidate.  \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(1).  Nor may an individual who has contributed to a candidate also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate, if the individual knows that \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial portion [of his contribution] will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,\xe2\x80\x9d that candidate.  \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory changes in the campaign finance arena, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 challenge raises distinct legal arguments that Buckley did not consider.  For example, presumably because of its cursory treatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit, Buckley did not separately address an overbreadth challenge with respect to that provision.  The Court rejected such a challenge to the base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect contributions.  The propriety of large contributions to in- dividual candidates turned on the subjective intent of donors, and the Court concluded that there was no way to tell which donors sought improper influence over legislators\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  See 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30.  The aggregate limit, on the other hand, was upheld as an anticircumvention measure, without considering whether it was possible to discern which donations might be used to circumvent the base limits.  See id., at 38.  The Court never addressed overbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits, where such an argument has far more force.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the foregoing, this case cannot be resolved merely by pointing to three sentences in Buckley that were written without the benefit of full briefing or argument on the issue.

See Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15.  When an individual contributes money to a candidate, he exercises both of those rights: The contribution \xe2\x80\x9cserves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cserves to affiliate a person with a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThose \n \nFirst Amendment rights are important regardless whether the individual is, on the one hand, a \xe2\x80\x9clone pamphleteer[ ] or street corner orator[ ] in the Tom Paine mold,\xe2\x80\x9d or is, on the other, someone who spends \xe2\x80\x9csubstan-tial amounts of money in order to communicate [his] political ideas through sophisticated\xe2\x80\x9d means.

As the Court explained, the \xe2\x80\x9coverall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  But the Court characterized that restriction as a \xe2\x80\x9cquite modest restraint upon protected political activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We cannot agree with that characterization.  An aggregate limit on how many candidates and committees an individual may support through contributions is not a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest restraint\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits Congress views as adequate to protect against corruption.  The individual may give up to $5,200 each to nine candidates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban on further contributions to any other candidate (beyond the additional $1,800 that may be spent before reaching the $48,600 aggregate limit).  At that point, the limits deny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive and associational rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences.  A donor must limit the number of candidates he supports, and may have to choose which of several policy concerns he will advance\xe2\x80\x94clear \n \nFirst Amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people.  To require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.  And as we have recently admonished, the Government may not penalize an individual for \xe2\x80\x9crobustly exercis[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d his \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  Davis v.

In the context of base contribution limits, Buckley observed that a supporter could vindicate his associational interests by personally volunteering his time and energy on behalf of a candidate.  See 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22, 28.  Such personal volunteering is not a realistic alternative for those who wish to support a wide variety of candidates or causes.  Other effective methods of supporting preferred candidates or causes without contributing money are reserved for a select few, such as entertainers capable of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single evening.

First, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccollective speech\xe2\x80\x9d reflected in laws is of course the will of the majority, and plainly can include laws that restrict free speech.  The whole point of the \n \nFirst Amendment is to afford individuals protection against such infringements.  The \n \nFirst Amendment does not protect the government, even when the government purports to act through legislation reflecting \xe2\x80\x9ccollective speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. United States v.

Under that accepted analysis, such restrictions are measured against the asserted public interest (usually framed as an important or compelling governmental interest).  As explained below, we do not doubt the compelling nature of the \xe2\x80\x9ccollective\xe2\x80\x9d interest in preventing corruption in the electoral process.  But we permit Congress to pursue that interest only so long as it does not unnecessarily infringe an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to freedom of speech; we do not truncate this tailoring test at the outset.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith the significant \n \nFirst Amendment costs for individual citizens in mind, we turn to the governmental interests asserted in this case.  This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.  See Davis, supra, at 741; National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 496\xe2\x80\x93497.

The definition of corruption that we apply today, however, has firm roots in Buckley itself.  The Court in that case upheld base contribution limits because they targeted \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness\xe2\x80\x9d of such a system of unchecked direct contributions.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 27.

If there is no corruption concern in giving nine candidates up to $5,200 each, it is difficult to understand how a tenth candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given $1,801, and all others corruptible if given a dime.

When an individual contributes to a candidate, a party committee, or a PAC, the individual must by law cede control over the funds.  See \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(8); 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.6.  The Government admits that if the funds are subsequently re-routed to a particular candidate, such action occurs at the initial recipient\xe2\x80\x99s discretion\xe2\x80\x94not the donor\xe2\x80\x99s.  See Brief for Appellee 37.  As a consequence, the chain of attribution grows longer, and any credit must be shared among the various actors along the way.  For those reasons, the risk of quid pro quo corruption is generally applicable only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe narrow category of money gifts that are directed, in some manner, to a candidate or officeholder.\xe2\x80\x9d  McConnell, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBuckley nonetheless focused on the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cunearmarked contributions\xe2\x80\x9d could eventually find their way to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s coffers.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  Even ac-cepting the validity of Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive amount[ ] of money\xe2\x80\x9d that could be traced back to a particular contributor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.

Then the donor also channels \xe2\x80\x9cmassive amounts of money\xe2\x80\x9d to Smith through a series of contributions to PACs that have stated their intention to support Smith.

Importantly, the donor may not contribute to the most obvious PACs: those that support only Smith.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(1); see also \xc2\xa7102.14(a).  Nor may the donor contribute to the slightly less obvious PACs that he knows will route \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of his contribution to Smith.  \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe donor must instead turn to other PACs that are likely to give to Smith.  When he does so, however, he discovers that his contribution will be significantly diluted by all the contributions from others to the same PACs.  After all, the donor cannot give more than $5,000 to a PAC and so cannot dominate the PAC\xe2\x80\x99s total receipts, as he could when Buckley was decided.  \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(C).

Of that sum, just $260 will be attributable to the donor intent on circumventing the base limits.

In the first instance, it is not true that the individual donor will necessarily have access to a sufficient number of PACs to effectuate such a scheme.  There are many PACs, but they are not limitless.  For the 2012 election cycle, the FEC reported about 2,700 nonconnected PACs (excluding PACs that finance independent expenditures only).  And not every PAC that supports Smith will work in this scheme: For our donor\xe2\x80\x99s pro\xc2\xa0rata share of a PAC\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to Smith to remain meaningful, the PAC must be funded by only a small handful of donors.  The antiproliferation rules, which were not in effect when Buckley was decided, prohibit our donor from creating 100 pro-Smith PACs of his own, or collaborating with the nine other donors to do so.  See \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(5) (\xe2\x80\x9call contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any other person, or by any group of such persons, shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, if 100 PACs were to contribute to Smith and few other candidates, and if specific individuals like our ardent Smith supporter were to contribute to each, the FEC could weigh those \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstantial factors\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether to deem the PACs affiliated.  11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.5(g)(4)(ii).  The FEC\xe2\x80\x99s analysis could take account of a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon or overlapping membership\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csimilar patterns of contributions or contributors,\xe2\x80\x9d among other considerations.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7100.5(g)(4)(ii)(D), (J).  The FEC has in the past initiated enforcement proceedings against contributors with such suspicious patterns of PAC donations.  See, e.g., Conciliation Agreement, In\xc2\xa0re Riley, Matters Under Review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19, 2001).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational actor would engage in such machinations.  In the example described, a dedicated donor spent $500,000\xe2\x80\x94donating the full $5,000 to 100 different PACs\xe2\x80\x94to add just $26,000 to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s campaign coffers.  That same donor, meanwhile, could have spent unlimited funds on independent expenditures on behalf of Smith.  See Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9351.  Indeed, he could have spent his entire $500,000 advocating for Smith, without the risk that his selected PACs would choose not to give to Smith, or that he would have to share credit with other contributors to the PACs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have said in the context of independent expenditures that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Citizens United, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 47).  But probably not by 95 percent.  And at least from the donor\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, it strikes us as far more likely that he will want to see his full $500,000 spent on behalf of his favored candidate\xe2\x80\x94even if it must be spent independently\xe2\x80\x94rather than see it diluted to a small fraction so that it can be contributed directly by someone else.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother circumvention example is the one that apparently motivated the District Court.  As the District Court crafted the example, a donor gives a $500,000 check to a joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate, a national party committee, and \xe2\x80\x9cmost of the party\xe2\x80\x99s state party committees\xe2\x80\x9d (actually, 47 of the 50).  893 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 140.  The committees divide up the money so that each one receives the maximum contribution permissible under the base limits, but then each transfers its allocated portion to the same single committee.  That committee uses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate.  If that scenario \xe2\x80\x9cseem[s] unlikely,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court thought so, too.  Ibid.  But because the District Court could \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\xe2\x80\x9d that chain of events, it held that the example substantiated the Government\xe2\x80\x99s circumvention concerns.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne problem, however, is that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s speculation relies on illegal earmarking.  Lest there be any confusion, a joint fundraising committee is simply a mechanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively, not to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(5).  Under no circumstances may a contribution to a joint fundraising committee result in an allocation that exceeds the contribution limits applicable to its constituent parts; the committee is in fact required to return any excess funds to the contributor.  See \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(6)(i).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court assumed compliance with the specific allocation rules governing joint fundraising committees, but it expressly based its example on the premise that the donor would telegraph his desire to support one candidate and that \xe2\x80\x9cmany separate entities would willingly serve as conduits for a single contributor\xe2\x80\x99s interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  893 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 140.  Regardless whether so many distinct entities would cooperate as a practical matter, the earmarking provision prohibits an individual from directing funds \xe2\x80\x9cthrough an intermediary or conduit\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular candidate.  \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(8).  Even the \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d agreement imagined by the District Court, 893 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 140, would trigger the earmarking provision.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.6(b)(1).  So this circumvention scenario could not succeed without assuming that nearly 50 separate party committees would engage in a transparent violation of the earmarking rules (and that they would not be caught if they did).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the District Court failed to acknowledge that its $500,000 example cannot apply to most candidates.  It crafted the example around a presidential candidate, for whom donations in the thousands of dollars may not seem remarkable\xe2\x80\x94especially in comparison to the nearly $1.4 billion spent by the 2012 presidential candidates.  The same example cannot, however, be extrapolated to most House and Senate candidates.  Like contributions, coordinated expenditures are limited by statute, with different limits based on the State and the office.  See \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(d)(3).  The 2013 coordinated expenditure limit for most House races is $46,600, well below the $500,000 in coordinated expenditures envisioned by the District Court.  The limit for Senate races varies significantly based on state population.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 8531 (2013).  A scheme of the magnitude imagined by the District Court would be possible even in theory for no House candidates and the Senate candidates from just the 12 most populous States.

The Government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another State\xe2\x80\x99s candidates.  A review of FEC data of Republican and Democratic state party committees for the 2012 election cycle reveals just 12 total instances in which a state party committee contributed to a House or Senate candidate in another State.  No surprise there.  The Iowa Democratic Party, for example, has little reason to transfer money to the California Democratic Party, especially when the Iowa Democratic Party would be barred for the remainder of the election cycle from receiving another contribution for its own activities from the particular donor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese scenarios, along with others that have been suggested, are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or divorced from reality.  The three examples posed by the dissent are no exception.  The dissent does not explain how the large sums it postulates can be legally rerouted to a particular candidate, why most state committees would participate in a plan to redirect their donations to a candidate in another State, or how a donor or group of donors can avoid regulations prohibiting con- tributions to a committee \xe2\x80\x9cwith the knowledge that a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the contribution will support a candidate to whom the donor has already contributed, 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent argues that such knowledge may be difficult to prove, pointing to eight FEC cases that did not proceed because of insufficient evidence of a donor\xe2\x80\x99s incriminating knowledge.  See post, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  It might be that such guilty knowledge could not be shown because the donors were not guilty\xe2\x80\x94a possibility that the dissent does not entertain.  In any event, the donors described in those eight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the base limits by $5,000 or less.  The FEC\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find the requisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the agency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in which a donor routes millions of dollars in excess of the base limits to a particular candidate, as in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cExample Two.\xe2\x80\x9d  And if an FEC official cannot establish knowledge of circumvention (or establish affiliation) when the same ten donors contribute $10,000 each to 200 newly created PACs, and each PAC writes a $10,000 check to the same ten candidates\xe2\x80\x94the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cExample Three\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then that official has not a heart but a head of stone.

The dearth of FEC prosecutions, according to the dissent, proves only that people are getting away with it.  And the violations that surely must be out there elude detection \xe2\x80\x9cbecause in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex\xe2\x80\x9d than the hypothetical examples.

In this arena at least, charity begins at home.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBased on what we can discern from experience, the indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is disproportionate to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing circumvention.  The Government has not given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.  Absent such a showing, we cannot conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appropriately tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s anticircumvention interest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA final point: It is worth keeping in mind that the base limits themselves are a prophylactic measure.  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9crestrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Citizens United, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357.  The aggregate limits are then layered on top, ostensibly to prevent circumvention of the base limits.  This \xe2\x80\x9cprophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach\xe2\x80\x9d requires that we be particularly diligent in scrutinizing the law\xe2\x80\x99s fit.

Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe most obvious might involve targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees.  There are currently no such limits on transfers among party committees and from candidates to party committees.  See \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(4); 11 CFR \xc2\xa7113.2(c).  Perhaps for that reason, a central concern of the District Court, the Government, multiple amici curiae, and the dissent has been the ability of party committees to transfer money freely.  If Congress agrees that this is problematic, it might tighten its permissive transfer rules.  Doing so would impose a lesser burden on \n \nFirst Amendment rights, as compared to aggregate limits that flatly ban contributions beyond certain levels.  And while the Government has not conceded that transfer restrictions would be a perfect substitute for the aggregate limits, it has recognized that they would mitigate the risk of circumvention.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne possible option for restricting transfers would be to require contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients.  Such a solution would address the same circumvention possibilities as the current aggregate limits, while not completely barring contributions beyond the aggregate levels.  In addition (or as an alternative), if Congress believes that circumvention is especially likely to occur through creation of a joint fundraising committee, it could require that funds received through those committees be spent by their recipients (or perhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising committees).  Such alternatives to the aggregate limits properly refocus the inquiry on the delinquent actor: the recipient of a contribution within the base limits, who then routes the money in a manner that undermines those limits.  See Citizens United, supra, at 360\xe2\x80\x93361; cf. Bartnicki v. Vopper, \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 514\n\xe2\x80\x93530 (2001).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, Congress has adopted transfer restrictions, and the Court has upheld them, in the context of state party spending.  See \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441i(b).  So-called \xe2\x80\x9cLevin funds\xe2\x80\x9d are donations permissible under state law that may be spent on certain federal election activity\xe2\x80\x94namely, voter registration and identification, get-out-the-vote efforts, or generic campaign activities.  Levin funds are raised directly by the state or local party committee that ultimately spends them.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv).  That means that other party committees may not transfer Levin funds, solicit Levin funds on behalf of the particular state or local committee, or engage in joint fundraising of Levin funds.  See McConnell, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 171\xe2\x80\x93173.  McConnell upheld those transfer restrictions as \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiable anticircumvention measures,\xe2\x80\x9d though it acknowledged that they posed some associational burdens.  Id., at 171.  Here, a narrow transfer restriction on contributions that could otherwise be recontributed in excess of the base limits could rely on a similar justification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther alternatives might focus on earmarking.  Many of the scenarios that the Government and the dissent hy-pothesize involve at least implicit agreements to circumvent the base limits\xe2\x80\x94agreements that are already prohibited by the earmarking rules.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.6.  The FEC might strengthen those rules further by, for exam- ple, defining how many candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of a do- nor\xe2\x80\x99s contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate.  \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2).  Congress might also consider a modified version of the aggregate limits, such as one that prohibits donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed.  To be sure, the existing earmarking provision does not define \xe2\x80\x9cthe outer limit of accept- able tailoring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462.  But tighter rules could have a significant effect, especially when adopted in concert with other measures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not mean to opine on the validity of any particular proposal.  The point is that there are numerous al- ternative approaches available to Congress to prevent circumvention of the base limits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, disclosure of contributions minimizes the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system.  Disclosure requirements are in part \xe2\x80\x9cjustified based on a governmental interest in \xe2\x80\x98provid[ing] the electorate with information\xe2\x80\x99 about the sources of election-related spending.\xe2\x80\x9d  Citizens United, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 367 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 66).  They may also \xe2\x80\x9cdeter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 67.  Disclosure requirements burden speech, but\xe2\x80\x94unlike the aggregate limits\xe2\x80\x94they do not impose a ceiling on speech.  Citizens United, supra, at 366; but see McConnell, supra, at 275\xe2\x80\x93277 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  For that reason, disclosure often represents a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.  See, e.g., Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., \n\n479 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n262 (1986)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith modern technology, disclosure now offers a particularly effective means of arming the voting public with information.  In 1976, the Court observed that Congress could regard disclosure as \xe2\x80\x9conly a partial measure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 28.  That perception was understandable in a world in which information about campaign contributions was filed at FEC offices and was therefore virtually inaccessible to the average member of the public.  See Brief for Cause of Action Institute as Amicus Curiae 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Today, given the Internet, disclosure offers much more robust protections against corruption.  See Citizens United, supra, at 370\xe2\x80\x93371.  Reports and databases are availa- ble on the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s Web site almost immediately after they are filed, supplemented by private entities such as OpenSecrets.org and FollowTheMoney.org.  Because massive quantities of information can be accessed at the click of a mouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at the time Buckley, or even McConnell, was decided.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money away from entities subject to dis-closure.  Because individuals\xe2\x80\x99 direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech.  See Citizens United, supra, at 364.  Individuals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly disclose their donors.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76104(d)(3).  Such organizations spent some $300 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt oral argument, the Government shifted its focus from Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s anticircumvention rationale to an argument that the aggregate limits deter corruption regardless of their ability to prevent circumvention of the base limits.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330, 50\xe2\x80\x9352.  The Government argued that there is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large check is given to a legislator, even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be appropriately divided among numerous candidates and committees.  The aggregate limits, the argument goes, ensure that the check amount does not become too large.  That new rationale for the aggregate limits\xe2\x80\x94embraced by the dissent, see post, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317\xe2\x80\x94does not wash.  It dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articu- lated in our prior cases, and targets as corruption the general, broad-based support of a political party.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn analyzing the base limits, Buckley made clear that the risk of corruption arises when an individual makes large contributions to the candidate or officeholder himself.  See 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the aggregate limit under FECA was similarly confined.  The Court noted that the aggregate limit guarded against an individual\xe2\x80\x99s funneling\xe2\x80\x94through circumvention\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmassive amounts of money to a particular candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38 (emphasis added).  We have reiterated that understanding several times.  See, e.g., National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 497 (quid pro quo corruption occurs when \xe2\x80\x9c[e]lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 290, \n297 (1981)\n (Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s holding that contribution limits are permissible \xe2\x80\x9crelates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate\xe2\x80\x9d); McConnell, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 296 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)

But there is a clear, administrable line between money beyond the base limits funneled in an identifiable way to a candidate\xe2\x80\x94for which the candidate feels obligated\xe2\x80\x94and money within the base limits given widely to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party\xe2\x80\x94for which the candidate, like all other members of the party, feels grateful.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen donors furnish widely distributed support within all applicable base limits, all members of the party or supporters of the cause may benefit, and the leaders of the party or cause may feel particular gratitude.  That gratitude stems from the basic nature of the party system, in which party members join together to further common political beliefs, and citizens can choose to support a party because they share some, most, or all of those beliefs.  See Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., \n\n479 U.\xc2\xa0S. 208\n\xe2\x80\x93216 (1986).  To recast such shared interest, standing alone, as an opportunity for quid pro quo corruption would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.  Cf. California Democratic Party v. Jones, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 567\n\xe2\x80\x93573 (2000) (recognizing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crole to play in structuring and monitoring the election process,\xe2\x80\x9d but rejecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe proposition that party affairs are public affairs, free of \n \nFirst Amendment protections\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government suggests that it is the solicitation of large contributions that poses the danger of corruption, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330, 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 50\xe2\x80\x9351; see also post, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 20, but the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.

We have no occasion to consider a law that would specifically ban candidates from soliciting donations\xe2\x80\x94within the base limits\xe2\x80\x94that would go to many other candidates, and would add up to a large sum.

As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech to the electors of Bristol, a representative owes constituents the exercise of his \xe2\x80\x9cmature judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d but judgment informed by \xe2\x80\x9cthe strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 129\xe2\x80\x93130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).  Constituents have the right to support candidates who share their views and concerns.

To justify a lesser standard of review for contribution limits, Buckley relied on the premise that contributions are different in kind from direct expenditures.  None of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s bases for that premise withstands careful review.  The linchpin of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was its assertion that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 21.  But that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speech by proxy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rationale quickly breaks down, given that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven in the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that facilitates the dissemination of the spender\xe2\x80\x99s message\xe2\x80\x94for instance, an advertising agency or a television station.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colorado I, supra, at 638\xe2\x80\x93639 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

For example, Buckley claimed that contribution limits entail only a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal\xe2\x80\x9d speech restriction because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20, 21.  But this Court has never required a speaker to explain the reasons for his position in order to obtain full \n \nFirst Amendment protection.

Contributions do in- crease the quantity of communication by \xe2\x80\x9camplifying the voice of the candidate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chelp[ing] to ensure the dissemination of the messages that the contributor wishes to convey.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shrink Missouri, supra, at 415 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  They also serve as a quantifiable metric of the intensity of a particular contributor\xe2\x80\x99s support, as demonstrated by the frequent practice of giving different amounts to different candidates.

Instead, the plurality alludes only to Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s last remaining reason for devaluing political contributions relative to expenditures.

That is, the Government contends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long as an individual can still contribute some token amount (a dime, for example) to each of his preferred candidates.  The plurality, quite correctly, rejects that argument, noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16.  That is so because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat the plurality does not recognize is that the same logic also defeats the reasoning from Buckley on which the plurality purports to rely.  Under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, limiting the amount of money a person may give to a candidate does impose a direct restraint on his political communication; if it did not, the aggregate limits at issue here would not create \xe2\x80\x9ca special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  I am wholly in agreement with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion on this point: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Government may not penalize an individual for \xe2\x80\x98robustly exercis[ing]\xe2\x80\x99 his \n \nFirst Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 724, \n739 (2008)\n).  I regret only that the plurality does not acknowledge that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, although purporting not to overrule Buckley, continues to chip away at its footings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, what remains of Buckley is a rule without a rationale.  Contributions and expenditures are simply \xe2\x80\x9ctwo sides of the same \n \nFirst Amendment coin,\xe2\x80\x9d and our ef- forts to distinguish the two have produced mere \xe2\x80\x9cword games\xe2\x80\x9d rather than any cognizable principle of constitutional law.  Buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  For that reason, I would overrule Buckley and subject the aggregate limits in BCRA to strict scrutiny, which they would surely fail.  See Colorado I, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (opinion of Thomas, J.)

The limited, additional restriction on associa-tional freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday a majority of the Court overrules this holding.

Moreover, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prevent the \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cequally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d as narrowly defined.  Ante, at 19.  In the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, a federal statute could not prevent an individual from writing a million dollar check to a political party (by donating to its various committees), because the rationale for any limit would \xe2\x80\x9cdangerously broade[n] the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our prior cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 37.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis critically important definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d is inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior case law (with the possible exception of Citizens United, as I will explain below).  It is virtually impossible to reconcile with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in McConnell, upholding the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).  And it misun- derstands the constitutional importance of the interests at stake.  In fact, constitutional interests\xe2\x80\x94indeed, \n \nFirst Amendment interests\xe2\x80\x94lie on both sides of the legal equation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn reality, as the history of campaign finance reform shows and as our earlier cases on the subject have recognized, the anticorruption interest that drives Congress to regulate campaign contributions is a far broader, more important interest than the plurality acknowledges.

And it is an interest rooted in the Constitution and in the \n \nFirst Amendment itself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider at least one reason why the \n \nFirst Amendment protects political speech.  Speech does not exist in a vac- uum.  Rather, political communication seeks to secure government action.  A politically oriented \xe2\x80\x9cmarketplace of ideas\xe2\x80\x9d seeks to form a public opinion that can and will influence elected representatives.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not a new idea.  Eighty-seven years ago, Justice Brandeis wrote that the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection of speech was \xe2\x80\x9cessential to effective democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whitney v. California, \n\n274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 357, \n377 (1927)\n (concurring opinion).  Chief Justice Hughes reiterated the same idea shortly thereafter: \xe2\x80\x9cA fundamental principle of our constitutional system\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stromberg v. California, \n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359, \n369 (1931)\n (emphasis added).  In Citizens United, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Framers had good reason to emphasize this same connection between political speech and governmental action.  An influential 18th-century continental philosopher had argued that in a representative democracy, the people lose control of their representatives between elections, during which interim periods they were \xe2\x80\x9cin chains.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Rousseau, An Inquiry Into the Nature of the Social Contract 265\xe2\x80\x93266 (transl. 1791).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Framers responded to this criticism both by requiring frequent elections to federal office, and by enacting a \n \nFirst Amendment that would facilitate a \xe2\x80\x9cchain of communication between the people, and those, to whom they have committed the exercise of the powers of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Wilson, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States of America 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (1792).  This \xe2\x80\x9cchain\xe2\x80\x9d would establish the necessary \xe2\x80\x9ccommunion of interests and sympathy of sentiments\xe2\x80\x9d between the people and their representatives, so that public opinion could be channeled into effective governmental action.  The Federalist No. 57, p.\xc2\xa0386 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); accord, T. Benton, 1 Abridgement of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1856, p.\xc2\xa0141 (1857) (explaining that the \n \nFirst Amendment will strengthen American democracy by giving \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the people\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a right to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98publicly address their representatives,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98privately advise them,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting James Madison)).  Accordingly, the \n \nFirst Amendment advances not only the individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to engage in political speech, but also the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat has this to do with corruption?  It has everything to do with corruption.  Corruption breaks the constitutionally necessary \xe2\x80\x9cchain of communication\xe2\x80\x9d between the people and their representatives.  It derails the essential speech-to-government-action tie.  Where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard.  Insofar as corruption cuts the link between political thought and political action, a free marketplace of political ideas loses its point.  That is one reason why the Court has stressed the constitutional importance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of the many.  See, e.g., Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is also why the Court has used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubversion of the political process\xe2\x80\x9d to describe circumstances in which \xe2\x80\x9c[e]lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  NCPAC, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 497.

Rather, they are interests rooted in the \n \nFirst Amendment it- self.  They are rooted in the constitutional effort to create a democracy responsive to the people\xe2\x80\x94a government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and sentiments, the expression of which the \n \nFirst Amendment protects.  Given that end, we can and should understand campaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and more significant constitutional rationale than the plural- ity\xe2\x80\x99s limited definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d suggests.  We should see these laws as seeking in significant part to strengthen, rather than weaken, the \n \nFirst Amendment.  To say this is not to deny the potential for conflict between (1) the need to permit contributions that pay for the diffusion of ideas, and (2) the need to limit payments in order to help maintain the integrity of the electoral process.  But that conflict takes place within, not outside, the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSince the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link between public opinion and governmental action extend well beyond those the plurality describes, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s notion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic constitutional rationale I have just described.  Thus, it should surprise no one that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law (Citizens United excepted) insists upon a considerably broader definition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Buckley, for instance, the Court said explicitly that aggregate limits were constitutional because they helped \xe2\x80\x9cprevent evasion . . . [through] huge contributions to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s political party,\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26 (the contrary to what the plurality today seems to believe, see ante, at 36\xe2\x80\x9339).  Moreover, Buckley upheld the base limits in significant part because they helped thwart \xe2\x80\x9cthe appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 27 (emphasis added).  And it said that Congress could reasonably conclude that criminal laws forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cthe giving and taking of bribes\xe2\x80\x9d did not adequately \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with the reality or appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 28.  Bribery laws, the Court recognized, address \xe2\x80\x9conly the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

In Beaumont, for example, the Court found constitutional a ban on direct contributions by corporations because of the need to prevent corruption, properly \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood not only as quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence on an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v.

In Shrink Missouri, the Court upheld limitations imposed by the Missouri Legislature upon contributions to state political candidates, not only because of the need to prevent bribery, but also because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMost important, in McConnell, this Court considered the constitutionality of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, an Act that set new limits on \xe2\x80\x9csoft money\xe2\x80\x9d contributions to political parties.  \xe2\x80\x9cSoft money\xe2\x80\x9d referred to funds that, prior to BCRA, were freely donated to parties for activities other than directly helping elect a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x94activities such as voter registration, \xe2\x80\x9cget out the vote\xe2\x80\x9d drives, and advertising that did not expressly advocate a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x99s election or defeat.  540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122\xe2\x80\x93124.

What it showed, in detail, was the web of relationships and un- derstandings among parties, candidates, and large donors that underlies privileged access and influence.  See McConnell, 540 U.

But what the record did demonstrate was that enormous soft money contributions, ranging between $1 million and $5 million among the largest donors, enabled wealthy contributors to gain disproportionate \xe2\x80\x9caccess to federal lawmakers\xe2\x80\x9d and the ability to \xe2\x80\x9cinfluenc[e] legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 481 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).

That case is Citizens United.  There, as the plurality points out, ante, at 19, the Court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U. S., at 359.  Further, the Court said that quid pro quo corruption does not include \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence over or access to elected officials,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard \n \nFirst Amendment analyses.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

They are not essential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in the case\xe2\x80\x94at least insofar as it can be read to require federal law to treat corporations and trade unions like individuals when they independently pay for, e.g., television advertising during the last 60 days of a federal election.  Citizens United, supra, at 365.  Taken literally, the statements cited simply refer to and characterize still-earlier Court cases.  They do not require the more absolute reading that the plurality here gives them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore than that.  Read as the plurality reads them today, the statements from Citizens United about the proper contours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with language in the McConnell opinion, but with McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s very holding.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  Did the Court in Citizens United intend to overrule McConnell?  I doubt it, for if it did, the Court or certainly the dissent would have said something about it.  The total silence of all opinions in Citizens United with respect to this matter argues strongly in favor of treating the language quoted above as dic- tum, as an overstatement, or as limited to the context in which it appears.  Citizens United itself contains language that supports the last mentioned reading, for it says that \xe2\x80\x9c[Buckley] did not extend this rationale [about the reality or appearance of corruption] to independent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357 (emphasis added).  And it adds that, while \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called \xe2\x80\x98soft money,\xe2\x80\x99 were made to gain access to elected officials,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case, however, is about independent expenditures, not soft money.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality\xe2\x80\x99s use of Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s narrow definition of corruption here, however, is a different matter.  That use does not come accompanied with a limiting context (independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or limiting language.  It applies to the whole of campaign finance regulation.  And, as I have pointed out, it is flatly inconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon which McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s holding depends.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo: Does the Court intend today to overrule McConnell?  Or does it intend to leave McConnell and BCRA in place?  The plurality says the latter.  Ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, n.\xc2\xa06 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not overrule McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s holding about \xe2\x80\x98soft money\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But how does the plurality explain its rejection of the broader definition of corruption, upon which McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s holding depends?  Compare ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321, with McConnell, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146, 149\xe2\x80\x93153. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution limits for a second reason.  It believes they are no longer needed to prevent contributors from circumventing federal limits on direct contributions to individuals, political parties, and political action committees.  Ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9329.  Cf. Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38 (aggregate limits \xe2\x80\x9cprevent evasion\xe2\x80\x9d of base contribution limits).  Other \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign finance laws,\xe2\x80\x9d combined with \xe2\x80\x9cexperience\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense,\xe2\x80\x9d foreclose the various circumvention scenarios that the Government hypothesizes.  Ante, at 28.  Accordingly, the plurality concludes, the aggregate limits provide no added benefit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality is wrong.  Here, as in Buckley, in the absence of limits on aggregate political contributions, donors can and likely will find ways to  channel millions of dollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing precisely the kind of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d that previously led the Court to hold aggregate limits constitutional.  Those opportunities for circumvention will also produce the type of corruption that concerns the plurality today.  The methods for using today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to evade the law\xe2\x80\x99s individual contribution limits are complex, but they are well known, or will become well known, to party fundraisers.  I shall describe three.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExample One: Gifts for the Benefit of the Party.  Campaign finance law permits each individual to give $64,800 over two years to a national party committee.  \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532 (2013).  The two major political parties each have three national committees.  Ante, at 4, n.\xc2\xa01.  Federal law also entitles an individual to give $20,000 to a state party committee over two years.  \xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(D).  Each major political party has 50 such committees.  Those individual limits mean that, in the absence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally give to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party about $1.2 million over two years.  See Appendix B, Table 1, infra, at 39.  To make it easier for contributors to give gifts of this size, each party could create a \xe2\x80\x9cJoint Party Committee,\xe2\x80\x9d comprising all of its national and state party committees.  The titular heads could be the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House.  A contributor could then write a single check to the Joint Party Committee\xe2\x80\x94and its staff would divide the funds so that each constituent unit receives no more than it could obtain from the contributor directly ($64,800 for a national committee over two years, $20,000 for a state committee over the same).  Before today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the total size of Rich Donor\xe2\x80\x99s check to the Joint Party Committee was capped at $74,600\xe2\x80\x94the aggregate limit for donations to political parties over a 2-year election cycle.  See \xc2\xa7441a(a)(3)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532.  After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, Rich Donor can write a single check to the Joint Party Committee in an amount of about $1.2 million.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWill political parties seek these large checks?  Why not? The recipient national and state committees can spend the money to buy generic party advertisements, say television commercials or bumper stickers saying \xe2\x80\x9cSupport Republicans,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSupport Democrats,\xe2\x80\x9d or the like.  They also can transfer the money to party committees in battleground States to increase the chances of winning hotly contested seats.  See \xc2\xa7441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state po- litical committees to make unlimited \xe2\x80\x9ctransfers\xe2\x80\x9d to other committees \xe2\x80\x9cof the same political party\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWill party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy donors?  Absolutely.  Such con- tributions will help increase the party\xe2\x80\x99s power, as well as the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s standing among his colleagues.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWill elected officials be particularly grateful to the large donor, feeling obliged to provide him special access and influence, and perhaps even a quid pro quo legislative favor?  That is what we have previously believed.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 182 (\xe2\x80\x9cLarge soft-money donations at a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s or officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 308 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment\xe2\x80\x9d); Colorado II, 533 U.

And, as the statements collected in Appendix A, infra, make clear, we have believed this with good reason.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExample Two: Donations to Individual Candidates (The $3.6 Million Check).  The first example significantly understates the problem.  That is because federal election law also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each party candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the candidate is running in both a primary and a general election).  \xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(A); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532.  There are 435 party candidates for House seats and 33 party candidates for Senate seats in any given election year.  That makes an additional $2.4 million in allowable contributions.  Thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will permit a wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year election cycle, for $3.6 million\xe2\x80\x94all to benefit his political party and its candidates.  See Appendix B, Table 2(a), infra, at 39.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contribution of this size, the parties can simply enlarge the composition of the Joint Party Committee described in Example One, so that it now includes party candidates.  And a party can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps calling the first the \xe2\x80\x9cSmith Victory Committee,\xe2\x80\x9d the second the \xe2\x80\x9cJones Victory Committee,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(5) (2012).  (I say \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x9d because too transparent a name might call into play certain earmarking rules.  But the Federal Election Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (FEC) database of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows similarly named entities, e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cLandrieu Wyden Victory Fund,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs I have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law will allow Rich Donor to write a single check to, say, the Smith Victory Committee, for up to $3.6 million.  This check represents \xe2\x80\x9cthe total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants\xe2\x80\x9d in the Committee over a 2-year cycle.  \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(5).  The Committee would operate under an agreement that provides a \xe2\x80\x9cfor- mula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds\xe2\x80\x9d among its constituent units.  \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(1).  And that \xe2\x80\x9cformula\xe2\x80\x9d would divide the proceeds so that no committee or can- didate receives more than it could have received from Rich Donor directly\xe2\x80\x94$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200.  See \xc2\xa7102.17(c)(6).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo what is wrong with that?  The check is considerably larger than Example One\xe2\x80\x99s check.  But is there anything else wrong?  The answer is yes, absolutely.  The law will also permit a party and its candidates to shift most of Rich Donor\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to a single candidate, say Smith. Here is how:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe law permits each candidate and each party committee in the Smith Victory Committee to write Candidate Smith a check directly.  For his primary and general elections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000 (from each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s authorized campaign committee) and $10,000 (from each state and national committee).  2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7432(e)(3)(B), 441a(a)(2)(A); 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.3(b).  This yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus $530,000 (from party committees).  Thus, the law permits the candidates and party entities to redirect $2.37 million of Rich Donor\xe2\x80\x99s $3.6 million check to Candidate Smith.  It also permits state and national committees to contribute to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s general election campaign through making coordinated expenditures\xe2\x80\x94in amounts that range from $46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election (depending upon the size of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s State and whether he is running for a House or Senate seat).  78 Fed. Reg. 8530\xe2\x80\x938532.  See Appendix B, Table 2(b), infra, at 40.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that Candidate Smith can receive at least $2.37 million and possibly the full $3.6 million contributed by Rich Donor to the Smith Victory Committee, even though the funds must first be divided up among the constituent units before they can be rerouted to Smith.  Nothing requires the Smith Victory Committee to explain in advance to Rich Donor all of the various transfers that will take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the Committee from informing the donor and the receiving candidate after the fact what has transpired.  Accordingly, the money can be donated and rerouted to Candidate Smith without the donor having violated the base limits or any other FEC regulation.  And the evidence in the McConnell record reprinted in Appendix A, infra\xe2\x80\x94with respect to soft money contributions\xe2\x80\x94makes clear that Candidate Smith will almost certainly come to learn from whom he has received this money.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties can apply the same procedure to other large donations, channeling money from Rich Donor Two to Candidate Jones.  If 10 or 20 candidates face particularly tight races, party committees and party candidates may work together to channel Rich Donor One\xe2\x80\x99s multimillion dollar contribution to the Most Embattled Candidate (e.g., Candidate Smith), Rich Donor Two\xe2\x80\x99s multimillion dollar contribution to the Second Most Embattled Candidate (e.g., Candidate Jones), and so on down the line.  If this does not count as evasion of the base limits, what does?  Present aggregate limits confine the size of any individual gift to $123,200.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion creates a loophole measured in the millions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExample Three: Proliferating Political Action Commit-tees (PACs).  Campaign finance law prohibits an individual from contributing (1) more than $5,200 to any candidate in a federal election cycle, and (2) more than $5,000 to a PAC in a calendar year.  2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(A), (C); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532.  It also prohibits (3) any PAC from contributing more than $10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle.  \xc2\xa7441(a)(2)(A).  But the law does not prohibit an individual from contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual aggregate limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total number of PACs.  And there, so to speak, lies the rub.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will be able to channel $2 million from each of ten Rich Do- nors to each of ten Embattled Candidates.  Groups of party supporters\xe2\x80\x94individuals, corporations, or trade unions\xe2\x80\x94create 200 PACs.  Each PAC claims it will use the funds it raises to support several candidates from the party, though it will favor those who are most endangered.  (Each PAC qualifies for \xe2\x80\x9cmulticandidate\xe2\x80\x9d status because it has received contributions from more than 50 persons and has made contributions to five federal candidates  at some point previously.  \xc2\xa7441a(a)(4); 11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.5(e)(3)).  Over a 2-year election cycle, Rich Donor One gives $10,000 to each PAC ($5,000 per year)\xe2\x80\x94yielding $2 million total.  Rich Donor 2 does the same.  So, too, do the other eight Rich Donors.  This brings their total donations to $20 million, disbursed among the 200 PACs.  Each PAC will have collected $100,000, and each can use its money to write ten checks of $10,000\xe2\x80\x94to each of the ten most Embattled Candidates in the party (over two years).  See Appendix B, Table 3, infra, at 41.  Every Embattled Candidate, receiving a $10,000 check from 200 PACs, will have collected $2 million.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that ten Rich Donors will have contrib- uted $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates will have collected $2 million each.  In this example, unlike Example Two, the recipient candidates may not know which of the ten Rich Donors is personally responsible for the $2 million he or she receives.  But the recipient candidate is highly likely to know who the ten Rich Donors are, and to feel appropriately grateful.  Moreover, the ability of a small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to threatened candidates is not insignificant.  In the example above\xe2\x80\x94with ten Rich Donors giving $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates receiving $2 million each\xe2\x80\x94the contributions would have been enough to finance a considerable portion of, and perhaps all of, the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 races in the 2012 elections.  See Appendix C, Table 1, infra, at 42 (showing that in 2012, the average winning House candidate spent $1.6 million and the average winning Senate candidate spent $11.5 million).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality believes that the three scenarios I have just depicted either pose no threat, or cannot or will not take place.  It does not believe the scenario depicted in Example One is any cause for concern, because it involves only \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral, broad-based support of a political party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 37.  Not so.  A candidate who solicits a multimillion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the checkwriter, and surely could reward him with a quid pro quo favor.

Hence, it concludes, there is no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits.  See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, 22\xe2\x80\x9329.  But a closer examination of the five legal changes to which the plurality points makes clear that those changes cannot effectively stop the abuses that I have depicted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the plurality points out that in 1976 (a few months after this Court decided Buckley) Congress \xe2\x80\x9cadded limits on contributions to political committees,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., to PACs.  Ante, at 11; accord, \n\n90Stat.\n487 (codified at \n\n2 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(C)).  But Example Three, the here-relevant example, takes account of those limits, namely, $5,000 to a PAC in any given year.  And it shows that the per-PAC limit does not matter much when it comes to the potential for circumvention, as long as party supporters can create dozens or hundreds of PACs.  Federal law places no upper limit on the number of PACs supporting a party or a group of party candidates that can be established.  And creating a PAC is primarily a matter of paperwork, a knowledgeable staff person, and a little time.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the plurality points out that in 1976, Congress \xe2\x80\x9calso added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  The rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9call contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled\xe2\x80\x9d by the same corporation, labor organization, person, or group of persons, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be considered to have been made by a single political committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7441a(a)(5).  But different supporters can create different PACs.  Indeed, there were roughly 2,700 \xe2\x80\x9cnonconnected\xe2\x80\x9d PACs (i.e., PACs not connected to a spe- cific corporation or labor union) operating during the 2012 elections.  Ante, at 24.  In a future without aggregate contribution limits, far more nonconnected PACs will likely appear.  The plurality also notes that the FEC can examine certain \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98circumstantial factors,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common or overlapping membership\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98similar patterns of contributions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether a group of PACs are  affiliated.  Ante, at 25 (quoting 11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.5(g)(4)(ii)).   But the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is whether \xe2\x80\x9cone committee or organization [has] been established, financed, maintain or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Just because a group of multicandidate PACs all support the same party and all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered candidates in that party does not mean they will qualify as \xe2\x80\x9caffiliated\xe2\x80\x9d under the relevant definition.  This rule appears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention depicted in Example Three.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the plurality says that a post-Buckley regulation has strengthened the statute\xe2\x80\x99s earmarking provision.  Ante, at 12.  Namely, the plurality points to a rule pro- mulgated by the FEC in 1976, specifying that earmarking includes any \xe2\x80\x9cdesignation \xe2\x80\x98whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or written.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.6(b)); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35950 (1976).  This means that if Rich Donor were to give $5,000 to a PAC while \xe2\x80\x9cdesignat[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d (in any way) that the money go to Candidate Smith, those funds must count towards Rich Donor\xe2\x80\x99s total allowable contributions to Smith\xe2\x80\x94$5,200 per election cycle.  But the virtually identical earmarking provision in effect when this Court decided Buckley would have required the same thing.  That provision also counted, when applying the base contribution limits, \xe2\x80\x9call contri- butions made by a person, either directly or indirectly, on behalf of a particular candidate, including contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n88Stat.\n1264; accord, \n\n2 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(8) (same).  What is the difference?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the plurality points out that the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations \xe2\x80\x9cspecify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate committee may not also contribute to a single-candidate committee for that candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (citing 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(1); emphasis added).  The regulations, however, do not prevent a person who has contributed to a candidate from also contributing to multicandidate committees that support the candidate.  Indeed, the rules specifically authorize such contributions. See \xc2\xa7110.1(h) (\xe2\x80\x9cA person may contribute to a candidate . . . and also contribute to a political committee which has sup- ported, or anticipates supporting, the same candidate in the same election,\xe2\x80\x9d as long as the political committee is \xe2\x80\x9cnot the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s principal campaign committee\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9csingle candidate committee\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Example Three illustrates the latter kind of contribution.  And briefs before us make clear that the possibility for circumventing the base limits through making such contributions is a realistic, not an illusory, one.  See Brief for Appellee 36 (demonstrating that many PACs today explain in their public materials just what fairly small group of candidates they intend to support); Brief for Americans for Campaign Reform as Amicus Curiae 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (similar).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFifth, the plurality points to another FEC regulation (also added in 1976), which says that \xe2\x80\x9can individual who has contributed to a candidate\xe2\x80\x9d may not \xe2\x80\x9calso contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate if the individual knows that \xe2\x80\x98a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,\xe2\x80\x99 that candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d Ante, at 13 (quoting 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2); brackets in original); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35948.  This regulation is important, for in principle, the FEC might use it to prevent the circumstances that Examples Two and Three set forth from arising.  And it is not surprising that the plurality relies upon the existence of this rule when it describes those circumstances as \xe2\x80\x9cimplausible,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cillegal,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdivorced from reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 23, 24, 28.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti-circumvention weapon that the plurality imagines.  Despite the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s assurances, it does not \xe2\x80\x9cdisarm\xe2\x80\x9d the possibilities for circumvention.  Ante, at 23.  That is because the regulation requires a showing that donors have \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge that a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of their contributions will be used by a PAC to support a candidate to whom they have already contributed.  \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2) (emphasis added).  And \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d is hard to prove.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI have found nine FEC cases decided since the year 2000 that refer to this regulation.  In all but one, the FEC failed to find the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94despite the presence of Example Two or Example Three circumstances.  See Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: Transfund PAC, Matter Under Review (MUR) 6221, p.\xc2\xa011 (FEC, June 7, 2010) (although the donor \xe2\x80\x9cmight reasonably infer that some portion of his contribution\xe2\x80\x9d to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership PAC would be used to support the candidate, \xe2\x80\x9csuch an inference alone does not suggest that [he] had \xe2\x80\x98actual knowledge\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of such); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: John Shadegg\xe2\x80\x99s Friends, MUR 5968, pp. 3, 6\xe2\x80\x937 (FEC, Nov. 10, 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no basis on which to conclude that [the donors] knew that the funds they contributed to LEAD PAC would be used to support the Shadegg Committee\xe2\x80\x9d even though Congressman Shadegg solicited the donations and LEAD PAC was Congressman Shadegg\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership PAC); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: Walberg for Congress, MUR 5881, pp. 6, 9\xe2\x80\x9311 (FEC, Aug. 15, 2007) (finding seven contributors, who gave to a candidate and to a PAC that provided 86% of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s financing, had not shown \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: Matt Brown for Senate, MUR 5732, p. 11 (FEC, Apr. 4, 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThough it may be reasonable to infer that the individual donors solicited by Brown gave to the State Parties under the assumption that some portion of their contribution might then be donated to the Brown Committee, such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to believe 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h) has been violated\xe2\x80\x9d); First General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Report, In re: Liffrig for Senate, MUR 5678, pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (FEC, Nov. 27, 2006) (similar); First General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Report, In re: Nesbitt, MUR 5445, pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (FEC, Feb. 2, 2005) (similar); First General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Report, In\xc2\xa0re: Keystone Corp., MUR 5019, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9329 (FEC, Feb. 5, 2001) (similar); General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Report #2,  In\xc2\xa0re: Boston Capital Corp., MUR 4538, pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (FEC, Mar. 10, 2000) (recommending the FEC take no action with respect to the \xc2\xa7110.1(h) issue).  Given this record of FEC (in)activity, my reaction to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon agency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aggregate limits) is like Oscar Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s after reading Dickens\xe2\x80\x99 account of the death of Little Nell: \xe2\x80\x9cOne must have a heart of stone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilde, \xe2\x80\x9cto read [it] without laughing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations 86 (N.

Ante, at 25 (citing Conciliation Agreement, In re Riley, MURs 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19, 2001)).  In that case, the FEC found prob- able cause to believe that three individual contributors to several PACs had the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that the PACs would use a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of their contributions to support a candidate to whom they had already contributed\xe2\x80\x94Sam Brownback, a candidate for the Senate (for two of the contributors), and Robert Riley, a candidate for the House (for the third).  The individuals had made donations to several PACs operating as a network, under the direction of a single political consulting firm.  The two contributors to Sam Brownback were his parents-in-law, and the FEC believed they might be using the PAC network to channel extra support to him.  The contributor to Robert Riley was his son, and the FEC believed he might be doing the same.  The facts in this case are unusual, for individ- ual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates they are seeking to support, and ordinary PACs do not tend to work in coordination under the direction of a con-sulting firm.  In any event, this single swallow cannot make the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s summer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, it is not surprising that throughout the many years this FEC regulation has been in effect, political parties and candidates have established ever more joint fundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last federal elections); candidates have established ever more \xe2\x80\x9cLeadership PACs\xe2\x80\x9d (numbering over 450 in the last elections); and party supporters have established ever more multicandidate PACs (numbering over 3,000 in the last elections).  See Appendix C, Tables 2\xe2\x80\x933, infra, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343; FEC, 2014 Committee Summary (reporting the number of \xe2\x80\x9cqualified\xe2\x80\x9d (or multicandidate) PACs in 2012), online at http://www.fec.gov/data/CommitteeSummary.do (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 28, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUsing these entities, candidates, parties, and party supporters can transfer and, we are told, have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates, thereby avoiding the base contribution limits in ways that Examples Two and Three help demonstrate.  See Brief for Appellee 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 53\xe2\x80\x9354; Brief for Campaign Legal Center, et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 12\xe2\x80\x9315;  Brief of Democratic Members of the United States House of Representatives as Amici Curiae 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  They have done so without drawing FEC prosecution\xe2\x80\x94at least not according to my (and apparently the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s) search of publicly available records.  That is likely because in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex than our stylized Examples Two and Three depict.  And persons have used these entities to channel money to candidates without any individual breaching the current aggregate $123,200 limit.  The plurality now removes that limit, thereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate contributions not of $123,200, but of several millions of dollars.  If the FEC regulation has failed to plug a small hole, how can it possibly plug a large one?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality concludes that even if circumvention were a threat, the aggregate limits are \xe2\x80\x9cpoorly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to ad- dress it.  Ante, at 30.  The \n \nFirst Amendment requires \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a fit that is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasonable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and there is no such \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d here because there are several alternative ways Congress could prevent evasion of the base limits.  Ibid. (quoting Fox, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 480).  For instance, the plurality posits, Congress (or the FEC) could \xe2\x80\x9ctighten .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. transfer rules\xe2\x80\x9d; it could require \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients\xe2\x80\x9d; it could define \xe2\x80\x9chow many candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure that \xe2\x80\x98a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x99 of a donor\xe2\x80\x99s contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate\xe2\x80\x9d; or it could prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cdonors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 33\xe2\x80\x9335 (quoting 11 CFR \xc2\xa7110.1(h)(2)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality, however, does not show, or try to show, that these hypothetical alternatives could effectively replace aggregate contribution limits.  Indeed, it does not even \xe2\x80\x9copine on the validity of any particular proposal,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 35\xe2\x80\x94presumably because these proposals themselves could be subject to constitutional challenges.  For the most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions were similarly available at the time of Buckley.  Their hypothetical presence did not prevent the Court from upholding aggregate limits in 1976.  How can their continued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to conclude that aggregate limits are \xe2\x80\x9cpoorly tailored?\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 30.  How can their continued hypothetical presence lead the Court to overrule Buckley now?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, the explanation of why aggregate limits are needed is complicated, as is the explanation of why other methods will not work.  But the conclusion is simple: There is no \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial mismatch\xe2\x80\x9d between Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate objective and the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans selected to achieve it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.

See 893 F. Supp. 2d 133, 140\xe2\x80\x93141 (DC 2012).  If the plurality now believes the District Court was wrong, then why does it not return the case for the further evidentiary development which has not yet taken place?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the past, when evaluating the constitutionality of campaign finance restrictions, we have typically relied upon an evidentiary record amassed below to determine whether the law served a compelling governmental objective.  And, typically, that record contained testimony from Members of Congress (or state legislators) explaining why Congress (or the legislature) acted as it did.  See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 147\xe2\x80\x93154 (upholding federal restrictions on soft money by drawing on an extensive District Court record that contained declarations from current and former Members of Congress); Colorado II, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 457\xe2\x80\x93465 (upholding federal limits on coordinated expenditures between parties and candidates on the basis of a summary judgment record that contained declarations from party operatives, fundraisers, and Members of Congress); Shrink Missouri, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393 (upholding Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits on the basis of the lower court record, which contained similar declarations).  If we are to overturn an act of Congress here, we should do so on the basis of a similar record.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, an evidentiary record can help us determine whether or the extent to which we should defer to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 own judgments, particularly those reflecting a balance of the countervailing \n \nFirst Amendment interests I have described.  Determining whether anticorruption objectives justify a particular set of contribution limits requires answering empirically based questions, and ap- plying significant discretion and judgment.  To what extent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its appearance?  What forms will any such corruption take?  To what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public confidence in the democratic system?  To what extent can regulation restore it?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are questions that Congress is far better suited to resolve than are judges.  Thus, while court review of contribution limits has been and should be \xe2\x80\x9crigorous,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckley, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 29, we have also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cdeference to legislative choice is warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Beaumont, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 155.  And that deference has taken account of facts and circumstances set forth in an evidentiary record.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, a comparison of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with this dissent reveals important differences of opinion on fact-related matters.  We disagree, for example, on the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in the absence of aggregate limits.  We disagree about how effectively the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9calternatives\xe2\x80\x9d could prevent evasion.  An evidentiary proceeding would permit the parties to explore these matters, and it would permit the courts to reach a more accurate judgment.  The plurality rationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties have treated the question as a purely legal one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14, n.\xc2\xa0 4.  But without a doubt, the legal question\xe2\x80\x94whether the aggregate limits are closely drawn to further a compelling governmental inter-est\xe2\x80\x94turns on factual questions about whether corruption, in the absence of such limits, is a realistic threat to our democracy.  The plurality itself spends pages citing figures about campaign spending to defend its \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion.  Ante, at 24\xe2\x80\x9326, 27\xe2\x80\x9328, 30\xe2\x80\x9332.  The problem with such reasoning is that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s expertise does not lie in marshaling facts in the primary instance.

The threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real.  Part III, supra.  Even taking the plurality on its own terms and considering solely the threat of quid pro quo corruption (i.e., money-for-votes exchanges), the aggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumvention.  Ibid.  And there is no basis for finding a lack of \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d between the threat and the means used to combat it, namely the aggregate limits.
