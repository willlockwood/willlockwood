ESPARZA<br/>\n540 U. S. ____ (2003)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">BETTY MITCHELL, WARDEN <em>v.</em> GREGORY ESPARZA</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 02\xe2\x80\x931369. Decided November 3, 2003</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the Eighth Amendment requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claims to harmless-error review.  310 F.\xc2\xa03d 414 (2002).  This decision ignores the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, \xc2\xa72911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Esparza</em>, 39 Ohio St. 3d 8, 529 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 192 (1988), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/1012/index.html">490 U. S. 1012</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.  Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal offender.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender.  Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation \xe2\x80\x98principal offender.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Esparza</em>, No. L\xe2\x80\x9390\xe2\x80\x93235, 1992 WL 113827, *9 (May 29, 1992), cause dism\xe2\x80\x99d, 65 Ohio St. 3d 1453, 602 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 250 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent then filed a second petition for state postconviction relief alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because his attorney did not argue that the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with its sentencing procedures violated the Eighth Amendment.  The Ohio Court of Appeals in a conclusory opinion denied his claim, referring back to its previous decision.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Esparza</em>, No. L\xe2\x80\x9384\xe2\x80\x93224, 1994 WL 395114, *5 (July 27, 1994), cause dism\xe2\x80\x99d, 70 Ohio St. 3d 1473, 640 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 845 (Ohio 1994).  The import of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudiced because any error committed by counsel was harmless.  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cThe state court \xe2\x80\xa6 determined that since [respondent] was the only individual charged, the jury must have determined that [respondent] was the principal offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having exhausted his avenues for relief under state law, respondent filed a habeas petition in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The District Court concluded that the Ohio Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because it was contrary to our opinions in <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/275/index.html">508 U. S. 275</a> (1993).  In light of this error, as well as others not relevant to this opinion, the court granted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition in part and issued a writ of habeas corpus as to the death sentence.  <em>Esparza </em>v.<em> Anderson</em>, No. 3:96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x937434 (Oct. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a\xe2\x80\x93240a.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, holding that the Eighth Amendment precluded respondent\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate.  The State of Ohio petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we now grant, along with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A federal court may grant a state habeas petitioner relief for a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if that adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals, however, failed to cite, much less apply, this section.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d our clearly established law if it \xe2\x80\x9capplies a rule that contradicts the \xc2\xa0governing law set forth in our cases\xe2\x80\x9d or if it \xe2\x80\x9cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 405\xe2\x80\x93406 (2000); see also <em>Price</em> v. <em>Vincent</em>, 538 U. S. ___, ___ (2003) (slip op., at 5); <em>Early</em> v. <em>Packer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/3/index.html">537 U. S. 3</a>, 7\xe2\x80\x938 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  A state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d simply because the court did not cite our opinions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 8.  We have held that a state court need not even be aware of our precedents, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Sixth Circuit, Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s failure to charge in the indictment that respondent was a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d was the functional equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cdispensing with the reasonable doubt requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  310 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 421 (citing <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 280).  Our precedents, however, do not support its conclusion.  In noncapital cases, we have often held that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense is subject to harmless-error analysis.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 19 (1999); <em>California</em> v. <em>Roy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/2/index.html">519 U. S. 2</a> (1996) <em>(per</em>\xc2\xa0<em>curiam);</em> <em>Carella</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/263/index.html">491 U. S. 263</a>, 266 (1989) <em>(per</em>\xc2\xa0<em>curiam);</em> <em>Pope</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/497/index.html">481 U. S. 497</a> (1987).  In <em>Neder</em>, for example, we held that such an error \xe2\x80\x9cdiffers markedly from the constitutional violations we have found to defy harmless-error review.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 8.  In so holding, we explicitly distinguished <em>Sullivan</em> because the error in <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x94the failure to instruct the jury that the State must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vitiate[d] <em>all</em> the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 527 U. S., at 11, whereas, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to instruct the jury on one element of an offense did not, see <em>id.</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  Where the jury was precluded from determining only one element of an offense, we held that harmless-error review is feasible.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot say that because the violation occurred in the context of a capital sentencing proceeding that our precedent requires the opposite result.  Indeed, a number of our harmless-error cases have involved capital defendants,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U. S. 279</a>, 310 (1991) (unconstitutional admission of coerced confession at guilt stage); <em>Clemons</em> v. <em>Mississippi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/738/index.html">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990) (unconstitutionally broad jury instructions at sentencing stage); <em>Satterwhite</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/249/index.html">486 U. S. 249</a> (1988) (unconstitutional admission of evidence at sentencing stage), and we left a question similar to the one presented here open in another capital case, <em>Ring</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/584/index.html">536 U. S. 584</a>, 609, n.\xc2\xa07 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not reach the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that any error was harmless because a pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In relying on the absence of precedent to distinguish our noncapital cases, and to hold that harmless-error review is not available for this type of Eighth Amendment claim, the Sixth Circuit exceeded its authority under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  A federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own, when the precedent from this Court is, at best, ambiguous.  As the Ohio Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision does not conflict with the reasoning or the holdings of our precedent, it is not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question then becomes whether the Ohio Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination is an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable <em>application</em> of clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added; punctuation omitted.)  A constitutional error is harmless when \xe2\x80\x9cit appears \xe2\x80\x98beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 15 (quoting <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/index.html">386 U. S. 18</a>, 24 (1967)); see also <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Van Arsdall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/index.html">475 U. S. 673</a>, 681 (1986).  We may not grant respondent\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, however, if the state court simply erred in concluding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s errors were harmless; rather, habeas relief is appropriate only if the Ohio Court of Appeals applied harmless-error review in an \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d manner.  <em>Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U. S. 63</a>, 75\xe2\x80\x9377 (2003); see also <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U.

The Ohio Supreme Court has defined a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98principal offender\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the actual killer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State</em> v. <em>Chinn</em>, 85 Ohio St. 3d 548, 559, 709 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1166, 1177 (1999), and in this case, the jury was instructed on the elements of aggravated murder, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98defined as purposely causing the death of another while committing Aggravated Robbery,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 310 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 432 (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting).  The trial judge further instructed the jury that it must determine \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense of Aggravated Murder was committed while the Defendant was committing Aggravated Robbery.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In light of these instructions, the jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d in the offense.  After all, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment.  There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Cf. <em>Neder</em>, 527 U. S., at 19 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here a defendant did not, and apparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted element, answering the question whether the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error does not fundamentally undermine the purposes of the jury trial guarantee\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that respondent was convicted of a capital offense was objectively unreasonable.  That being the case, we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Ohio Rev.

In <em>Presnell</em>, we held that the Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a death sentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, even though the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was never submitted to a jury.  <em>Presnell</em>, however, relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals noted evidence brought to light for the first time in the habeas proceeding in the District Court that suggested there might have been another participant in the crime, Joe Jasso.
