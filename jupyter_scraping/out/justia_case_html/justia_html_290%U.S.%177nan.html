S. 178</a></p><p></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>This suit was brought by respondent, Field Packing Company, against the State Tax Commission of Kentucky and its members to restrain the enforcement of that part of Chapter 158 of the Acts of the 1932 Session of the General Assembly of Kentucky which imposed a tax of 10 cents per pound on all oleomargarine sold within the state.  The statute was assailed as being in violation of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the state and of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  The District Court, composed of three judges (28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 380) granted an interlocutory injunction and, on final hearing, entered a decree making the injunction permanent.</p>\n<p>The District Court held that the statute, although in the form of a taxing law, was in reality a prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine in Kentucky, and hence was invalid under the state constitution.  The question presented under the Federal Constitution was not decided.  <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.
