The Circuit Court for Baltimore County dismissed the charges, concluding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. [ Randall Book Corporation v. Maryland <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/919/case.html">464 U.S. 919</a> (1983) ][919-Continued.] </p><p> On the State\'s appeal, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed . The court, relying on Smiley v. State, 294 Md. 461, 450 A.2d 909 (1982), concluded that the statute is constitutional and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In Smiley, the Maryland Court of Appeals construed the statute to prohibit only "obscene material," which this Court has held is unprotected by the First Amendment. See Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#23">413 U.S. 15, 23</a>, 2614 (1973). </p><p> In my view, the statute is unconstitutional on its face, notwithstanding the state court\'s limiting construction. I continue to believe that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly \'obscene\' contents."

Ferber, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 3364 (1982) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment). </p><p> Since a criminal trial of petitioner under this statute will in my view violate the Constitution of the United States, it is clear that " identifiable . . . constitutional polic[y]" will be "undermined by the continuation of the litigation in the state courts."
