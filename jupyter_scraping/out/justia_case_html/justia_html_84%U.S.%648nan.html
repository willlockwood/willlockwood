By this act and a supplement to it passed in 1864, the defendants were authorized to take possession of and hold the bay which lies along the waterfront of the City and County of San Francisco and adjacent thereto to the extent of six hundred feet, with the privileges and appurtenances, except such portions as were held under valid leases, and of those portions when the leases expired, and to construct a street along the line of the waterfront and wharves, docks, and other improvements intended for the convenience of shipping and commerce.

JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>The alcaldes of the pueblo of San Francisco possessed no authority to grant any lands covered by the tidewaters of the bay.  The grants, therefore, under which the plaintiff claims were inoperative to pass any title to the premises.  This is admitted by counsel on both sides, and the only question presented by the record for our determination is whether the grants were confirmed by the Act of the legislature of May 14, 1861.</p>\n<p>That question is not an open one for this Court.  It has received its authoritative solution by the judgment of the supreme court of the state.  In the case of <em>People v. Davidson,</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the question arose in that court whether the premises, upon which the defendants there had constructed a wharf, which were the same premises in controversy here, belonged to the defendants, who claimed them under the same alcalde grants and the same act of the legislature of May 14, 1861, and the court, after full and extended consideration, held that the terms "tidelands," used in the act, applied only to lands covered and uncovered by the tides, and did not include lands permanently submerged by the waters of the Bay of San Francisco; that the alcalde grants confirmed by the act were grants only of tidelands as thus defined, and did not embrace the grants under which the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 84 U. S. 651</a></p><p> defendants claimed, and that the premises, so far as they lay below the line of low-water mark, belonged to the state.</p>\n<p>It is not for us to express any opinion as to what would be our construction of the act had the supreme court of the state never spoken on the subject.  In the construction of the statutes of a state, and especially those affecting titles to real property, where no federal question arises, this Court follows the adjudications of the highest court of the state.  Its interpretation is accepted as the true interpretation whatever may be our opinion of its original soundness.  It becomes a part of the statute, as much so as if incorporated into the body of it, and in following the statute as thus interpreted, we only apply to a local question the law of the place.  As has been often remarked, infinite mischiefs would result if, in construing state statutes affecting titles to real property, where no federal question is involved, a different rule were adopted by the federal tribunals from that of the state courts.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Statutes of California of 1861, p. 363.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>30 Cal. 379.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
