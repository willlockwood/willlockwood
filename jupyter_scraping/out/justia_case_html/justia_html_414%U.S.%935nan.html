The United States, on behalf of the Indians, argued that the words of the exceptions clause, though obviously general, nonetheless encompassed the right of occupancy of the Indians. The Court, finding the occupancy of the individual Indians closely akin to the \'original nomadic tribal occupancy\' relied on by petitioners in this case, agreed with the United States because \'[u]nqustionably it has been the policy of the Federal Government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy.\' Id., at 227. The Court held that the \'fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive. The right, under the circumstances here disclosed, flows from a settled governmental policy.\' Id., at 229. </p><p> As the Court stated in 1912, </p><ul>\'[I]n the Government\'s dealings with the Indians . . . [t]he construction, instead of being strict, is liberal; doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the United States, are to be resolved in favor of a weak and defenseless people, who are wards of the nation, and dependent wholly upon its protection and good faith. This rule of construction has been recognized, without exception, for more than a hundred years . . ..\' Choate v. Trapp, <a href="/cases/federal/us/224/665/case.html#675">224 U.S. 665, 675</a>.</ul> <p> I see no reason why, in our time, that rule of construction should be nullified in the absence of any affirmative showing that Congress chose not to recognize aboriginal Indian title as a defense to 18 U.S.C. 1852. Considering the solicitude of the Federal Government for Indian title in the past, the Court of Appeals arguably was in error in rejecting the claims of the petitioners </p><p><a class="page-number" name="938">Page 414 U.S. 935 , 938</a></p><p> when it could find no \'relevant authority.\' I would take the case and put it down for oral argument.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
