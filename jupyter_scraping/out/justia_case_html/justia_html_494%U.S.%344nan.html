Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html">475 U. S. 625</a></span> (1986), the Court established a prophylactic rule that once a criminal defendant invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a subsequent waiver of that right -- even if voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under traditional standards -- is presumed invalid if secured pursuant to police-initiated conversation.  We held that statements obtained in violation of that rule may not be admitted as substantive evidence in the prosecution\'s case-in-chief.  The question presented in this case is whether the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 494 U.

We hold that it may do so.</p>\n<p>Respondent Tyris Lemont Harvey was convicted of two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct in connection with the rape of Audrey Sharp on June 11, 1986.  Harvey was taken into custody on July 2, 1986, and on that date, he made a statement to an investigating officer.  He was arraigned later on July 2, and counsel was appointed for him.  More than two months later, Harvey told another police officer that he wanted to make a second statement, but did not know whether he should talk to his lawyer.  Although the entire context of the discussion is not clear from the record, the officer told respondent that he did not need to speak with his attorney, because "his lawyer was going to get a copy of the statement anyway."  App. 3233 (stipulation of prosecution).  Respondent then signed a constitutional rights waiver form, on which he initialed the portions advising him of his right to remain silent, his right to have a lawyer present before and during questioning, and his right to have a lawyer appointed for him prior to any questioning.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Asked whether he understood his constitutional rights, respondent answered affirmatively.  He then gave a statement detailing his version of the events of June 11.</p>\n<p>At a bench trial, Sharp testified that Harvey visited her home at 2:30 a.m. on the date in question and asked to use the telephone.  After placing a call, Harvey confronted Sharp with a barbecue fork, and a struggle ensued.  According to Sharp, respondent struck her in the face, threatened her with the fork and a pair of garden shears, and eventually threw her to the floor of her kitchen.  When she ran to the living room to escape, Harvey pursued her with the weapons, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 494 U. S. 347</a></p><p> demanded that she take off her clothes, and forced her to engage in sexual acts.</p>\n<p>Harvey testified in his own defense and presented a conflicting account of the night\'s events.  He claimed that he had gone to Sharp\'s home at 9 p.m. and invited her to smoke some crack cocaine, which he offered to supply in return for sexual favors.  She agreed, but after smoking the cocaine, she refused to perform the favors.  When respondent would not leave her house, Sharp allegedly grabbed the barbecue fork and threatened him, triggering a brief fight during which he grabbed the fork and threw it to the ground.  The two then moved to the living room, where, according to Harvey, Sharp voluntarily removed her clothes.  He testified, however, that the two never engaged in sexual intercourse, and that he left shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, the prosecutor used Harvey\'s second statement to police to impeach his testimony.  Before doing so, the prosecutor stipulated that the statement "was not subject to proper <em>Miranda,</em>" App. 32, and therefore could not have been used in the case-in-chief.  But because the statement was voluntary, the prosecutor argued that it could be used for impeachment under our decision in <em>Harris v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html">401 U. S. 222</a></span> (1971).  Defense counsel did not object, App. 34; App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, and the trial court permitted the questioning.  The prosecutor then impeached certain of Harvey\'s statements, including his claim that he had thrown the barbecue fork to the floor, by showing that he had omitted that information from his statement to the police.  App. 36-45. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The trial judge believed the victim\'s testimony, and found respondent guilty as charged. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 494 U. S. 348</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  The court noted that, if the second statement had been taken only in violation of the rules announced in <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), it could have been used to impeach Harvey\'s testimony.  It held, however, that the statement was inadmissible even for impeachment purposes, because it was taken "in violation of defendant\'s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  <em>See e.g., Michigan v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html">475 U. S. 625</a></span> (1986)."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a-7a.  Because the trial "involved a credibility contest between defendant and the victim," the court concluded that the impeachment was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.</em> at 7a.  The Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal, three justices dissenting, and we granted certiorari.  489 U.S. 1010 (1989).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p>To understand this case, it is necessary first to review briefly the Court\'s jurisprudence surrounding the Sixth Amendment.  The text of the Amendment provides in pertinent part that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."  The essence of this right, we recognized in <em>Powell v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html">287 U. S. 45</a></span> (1932), is the opportunity for a defendant to consult with an attorney, and to have him investigate the case and prepare a defense for trial.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#58">287 U. S. 58</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#71">287 U. S. 71</a></span>.  More recently, in a line of cases beginning with <em>Massiah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html">377 U. S. 201</a></span> (1964), and extending through <em>Maine v. Moulton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html">474 U. S. 159</a></span> (1985), the Court has held that, once formal criminal proceedings begin, the Sixth Amendment renders inadmissible in the prosecution\'s case-in-chief statements "deliberately elicited" from a defendant without an express waiver of the right to counsel.  <em>See also United States v. Henry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/264/case.html">447 U. S. 264</a></span> (1980); <em>Brewer v. Williams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/case.html">430 U. S. 387</a></span> (1977).  For the fruits of postindictment interrogations to be admissible in a prosecution\'s case-in-chief, the State must prove a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent relinquishment of the Sixth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 494 U. S. 349</a></p><p> right to counsel.  <em>Patterson v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html">487 U. S. 285</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html#292">487 U. S. 292</a></span>, and n. 4 (1988); <em>Brewer, supra,</em> 430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/case.html#404">430 U. S. 404</a></span>.  We have recently held that when a suspect waives his right to counsel after receiving warnings equivalent to those prescribed by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra,</em> that will generally suffice to establish a knowing and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel for purposes of postindictment questioning.  <em>Patterson v. Illinois, supra.</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Michigan v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html">475 U. S. 625</a></span> (1986), the Court created a bright-line rule for deciding whether an accused who has "asserted" his Sixth Amendment right to counsel has subsequently waived that right.  Transposing the reasoning of <em>Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981), which had announced an identical "prophylactic rule" in the Fifth Amendment context, <em>see Solem v. Stumes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html">465 U. S. 638</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#644">465 U. S. 644</a></span> (1984), we decided that, after a defendant requests assistance of counsel, any waiver of Sixth Amendment rights given in a discussion initiated by police is presumed invalid, and evidence obtained pursuant to such a waiver is inadmissible in the prosecution\'s case-in-chief.  <em>Jackson, supra,</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html#636">475 U. S. 636</a></span>.  Thus, to help guarantee that waivers are truly voluntary, <em>Jackson</em> established a presumption which renders invalid some waivers that would be considered voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under the traditional case-by-case inquiry called for by <em>Brewer v. Williams.</em></p>\n<p>There is no dispute in this case that respondent had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the time he gave the statement at issue.  The State further concedes that the police transgressed the <em>Jackson</em> rule, because the colloquy between respondent and the investigating officer "cannot be viewed as defendant-initiated interrogation."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  The question, then, is whether a statement to police taken in violation of <em>Jackson</em> can be admitted to impeach a defendant\'s inconsistent trial testimony.</p>\n<p><em>Michigan v. Jackson</em> is based on the Sixth Amendment, but its roots lie in this Court\'s decisions in <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 494 U. S. 350</a></p><p> <em>supra,</em> and succeeding cases.  <em>Miranda,</em> of course, required police interrogators to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and set forth a now-familiar set of suggested instructions for that purpose.  Although recognizing that the <em>Miranda</em> rules would result in the exclusion of some voluntary and reliable statements, the Court imposed these "prophylactic standards" on the States, <em>see Michigan v. Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html">417 U. S. 433</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#446">417 U. S. 446</a></span> (1974), to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  <em>Edwards v. Arizona</em> added a second layer of protection to the <em>Miranda</em> rules, holding that</p>\n<p>"when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#484">451 U. S. 484</a></span>.  <em>Edwards</em> thus established another prophylactic rule designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into waiving his previously asserted <em>Miranda</em> rights.  <em>See Oregon v. Bradshaw,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/1039/case.html">462 U. S. 1039</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/1039/case.html#1044">462 U. S. 1044</a></span> (1983) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p><em>Jackson</em> simply superimposed the Fifth Amendment analysis of <em>Edwards</em> onto the Sixth Amendment.  Reasoning that "the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a postarraignment interrogation requires at least as much protection as the Fifth Amendment right to counsel at any custodial interrogation," <em>Jackson, supra,</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html#632">475 U. S. 632</a></span>, the Court in <em>Jackson</em> concluded that the <em>Edwards</em> protections should apply when a suspect charged with a crime requests counsel outside the context of interrogation.  This rule, like <em>Edwards,</em> is based on the supposition that suspects who assert their right to counsel are unlikely to waive that right voluntarily in subsequent interrogations.</p>\n<p>We have already decided that although statements taken in violation of only the prophylactic <em>Miranda</em> rules may not be used in the prosecution\'s case-in-chief, they are admissible to impeach conflicting testimony by the defendant.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html">Harris v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 494 U.

Hass,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/714/case.html">420 U. S. 714</a></span> (1975).  The prosecution must not be allowed to build its case against a criminal defendant with evidence acquired in contravention of constitutional guarantees and their corresponding judicially-created protections.  But use of statements so obtained for impeachment purposes is a different matter.  If a defendant exercises his right to testify on his own behalf, he assumes a reciprocal "obligation to speak truthfully and accurately," <em>Harris, supra,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html#225">401 U. S. 225</a></span>, and we have consistently rejected arguments that would allow a defendant to</p>\n<p>"\'turn the illegal method by which evidence in the Government\'s possession was obtained to his own advantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction of his untruths.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html#224">401 U.

We have mandated the exclusion of reliable and probative evidence for <em>all</em> purposes only when it is derived from involuntary statements.  <em>New Jersey v. Portash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/450/case.html">440 U.

But nothing in the Sixth Amendment prevents a suspect charged with a crime and represented by counsel from voluntarily choosing, on his own, to speak with police in the absence of an attorney.  We have already held that a defendant whose Sixth Amendment right to counsel has attached by virtue of an indictment may execute a knowing and intelligent waiver of that right in the course of a police-initiated interrogation.  <em>Patterson v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html">487 U. S. 285</a></span> (1988).  To be sure, once a defendant obtains or even requests counsel as respondent had here, analysis of the waiver issue changes.  But that change is due to the protective rule we created in <em>Jackson</em> based on the apparent inconsistency between a request for counsel and a later voluntary decision to proceed without assistance.  <em>See</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html#290">487 U.

A defendant\'s right to rely on counsel as a "medium" between the defendant and the State attaches upon the initiation of formal charges, <em>Moulton,</em> 474 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html#176">474 U.

They contend that respondent was affirmatively misled as to his need for counsel, and his purported waiver is therefore invalid.  But on the record before us, it is not possible to determine whether Harvey\'s waiver was knowing and voluntary.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 494 U.

There was no testimony on this point before the trial court.  The only statement in the trial record concerning the issue of waiver is the prosecutor\'s concession that the second statement was taken in violation of respondent\'s <em>Miranda</em> rights.  But that concession is consistent with the Michigan Court of Appeals\' finding that the police violated <em>Jackson,</em> which is, after all, only a Sixth Amendment analogue to the <em>Miranda</em> and <em>Edwards</em> decisions.  The Michigan court made no independent inquiry into whether there had been an otherwise valid waiver of the right to counsel, and respondent\'s counsel himself conceded that, putting aside the prosecutor\'s concession, the record is insufficient to determine whether there was a voluntary waiver of Sixth Amendment rights.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-32.  In short, the issue was never litigated in this case.</p>\n<p>Because respondent\'s counsel did not object at trial to the use of his second statement for impeachment purposes, the State had no occasion to offer evidence to establish that Harvey gave a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel under traditional standards.  On remand, the Michigan courts are free to conduct a hearing on that question.  It is the State\'s burden to show that a waiver is knowing and voluntary, <em>Brewer v. Williams, supra,</em> 430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/case.html#404">430 U.

Those facts are not before us, however, and we need not consider the admissibility for impeachment purposes of a voluntary statement obtained in the absence of a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 494 U.

The answer to that question should be plain:</p>\n<p>"The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused, at least after the initiation of formal charges, the right to rely on counsel as a \'medium\' between him and the State."</p>\n<p><em>Maine v.

This right to rely on counsel applies whether the State is seeking evidence for use in its case in chief, rebuttal evidence, information about trial strategy, or material for use as impeachment.</p>\n<p>The Court, couching its conclusion in the language of "prophylactic rules," seemingly answers this question in the affirmative.  It reasons as follows:  Although <em>Michigan v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/case.html">475 U. S. 625</a></span> (1986), is based on the Sixth Amendment, it protects only Fifth Amendment values; the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the introduction of statements taken after the accused has invoked his right to counsel for use as impeachment; therefore, the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Jackson,</em> does not prohibit the use of evidence taken in violation of its strictures for impeachment at trial.  The Court\'s syllogism is flawed from the beginning.  Only two Terms ago, we made clear that the constitutional rule recognized in <em>Jackson</em> is based on the Sixth Amendment interest in preserving "the integrity of an accused\'s choice to communicate with police only through counsel."  <em>Patterson v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html">487 U.

The Court should acknowledge as much and hold that the Sixth Amendment is violated when the fruits of the State\'s impermissible encounter with the represented defendant are used for impeachment just as it is when the fruits are used in the prosecutor\'s case in chief. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 494 U. S. 356</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>To explain the error of the Court\'s analysis, it is appropriate to start where the Court does with the difference between the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the values each serves.  The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  It prevents a criminal defendant from being made "<em>the deluded instrument of his own conviction.\'"  <em>Culombe v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/568/case.html">367 U.

Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 595 (8th ed. 1824)).  Our decisions in <em>Miranda</em> and its progeny primarily safeguard that right against "the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings."  <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U.

The initiation by the police of contact with an unrepresented defendant, after the invocation of the right to counsel during interrogation or at arraignment, creates an irrebuttable presumption that a defendant\'s waiver of his privilege against compelled self-incrimination is not voluntary.  <em>See Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981); <em>Michigan v.

But when that compulsion has been dispelled by the suspect\'s initiation of interrogation and voluntary waiver of his rights, there is no remaining Fifth Amendment objection to introduction at trial of a statement made outside the presence of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Oregon v.

After the right to counsel has been implemented, the State may not short-circuit the adversarial system by confronting the defendant behind counsel\'s back.  In this case, there should be no equivocation about the conclusion that the State violated the Sixth Amendment when it initiated a private interview with respondent outside the presence of counsel and used the products of the interview as impeachment at trial.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Instead of acknowledging that the facts describe a plain violation of respondent\'s Sixth Amendment right, the Court elides the issue by recharacterizing it as involving nothing more than the violation of a "prophylactic" rule.  The purpose of this recharacterization is to enable the Court to draw an analogy to cases like <em>Walder v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/62/case.html">347 U.

The Court\'s analysis, however, simply ignores the reasons why evidence that is taken from an indicted defendant outside the presence of counsel is excluded from trial.</p>\n<p>The Court has held that evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment is excluded from a criminal trial not as a personal right of the criminal defendant, but rather as a remedy for a wrong that is fully accomplished at the time the evidence is obtained.  <em>See, e.g., Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U.

Thus it is that evidence that is the product of an unreasonable search or seizure may nonetheless be introduced for impeachment purposes.  Since its introduction causes no independent constitutional harm, the Court has reasoned that use of illegally obtained evidence for impeachment is not objectionable as long as the general efficacy of the exclusionary rule in deterring future violations of the Fourth Amendment is not thereby impaired.  <em>See Havens,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/620/case.html#627">446 U.

Unwarned statements or statements improperly taken after the invocation of the right to counsel or the right to remain silent, such as respondent\'s statement here, must be excluded from the State\'s case in chief to ensure compliance with <em>Miranda</em>\'s dictates.  But as long as the statement is not unconstitutionally coerced or involuntary, <em>see New Jersey v. Portash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/450/case.html">440 U.

The exclusion of statements made by a represented and indicted defendant outside the presence of counsel follows not as a remedy for a violation that has preceded trial but as a necessary incident of the constitutional right itself. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 494 U.

It is not implicated, as a general matter, in the absence of some effect of the challenged conduct on the trial process itself.  <em>See United States v.

It is thus the use of the evidence for trial, not the method of its collection prior to trial, that is the gravamen of the Sixth Amendment claim.  Although the defendant may not be entitled to a remedy in the form of reversal of the conviction if the evidence is harmless, that conclusion does not alter the fact that admission of the evidence is itself error.  As we explained in <em>Massiah,</em> even when police investigation of a defendant may be "entirely proper," a defendant is "denied the basic protections of [the Sixth Amendment] guarantee when there [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents . . . deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel."  377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html#206">377 U.

There is no reason why that rule should not apply here. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 494 U. S. 364</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court contents itself with the statement, drawn from <em>Oregon v. Hass, supra,</em> that there is only a "speculative possibility" that the State would be deterred from conducting a private interview with a represented defendant by a rule that excludes its product from use as impeachment at trial.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">494 U. S. 351</span>-352..  Aside from the fact that the Court\'s assurance will provide scant comfort to the defendant, such as respondent, whose statement is admitted at trial, it is perfectly clear that the balance struck in <em>Hass</em> would not prevent the unlawful police and prosecutorial conduct here.  The police misconduct in <em>Walder, Harris, Havens,</em> and <em>Hass</em> all occurred before the defendant had been formally charged, when the unsolved crime was still being investigated and the questioning of a suspect might be expected to produce evidence that is necessary to obtain an indictment.  Knowledge that the improper conduct of an interrogation will destroy its use as substantive evidence provides a powerful incentive to follow the dictates of <em>Miranda</em> and its progeny with great care.</p>\n<p>Once a defendant is formally charged with an offense, however, the State is no longer merely engaged in the task of determining who committed an unsolved crime; rather, it is preparing to convict the defendant of the crime he allegedly committed.  "[T]he government\'s role shifts from investigation to accusation."  <em>Moran v. Burbine,</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#430">475 U. S. 430</a></span>.  The State has obtained sufficient evidence to establish probable cause, see <em>Patterson v. Illinois,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html#306">487 U. S. 306</a></span> (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and the ethical prosecutor has sufficient admissible evidence to convict. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  In practice, the investigation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 494 U. S. 365</a></p><p> is often virtually complete. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Any subsequent investigation is a form of discovery. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The cost of an illegal interrogation is therefore greatly reduced.  The police would have everything to gain and nothing to lose by repeatedly visiting with the defendant and seeking to elicit as many comments as possible about the pending trial.  Knowledge that such conversations could not be used affirmatively would not detract from the State\'s interest in obtaining them for their value as impeachment evidence. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my dissenting opinion in <em>Patterson v. Illinois,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html#301">487 U. S. 301</a></span>-302, I expressed my concern about the Court\'s condonation of unethical forms of trial preparation. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  I unsuccessfully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 494 U. S. 366</a></p><p> argued that private interviews with a defendant conducted by the prosecutor for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against him at trial were so manifestly unfair that the practice should be flatly prohibited at any time after formal proceedings begin and the Sixth Amendment right attaches.  The Court rejected my argument and held that a properly advised defendant whose right to counsel has not been implemented can validly waive his right to counsel after <em>Miranda</em> warnings have been administered.  In explaining that holding, the Court recognized that the waiver issue cannot be resolved without</p>\n<p>"asking what purposes a lawyer can serve at the particular stage of the proceedings in question, and what assistance he could provide to an accused at that stage."</p>\n<p>487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/case.html#298">487 U. S. 298</a></span>.  The Court identified the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 494 U. S. 367</a></p><p> constitutional right as a "spectrum" with minimal protection at one extreme and the maximum at the other.</p>\n<p>"At the other extreme, recognizing the enormous importance and role that an attorney plays at a criminal trial, we have imposed the most rigorous restrictions on the information that must be conveyed to a defendant, and the procedures that must be observed, before permitting him to waive his right to counsel at trial.  <em>See Faretta v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/422/806/case.html">422 U. S. 806</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/422/806/case.html#835">422 U. S. 835</a></span>-836  (1975); <em>cf. Von Moltke v. Gillies,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/332/708/case.html">332 U.

In these extreme cases, and in others that fall between these two poles, we have defined the scope of the right to counsel by a pragmatic assessment of the usefulness of counsel to the accused at the particular proceeding, and the dangers to the accused of proceeding without counsel."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In this case, the Court has nothing to say about the point on this spectrum at which the interview with respondent took place and the standards that would be sufficient to establish a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right.  At the outset, the Court seems to hold that impeachment is always permissible, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] but in the end, after acknowledging that analysis of the waiver issue changes when a defendant obtains or requests counsel, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/344/case.html#352">494 U. S. 352</a></span>, the Court simply asserts that the defendant must make "a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/344/case.html#354">494 U. S. 354</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  The interview at issue in this case occurred after the right to counsel had been implemented, when respondent had been in custody for over two months and was to be tried in only a few days.  Although the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 494 U. S. 368</a></p><p> interview was conducted by a police officer, rather than a lawyer, it was in many respects comparable to a pretrial deposition.  The value of representation by counsel is evident.  If respondent had been properly advised by counsel in preparation for such a deposition, he would have reviewed all of the facts he intended to describe in his trial testimony and been counseled not to omit any significant details, including presumably the three whose omission the State made use of as impeachment here. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Interrogation outside the presence of counsel at this advanced stage of the proceedings can impair counsel\'s representation of his client and interfere with trial strategy.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether or not the Court is prepared to accept a finding that respondent\'s participation in such a pretrial deposition was "voluntary" -- as measured by some undisclosed standard -- it surely denigrates the value of the constitutional interest in the assistance of counsel to condone such a shabby practice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Apparently as a means of identifying rules that it disfavors, the Court repeatedly uses the term "prophylactic rule."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/344/case.html#345">494 U.

An argument that a rule of law may be ignored, avoided or manipulated simply because it is "prophylactic" is nothing more than an argument against the rule of law itself.  The tragedy of today\'s decision is not merely its denigration of the constitutional right at stake; it also undermines the principle that those who are entrusted with the power of government have the same duty to respect and obey the law as the ordinary citizen.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"No person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . ."

The accused confronted the prosecutor and the witnesses against him, and the evidence was marshalled, largely at the trial itself.  In contrast, today\'s law enforcement machinery involves critical confrontations of the accused by the prosecution at pretrial proceedings where the results might well settle the accused\'s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality.  In recognition of these realities of modern criminal prosecution, our cases have construed the Sixth Amendment guarantee to apply to \'critical\' stages of the proceedings."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#224">388 U.

Rather, <em>Massiah</em> explicitly permits government efforts to obtain information from an indicted suspect, so long as that information is not used \'as evidence against <em>him</em> at his trial.\'  The failure to exclude evidence, therefore, cannot be considered <em>collateral</em> to some more fundamental violation.

In a civil context, I would consider this behavior unethical and unfair.  In a criminal context I regard it as such a departure from \'procedural regularity\' as to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

Those who are not held in custody after the attorney-client relationship has been formed are not exposed to daily contact with the police, and therefore have little stake in the rule announced in this case.  Because the indigent defendant has only occasional contact with his lawyer, but is under the constant control of the prosecutor, it is he whose interests are most affected by the Court\'s ruling.  The Court should at least pause before adopting a rule that can have such an obviously disparate impact on indigent defendants.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>"The Court should not condone unethical forms of trial preparation by prosecutors or their investigators.  In civil litigation it is improper for a lawyer to communicate with his or her adversary\'s client without either notice to opposing counsel or the permission of the court.  An attempt to obtain evidence for use at trial by going behind the back of one\'s adversary would be not only a serious breach of professional ethics, but also a manifestly unfair form of trial practice.  In the criminal context, the same ethical rules apply, and, in my opinion, notions of fairness that are at least as demanding should also be enforced."</p>\n<p>"After a jury has been impaneled and a criminal trial is in progress, it would obviously be improper for the prosecutor to conduct a private interview with the defendant for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against him at trial.  By \'private interview,\' I mean, of course, an interview initiated by the prosecutor, or his or her agents, without notice to the defendant\'s lawyer and without the permission of the court."</p>\n<p>(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>As a matter of ethics, the conduct of the officer here was plainly improper.  Under the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct, as under the ABA\'s Code of Professional Responsibility, a prosecutor may not talk to the defendant without first giving notice to his opposing counsel.  <em>See</em> Mich. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 4.2 (1989); ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-104(A)(1) (1980).  That ethical restraint also applies to agents of the prosecutor.  <em>See</em> Mich.Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.3 (1989); <em>see also</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12.  Indeed, the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association has recently stressed that the requirements of DR 7-104(A)(1) are applicable to government prosecutors.

Respondent testified that he and the victim had smoked cocaine in the victim\'s house on the night of the incident, and that another man and woman had been present during part of the time.  App. 5-6.  He testified at trial that he did not know the man\'s name, <em>id.</em> at 36, but, in the statement, he had indicated that he "thought" his name was "Michael."  <em>Id.</em> at 37.  Moreover, he also testified that this other man "had some caine, too, and he was smoking his.  So we were like exchanging."  <em>Id.</em> at 39.
