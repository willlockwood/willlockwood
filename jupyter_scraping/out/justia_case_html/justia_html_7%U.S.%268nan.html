CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This Court has no jurisdiction, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, but in a case where a final judgment or decree has been rendered in the highest court of law or equity of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States and the decision is against their validity, &amp;c., or where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution or of a treaty or statute of or commission </p><p><a class="page-number" name="270">Page 7 U. S. 270</a></p><p> held under the United States and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party under such clause of the said Constitution, treaty, statute, or commission.</p>\n<p>In the present case, such of the defendants as were aliens filed a petition to remove the cause to the federal circuit court under the 12th section of the same act.  The state court granted the prayer of the petition and ordered the cause to be removed; the decision therefore was not against the privilege claimed under the statute, and therefore this Court has no jurisdiction in the case.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of error must be dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
