At the time, Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying at the home with her daughter.  Matthews found Cruse in bed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a gun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before.  Matthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went into the next room, where he found his wife.  He had sexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her until about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her.  Cruse would die from her wound later that day.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMatthews was apprehended that morning at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, where he had already begun to wash the clothes he wore during the crime.  Later in the day, police officers found the murder weapon secreted below the floorboards of a backyard shed on the property.  At the police station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement to a police detective in which he denied responsibility for the murders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders and for burglary.  At trial, he did not contest that he killed the two victims.  Instead, he sought to show that he had acted under \xe2\x80\x9cextreme emotional disturbance,\xe2\x80\x9d which under Kentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would otherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7507.020(1)(a), 507.030(1)(b) (West 2006).  As support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the troubled history of his marriage with Marlene.  Matthews and his wife had been frequently separated from one another, and their periods of separation were marked by extreme hostility.  Marlene would regularly procure criminal warrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders she obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of Marlene\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 spending roughly three weeks in jail.  Witnesses also testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews when they were together and would yell at him from across the street when they were separated; and Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 mother recounted that Marlene would leave the couple\xe2\x80\x99s young child crying in the street late at night outside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order to antagonize him.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMatthews also introduced the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews.  Dr. Chutkow related what Matthews had told him about the murders, including that Matthews had been drinking heav- ily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug.  Dr. Chut- kow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suf- fering from an adjustment disorder, which he described as a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in individuals who are subject to a variety of stresses,\xe2\x80\x9d that would temporarily impair a person\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and cause symptoms such as \xe2\x80\x9canxiety, nervousness, depression, even suicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 Record 558.  Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that Matthews was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders\xe2\x80\x94in particular, that he experienced \xe2\x80\x9cextreme tension, irritability, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 567, whom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated him.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was sentenced to death.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 37 claims of error.  Matthews v. Commonwealth, 709 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 414, 417 (1985).  In response to Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had acted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the court concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconduct before, during and after the offense was more than sufficient to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings of capital murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 421.  A claim that the prosecutor had committed misconduct during his closing argument was rejected on the merits, but without discussion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing an unsuccessful state postconviction proceeding, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  Matthews contended, among other things, that the Kentucky Supreme Court had contravened clearly established federal law in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed with instructions to grant relief.  651 F.\xc2\xa03d 489 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  The Sixth Circuit gave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was entitled to relief under this \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to meet .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and highly deferential standard,\xe2\x80\x9d Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither is valid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme Court had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews committed his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on extreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 97, 108 (1980), which placed the burden of producing evidence on the defendant, but left the bur- den of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturbance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the defendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the issue.  According to the Sixth Circuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed from that understanding in Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 case and placed the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance \xe2\x80\x9centirely on the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d 651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 500.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is supported by certain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 case.  For example, the state court indicated that Matthews had \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[ed] extensive evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of his extreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence he had presented \xe2\x80\x9cfar from overwhelming,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than by stating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt.  Matthews, 709 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 420\xe2\x80\x93421.  The state court also observed that it had recently clarified in Wellman v. Com- monwealth, 694 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 696 (1985), that \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of extreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the crime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirmatively prove.\xe2\x80\x9d  Matthews, supra, at 421.  In the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on this Wellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in resolving Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 appeal violated the Due Process Clause, as construed by this Court in Bouie v. City of Columbia, \n\n378 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347, \n354 (1964)\n, because it involved the retroactive application of an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unexpected and indefensible\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s initial assessment of the evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant if they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.  It is not clear, however, that they did.  The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trial court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions in regard to extreme emotional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported the jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings of intentional murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  709 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 421.  Those jury instructions required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted \xe2\x80\x9cunder the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable justification or excuse under the circumstances as he believed them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 Record 625, 628\xe2\x80\x93629.  The case had been submitted to the jury with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Supreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that finding.  That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 claim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a ground of questionable validity.  See Wetzel v. Lambert, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme emotional disturbance.  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the responsibility of the jury\xe2\x80\x94not the court\xe2\x80\x94to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial,\xe2\x80\x9d Cavazos v. Smith, \n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).  The evidence is sufficient to support a conviction whenever, \xe2\x80\x9cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jackson v. Virginia, \n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307, \n319 (1979)\n.  And a state-court decision rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on federal habeas unless the \xe2\x80\x9cdecision was \xe2\x80\x98objectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Cavazos, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abundantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal habeas proceeding.  The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr. Chutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on cross-examination.  But there was ample evidence pointing in the other direction as well.  As the Kentucky Supreme Court observed, Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 claim of extreme emo- tional disturbance was belied by \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d 709 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 421\xe2\x80\x94including the facts that he borrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day of the murders, that he waited several hours after buying the gun before starting for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s home, and that he delayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law and killing his wife.  The claim was also belied by his behavior after the murders, including his \xe2\x80\x9c[taking] steps to hide the gun and clean his clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d and later \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing] a false statement to the police.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit discounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified that Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 deliberateness and consciousness of wrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of extreme emotional disturbance.  651 F.\xc2\xa03d., at 504, n.\xc2\xa04.  But expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive presumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable to conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the tension between Dr. Chutkow\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and their own common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.  In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow\xe2\x80\x99s testi- mony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its authority.  See Jackson, supra, at 326.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to consider the possibility that the jury could have found the symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter under Kentucky law: that Matthews \xe2\x80\x9cacted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7507.020(1)(a).  Dr. Chutkow himself agreed that many people face tension and anxiety\xe2\x80\x94two symptoms he attributed to Matthews.  6 Record 579\xe2\x80\x93580.  And he agreed that many people suffer from adjustment disorders.  Id., at 592.  But of course very few people commit murders.  In light of these points, which bear on the proper characterization of Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 mental condition and the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme Court made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance was properly committed to the jury for resolution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit held that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument constituted a denial of due process.  This claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky Supreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.  See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8).  The \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d relevant here is our decision in Darden v. Wainwright, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 168 (1986)\n, which explained that a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s improper comments will be held to violate the Constitution only if they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 181 (quoting Donnelly v.

But although the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument which could be understood as raising a charge of collusion,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t the court did not address the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s statement that immediately followed the quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of collusion:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.  Not at all.  He is entitled to the best defense he can get, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the only defense he has, what the doctor has to say, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that the doctor gets on the stand and perjures himself.  He\xe2\x80\x99s telling you the truth.  He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t perjure himself for anything.  He\xe2\x80\x99s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Record 674.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tWith the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s immediate clarification that he was not alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly violated due process is unsupportable.  Nor does the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Matthews had \xe2\x80\x9cenhance[d] his story to Doctor Chutkow,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s grant of habeas relief.  In context, that statement is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews had a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in his meetings with Dr. Chutkow.  Shortly after the quoted statement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhetorical questions:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other people might be doing to his mother?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist?\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court in support of its conclusion that due process prohibits a prosecutor from emphasizing a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motive to exaggerate exculpatory facts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit also suggested that the prosecutor \xe2\x80\x9cdenigrated the [extreme emotional disturbance] defense itself,\xe2\x80\x9d 651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 506, by stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t\xe2\x80\x99s the defense of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen.  He has no excuse for his conduct, but that\xe2\x80\x99s his only way out.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Record 674.  But the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood this comment too as having been directed at Matthews\xe2\x80\x99 motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance\xe2\x80\x94i.e., as emphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense raised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional disturbance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, even if the comment is understood as directing the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention to inappropriate considerations, that would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the Darden prosecutorial misconduct claim \xe2\x80\x9cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harrington, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Indeed, Darden itself held that a closing argument considerably more inflammatory than the one at issue here did not warrant habeas relief.  See 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 180, n. 11 (prosecutor referred to the defendant as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98animal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 180, n. 12 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could see [the defendant] with no face, blown away by a shotgun\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Particularly because the Darden standard is a very general one, leaving courts \xe2\x80\x9cmore leeway .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d Yarborough v.

After quoting the governing standard from our decision in Darden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] in a two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality.  \xe2\x80\x98To satisfy the standard .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 505 (quoting Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)).  It went on to evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four factors derived from its own precedent: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98(1) the likelihood that the remarks .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against [Matthews].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 506 (quoting Broom, supra, at 412).  And it stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s comments in this case were sufficiently similar to\xe2\x80\x9d certain comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in Gall II, 231 F.\xc2\xa03d 265 (CA6 2000), \xe2\x80\x9cthat they rise to the level of impropriety.\xe2\x80\x9d  651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 506.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we explained in correcting an identical error by the Sixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312), circuit precedent does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  It therefore cannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA.  Nor can the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on its own precedents be defended in this case on the ground that they merely reflect what has been \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d by our cases.  The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here.  To make matters worse, the Sixth Circuit decided Gall II under pre-AEDPA law, see 231 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 283, n.\xc2\xa02, so that case did not even purport to reflect clearly established law as set out in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings.  It was plain and repetitive error for the Sixth Circuit to rely on its own precedents in granting Matthews habeas relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.

The court referred to a statement in the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth 607 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 97, 109 (1980), that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless the evidence raising the issue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that otherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an acquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required to come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on its own opinion in Gall\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas proceeding, Gall v. Parker, 231 F.\xc2\xa03d 265 (CA6 2000) (Gall II), the Sixth Circuit suggested that the quoted statement \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] a defendant to bear the heavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d 651 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 504, n.\xc2\xa05, in violation of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Mullaney v. Wilbur, \n.  That is not so.  The statement explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the prosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is assigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as a matter of law.  That seems to us a truism.  See 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7338, pp. 419\xe2\x80\x93420 (5th ed. 1999).  Our opinion in Mullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was shifted to the defendant, see 421 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702, and n. 31; it does not remotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s truism contravened clearly established federal law.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The full text of the section the Sixth Circuit found objectionable is as follows:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s arraigned, he meets with his attorney and either he tells his at-torney, I did it or I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.  One or the other.  But, the attorney knows what the evidence is.  By the way, the defendant knows what the evidence is, because while he\xe2\x80\x99s giving this statement, it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting right in front of him at the Homicide Office.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s the gun.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s the shoes, David.  \xe2\x80\x98Nah, nah, I never saw it before.  I never borrowed a gun.  I never borrowed any money.  I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.  I was at home in bed asleep.\xe2\x80\x99  He\xe2\x80\x99s denying it there.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does his attorney think? His attorney sees all this evidence, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going through his mind, what kind of legal excuse canI have?  What is this man\xe2\x80\x99s defense?  Self protection?  No, there\xe2\x80\x99s no proof of a gun found at that house on 310 North 24th Street.  No proof of that.  Protection of another?  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mother is at home on Lytle Street.  He isn\xe2\x80\x99t protecting her over there on North 24th Street.  Intoxication?  Yeah, well, he was drinking that night.  Maybe that will mean something.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Mr. Busse has to contact a psychiatrist to see his client, and he comes in and sees his client one month after the day of his arrest, one month to the day, and by that time, Mr. David Eugene Matthews sees his defense in the form of Doctor Chutkow, and do you think this guy is aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?  He\xe2\x80\x99s competent.  He can work with his attorney, and he enhances his story to Doctor Chutkow.  Yeah, I was drinking.  I was drinking a lot.  I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I was taking.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the psychiatrist?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other people might be doing to his mother?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he would overstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist?  It\xe2\x80\x99s the defense of last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen.  He has no excuse for his conduct, but that\xe2\x80\x99s his only way out.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Record 673\xe2\x80\x93674.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
