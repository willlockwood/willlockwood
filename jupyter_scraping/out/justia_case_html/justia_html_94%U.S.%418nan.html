CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It seems clear to us that the object in this case is to use the writ of mandamus as a writ of error.  This cannot be done.  We may require the circuit court to decide in a proper case if it refuses to act, but cannot control its decision.  Here the court has acted and given its decision upon a motion made.  We are asked now to require it to reverse that decision.  For that, resort must be had to a writ of error after a final judgment has been rendered.  The writ of mandamus has no such office to perform.</p>\n<p><em>Petition denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
