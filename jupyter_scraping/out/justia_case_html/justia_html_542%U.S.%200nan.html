Argued March 23, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 21, 2004<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">Respondents brought separate Texas state-court suits, alleging that petitioners, their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), had refused to cover certain medical services in violation of an HMO\xe2\x80\x99s duty \xe2\x80\x9cto exercise ordinary care\xe2\x80\x9d under the Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA), and that those refusals \xe2\x80\x9cproximately caused\xe2\x80\x9d respondents\xe2\x80\x99 injuries<em>.</em>  Petitioners removed the cases to federal courts, claiming that the actions fit within the scope of, and were thus completely pre-empted by, \xc2\xa7502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Courts agreed, declined to remand the cases to state court, and dismissed the complaints with prejudice after respondents refused to amend them to bring explicit ERISA claims.  Consolidating these and other cases, the Fifth Circuit reversed.  It found that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims did not fall under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(2), which allows suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty to the plan, because petitioners were being sued for mixed eligibility and treatment decisions that were not fiduciary in nature, see <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a>; and did not fall within the scope of \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits, because THCLA did not duplicate that cause of action, see <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moran,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/index.html">536 U. S. 355</a>.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state causes of action fall within ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), and are therefore completely pre-empted by ERISA \xc2\xa7502 and removable to federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0When a federal statute completely pre-empts a state-law cause of action, the state claim can be removed.  See <em>Beneficial Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Anderson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/1/index.html">539 U. S. 1</a>, 8.  ERISA is such a statute.  Because its purpose is to provide a uniform regulatory regime, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, such an ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)\xe2\x80\x99s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively a federal concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alessi</em> v. <em>Raybestos&amp;nbhyph;Manhattan, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/504/index.html">451 U. S. 504</a>, 523.  Any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s civil enforcement remedy conflicts with clear congressional intent to make that remedy exclusive, and is therefore pre-empted.  ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive force is still stronger.  Since ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive force mirrors that of \xc2\xa7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/58/index.html">481 U. S. 58</a>, 65\xe2\x80\x9366, and since \xc2\xa7301 converts state causes of actions into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety of removal, so too does ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0If an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), and where no other independent legal duty is implicated by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions, then the individual\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action is completely pre-empted by ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Respondents brought suit only to rectify wrongful benefits denials, and their only relationship with petitioners is petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 partial administration of their ERISA-regulated benefit plans; respondents therefore could have brought \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) claims to recover the allegedly wrongfully denied benefits.  Both respondents allege violations of the THCLA\xe2\x80\x99s duty of ordinary care, which they claim is entirely independent of any ERISA duty or the employee benefits plans at issue.  However, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims do not arise independently of ERISA or the plan terms.  If a managed care entity correctly concluded that, under the relevant plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, a particular treatment was not covered, the plan\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cover the requested treatment would be the proximate cause of any injury arising from the denial.  More significantly, the THCLA provides that a managed care entity is not subject to THCLA liability if it denies coverage for a treatment not covered by the plan it administers.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for reaching its contrary conclusion are all erroneous.  First, it found significant that respondents asserted tort, rather than contract, claims and that they were not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied.  However, distinguishing between pre-empted and non-pre-empted claims based on the particular label affixed to them would allow parties to evade ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope simply by relabeling contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contracts.  And the fact that a state cause of action attempts to authorize remedies beyond those that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) authorizes does not put it outside the scope of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s civil enforcement mechanism.  See, <em>e.g., Pilot Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Dedeaux,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/index.html">481 U. S. 41</a>, 43.  Second, the court believed the plans\xe2\x80\x99 wording immaterial because the claims invoked an external ordinary care duty, but the wording is material to the state causes of action and the THCLA creates a duty that is not external to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 rights under their respective plans.  Finally, nowhere in <em>Rush Prudential</em> did this Court suggest that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive force is limited to state causes of action that precisely duplicate an ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) cause.  Nor would it be consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent to do so.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Also unavailing is respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the THCLA is a law regulating insurance that is saved from pre-emption by ERISA \xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A) is informed by the overpowering federal policy embodied in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)<em>, </em>which is intended to create an exclusive federal remedy,<em> Pilot Life, </em>481 U. S.<em>,</em> at 52.  Allowing respondents to proceed with their state-law suits would \xe2\x80\x9cpose an obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d to that objective.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0<em>Pegram</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding that an HMO is not intended to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions acting through its physicians is not implicated here because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 coverage decisions are pure eligibility decisions.  A benefit determination under ERISA is part and parcel of the ordinary fiduciary responsibilities connected to the administration of a plan.  That it is infused with medical judgments does not alter this result.  <em>Pegram</em> itself recognized this principle, see 530 U. S., at 231\xe2\x80\x93232.  And ERISA and its implementing regulations confirm this interpretation.  Here, petitioners are neither respondents\xe2\x80\x99 treating physicians nor those physicians\xe2\x80\x99 employees.

We hold that the causes of action are completely pre-empted and hence removable from state to federal court.  The Court of Appeals, having reached a contrary conclusion, is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Juan Davila is a participant, and respondent Ruby Calad is a beneficiary, in ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans.  Their respective plan sponsors had entered into agreements with petitioners, Aetna Health Inc. and CIGNA Healthcare of Texas, Inc., to administer the plans.  Under Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plan, for instance, Aetna reviews requests for coverage and pays providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes, which perform covered services for members; under Calad\xe2\x80\x99s plan sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s agreement, CIGNA is responsible for plan benefits and coverage decisions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents both suffered injuries allegedly arising from Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s and CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s decisions not to provide coverage for certain treatment and services recommended by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 treating physicians.  Davila\xe2\x80\x99s treating physician prescribed Vioxx to remedy Davila\xe2\x80\x99s arthritis pain, but Aetna refused to pay for it.  Davila did not appeal or contest this decision, nor did he purchase Vioxx with his own resources and seek reimbursement.  Instead, Davila began taking Naprosyn, from which he allegedly suffered a severe reaction that required extensive treatment and hospitalization.  Calad underwent surgery, and although her treating physician recommended an extended hospital stay, a CIGNA discharge nurse determined that Calad did not meet the plan\xe2\x80\x99s criteria for a continued hospital stay.  CIGNA consequently denied coverage for the extended hospital stay.  Calad experienced postsurgery complications forcing her to return to the hospital.  She alleges that these complications would not have occurred had CIGNA approved coverage for a longer hospital stay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents brought separate suits in Texas state court against petitioners.  Invoking THCLA \xc2\xa788.002(a), respondents argued that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to cover the requested services violated their \xe2\x80\x9cduty to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d and that these refusals \xe2\x80\x9cproximately caused\xe2\x80\x9d their injuries.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Petitioners removed the cases to Federal District Courts, arguing that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action fit within the scope of, and were therefore completely pre-empted by, ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a).  The respective District Courts agreed, and declined to remand the cases to state court.  Because respondents refused to amend their complaints to bring explicit ERISA claims, the District Courts dismissed the complaints with prejudice.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both Davila and Calad appealed the refusals to remand to state court.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit consolidated their cases with several others raising similar issues.  The Court of Appeals recognized that state causes of action that \xe2\x80\x9cduplicat[e] or fal[l] within the scope of an ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) remedy\xe2\x80\x9d are completely pre-empted and hence removable to federal court.  <em>Roark </em>v. <em>Humana, Inc., </em>307 F.\xc2\xa03d 298, 305 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  After examining the causes of action available under \xc2\xa7502(a), the Court of Appeals determined that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims could possibly fall under only two: \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits, and \xc2\xa7502(a)(2), which allows suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty to the plan.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Analyzing \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) first, the Court of Appeals concluded that, under <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a> (2000), the decisions for which petitioners were being sued were \xe2\x80\x9cmixed eligibility and treatment decisions\xe2\x80\x9d and hence were not fiduciary in nature.  307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court of Appeals next determined that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims did not fall within \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  It found significant that respondents \xe2\x80\x9cassert tort claims,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a cause of action for breach of contract,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 309, and also that respondents \xe2\x80\x9care not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied them,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather request \xe2\x80\x9ctort damages\xe2\x80\x9d arising from \xe2\x80\x9can external, statutorily imposed duty of \xe2\x80\x98ordinary care.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  From <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moran,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/index.html">536 U. S. 355</a> (2002), the Court of Appeals derived the principle that complete pre-emption is limited to situations in which \xe2\x80\x9cStates \xe2\x80\xa6 duplicate the causes of action listed in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a),\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause the THCLA does not provide an action for collecting benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d it fell outside the scope of \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 310\xe2\x80\x93311.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the removal statute, \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d to federal court.  28 U.

One category of cases of which district courts have original jurisdiction are \xe2\x80\x9cfederal question\xe2\x80\x9d cases: cases \xe2\x80\x9carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71331.

There is an exception, however, to the well-pleaded complaint rule.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a federal statute wholly displaces the state-law cause of action through complete pre-emption,\xe2\x80\x9d the state claim can be removed.  <em>Beneficial Nat.

This is so because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the federal statute completely pre-empts the state-law cause of action, a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action, even if pleaded in terms of state law, is in reality based on federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  ERISA is one of these statutes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted ERISA to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect \xe2\x80\xa6 the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d by setting out substantive regulatory requirements for employee benefit plans and to \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U.

To this end, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, see ERISA \xc2\xa7514, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71144, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation would be \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively a federal concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alessi</em> v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/504/index.html">451 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a), is a distinctive feature of ERISA, and essential to accomplish Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose of creating a comprehensive statute for the regulation of employee benefit plans.  As the Court said in <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Dedeaux,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/index.html"></a><a href="/us/481/41/index.html">481 U.

The policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.  \xe2\x80\x98The six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in \xc2\xa7502(a) of the statute as finally enacted \xe2\x80\xa6 provide strong evidence that Congress did <em>not</em> intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 54 (quoting <em>Russell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 146).</p>\n<p align="left">\nTherefore, any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted.

Co.</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/58/index.html"></a><a href="/us/481/58/index.html">481 U. S. 58</a>, 65\xe2\x80\x9366 (1987), the Court determined that the similarity of the language used in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), and ERISA, combined with the \xe2\x80\x9cclear intention\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress \xe2\x80\x9cto make \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) suits brought by participants or beneficiaries federal questions for the purposes of federal court jurisdiction in like manner\nas \xc2\xa7301 of the LMRA,\xe2\x80\x9d established that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive force mirrored the pre-emptive force of LMRA \xc2\xa7301.  Since LMRA \xc2\xa7301 converts state causes of action into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety of removal, see <em>Avco Corp.</em> v. <em>Machinists</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/557/index.html">390 U. S. 557</a> (1968), so too does ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Thus, the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism is one of those provisions with such \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary pre-emptive power\xe2\x80\x9d that it \xe2\x80\x9cconverts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, 481 U.

In other words, if an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions, then the individual\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action is completely pre-empted by ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action fall \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), we must examine respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaints, the statute on which their claims are based (the THCLA), and the various plan documents.  Davila alleges that Aetna provides health coverage under his employer\xe2\x80\x99s health benefits plan.  App. H to Pet. for Cert. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931845, p.\xc2\xa067a, \xc2\xb6  ;11.  Davila also alleges that after his primary care physician prescribed Vioxx, Aetna refused to pay for it.  <em>Id</em>., at 67a, \xc2\xb6  ;12.  The only action complained of was Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to approve payment for Davila\xe2\x80\x99s Vioxx prescription.  Further, the only relationship Aetna had with Davila was its partial administration of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s employer\xe2\x80\x99s benefit plan.  See App. 25, 31, 39\xe2\x80\x9340, 45\xe2\x80\x9348, 108.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, Calad alleges that she receives, as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary under an ERISA-regulated benefit plan, health coverage from CIGNA.  <em>Id., </em>at 184, \xc2\xb6  ;17.  She alleges that she was informed by CIGNA, upon admittance into a hospital for major surgery, that she would be authorized to stay for only one day.  <em>Id.,</em> at 184, \xc2\xb6  ;18.  She also alleges that CIGNA, acting through a discharge nurse, refused to authorize more than a single day despite the advice and recommendation of her treating physician.  <em>Id</em>., at 185, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;20, 21.  Calad contests only CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to refuse coverage for her hospital stay.  <em>Id.</em>, at 185, \xc2\xb6  ;20.  And, as in Davila\xe2\x80\x99s case, the only connection between Calad and CIGNA is CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s administration of portions of Calad\xe2\x80\x99s ERISA-regulated benefit plan.  <em>Id., </em>at 219\xe2\x80\x93221.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear, then, that respondents complain only about denials of coverage promised under the terms of ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans.  Upon the denial of benefits, respondents could have paid for the treatment themselves and then sought reimbursement through a \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) action, or sought a preliminary injunction, see <em>Pryzbowski</em> v. <em>U. S. Healthcare, Inc.</em>, 245 F.\xc2\xa03d 266, 274 (CA3 2001) (giving examples where federal courts have issued such preliminary injunctions).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend, however, that the complained-of actions violate legal duties that arise independently of ERISA or the terms of the employee benefit plans at issue in these cases.  Both respondents brought suit specifically under the THCLA, alleging that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled, influenced, participated in and made decisions which affected the quality of the diagnosis, care, and treatment provided\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner that violated \xe2\x80\x9cthe duty of ordinary care set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa788.001 and 88.002.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. H to Pet. for Cert. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931845, at 69a, \xc2\xb6  ;18; see also App. 187, \xc2\xb6  ;28.  Respondents contend that this duty of ordinary care is an independent legal duty.  They analogize to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions interpreting LMRA \xc2\xa7301, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71081, with particular focus on <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/386/index.html">482 U. S. 386</a> (1987) (suit for breach of individual employment contract, even if defendant\xe2\x80\x99s action also constituted a breach of an entirely separate collective bargaining agreement, not pre-empted by LMRA \xc2\xa7301).  Because this duty of ordinary care arises independently of any duty imposed by ERISA or the plan terms, the argument goes, any civil action to enforce this duty is not within the scope of the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The duties imposed by the THCLA in the context of these cases, however, do not arise independently of ERISA or the plan terms.  The THCLA does impose a duty on managed care entities to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d and makes them liable for damages proximately caused by failures to abide by that duty.  \xc2\xa788.002(a).  However, if a managed care entity correctly concluded that, under the terms of the relevant plan, a particular treatment was not covered, the managed care entity\xe2\x80\x99s denial of coverage would not be a proximate cause of any injuries arising from the denial.  Rather, the failure of the plan itself to cover the requested treatment would be the proximate cause.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  More significantly, the THCLA clearly states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he standards in Subsections (a) and (b) create no obligation on the part of the health insurance carrier, health maintenance organization, or other managed care entity to provide to an insured or enrollee treatment which is not covered by the health care plan of the entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa788.002(d).  Hence, a managed care entity could not be subject to liability under the THCLA if it denied coverage for any treatment not covered by the health care plan that it was administering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, interpretation of the terms of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 benefit plans forms an essential part of their THCLA claim, and THCLA liability would exist here only because of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 administration of ERISA-regulated benefit plans.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 potential liability under the THCLA in these cases, then, derives entirely from the particular rights and obligations established by the benefit plans.  So, unlike the state-law claims in <em>Caterpillar</em>, <em>supra</em>, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 THCLA causes of action are not entirely independent of the federally regulated contract itself.  Cf. <em>Allis&amp;nbhyph;Chalmers Corp.</em> v. <em>Lueck</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/202/index.html">471 U. S. 202</a>, 217 (1985) (state-law tort of bad faith handling of insurance claim pre-empted by LMRA \xc2\xa7301, since the \xe2\x80\x9cduties imposed and rights established through the state tort \xe2\x80\xa6 derive[d] from the rights and obligations established by the contract\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Steelworkers</em> v. <em>Rawson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/362/index.html">495 U. S. 362</a>, 371 (1990) (state-law tort action brought due to alleged negligence in the inspection of a mine was pre-empted, as the duty to inspect the mine arose solely out of the collective-bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, respondents bring suit only to rectify a wrongful denial of benefits promised under ERISA-regulated plans, and do not attempt to remedy any violation of a legal duty independent of ERISA.  We hold that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state causes of action fall \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, 481 U. S., at 66, and are therefore completely pre-empted by ERISA \xc2\xa7502 and removable to federal district court.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion for several reasons, all of them erroneous.  First, the Court of Appeals found significant that respondents \xe2\x80\x9cassert a tort claim for tort damages\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ca contract claim for contract damages,\xe2\x80\x9d and that respondents \xe2\x80\x9care not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied them.\xe2\x80\x9d  307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 309<em>.</em>  But, distinguishing between pre-empted and non-pre-empted claims based on the particular label affixed to them would \xe2\x80\x9celevate form over substance and allow parties to evade\xe2\x80\x9d the pre-emptive scope of ERISA simply \xe2\x80\x9cby relabeling their contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allis-Chalmers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 211.  Nor can the mere fact that the state cause of action attempts to authorize remedies beyond those authorized by ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) put the cause of action outside the scope of the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism.  In <em>Pilot Life</em>, <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, and <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em>, the plaintiffs all brought state claims that were labeled either tort or tort-like.  See <em>Pilot Life</em>, 481 U. S., at 43 (suit for, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cTortious Breach of Contract\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (suit requesting damages for \xe2\x80\x9cmental anguish caused by breach of [the] contract\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em>, 498 U. S., at 136 (suit brought under various tort and contract theories).  And, the plaintiffs in these three cases all sought remedies beyond those authorized under ERISA.  See <em>Pilot Life</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 43 (compensatory and punitive damages); <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 61 (mental anguish); <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 136 (punitive damages, mental anguish).  And, in all these cases, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were pre-empted.  The limited remedies available under ERISA are an inherent part of the \xe2\x80\x9ccareful balancing\xe2\x80\x9d between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.  <em>Pilot Life</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 55.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court of Appeals believed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe wording of [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] plans is immaterial\xe2\x80\x9d to their claims, as \xe2\x80\x9cthey invoke an external, statutorily imposed duty of \xe2\x80\x98ordinary care.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 309.  But as we have already discussed, the wording of the plans is certainly material to their state causes of action, and the duty of \xe2\x80\x9cordinary care\xe2\x80\x9d that the THCLA creates is not external to their rights under their respective plans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the Court of Appeals rested its decision on one line from <em>Rush Prudential</em>.  There, we described our holding in <em>Ingersoll-Rand </em>as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile state law duplicated the elements of a claim available under ERISA, it converted the remedy from an equitable one under \xc2\xa71132(a)(3) (available exclusively in federal district courts) into a legal one for money damages (available in a state tribunal).\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 379.  The point of this sentence was to describe why the state cause of action in <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em> was pre-empted by ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a): It was pre-empted because it attempted to convert an equitable remedy into a legal remedy.  Nowhere in <em>Rush Prudential</em> did we suggest that the pre-emptive force of ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) is limited to the situation in which a state cause of action precisely duplicates a cause of action under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would it be consistent with our precedent to conclude that only strictly duplicative state causes of action are pre-empted.  Frequently, in order to receive exemplary damages on a state claim, a plaintiff must prove facts beyond the bare minimum necessary to establish entitlement to an award.  Cf. <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U. S., at 217 (bad-faith refusal to honor a claim needed to be proved in order to recover exemplary damages).  In order to recover for mental anguish, for instance, the plaintiffs in <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em> and <em>Metropolitan Life</em> would presumably have had to prove the existence of mental anguish; there is no such element in an ordinary suit brought under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  See <em>Ingersoll-Rand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 136; <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 61.  This did not save these state causes of action from pre-emption.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to make the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism exclusive would be undermined if state causes of action that supplement the ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) remedies were permitted, even if the elements of the state cause of action did not precisely duplicate the elements of an ERISA claim.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also argue\xe2\x80\x94for the first time in their brief to this Court\xe2\x80\x94that the THCLA is a law that regulates insurance, and hence that ERISA \xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A) saves their causes of action from pre-emption (and thereby from complete pre-emption).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This argument is unavailing.  The existence of a comprehensive remedial scheme can demonstrate an \xe2\x80\x9coverpowering federal policy\xe2\x80\x9d that determines the interpretation of a statutory provision designed to save state law from being pre-empted.  <em>Rush Prudential</em>, 536 U. S., at 375.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s civil enforcement provision is one such example.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this Court stated in <em>Pilot Life</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cour understanding of [\xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A)] must be informed by the legislative intent concerning the civil enforcement provisions provided by ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  481 U. S., at 52.  The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 54.  The Court then held, based on</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe common-sense understanding of the saving clause, the McCarran-Ferguson Act factors defining the business of insurance, and, <em>most importantly</em>, the clear expression of congressional intent that ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s civil enforcement scheme be exclusive, . . . that [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] state law suit asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits under an ERISA-regulated plan is not saved by \xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 57 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pilot Life</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning applies here with full force.  Allowing respondents to proceed with their state-law suits would \xe2\x80\x9cpose an obstacle to the purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 52.  As this Court has recognized in both <em>Rush Prudential</em> and <em>Pilot Life</em>, ERISA \xc2\xa7514(b)(2)(A) must be interpreted in light of the congressional intent to create an exclusive federal remedy in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a).  Under ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption, then, even a state law that can arguably be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cregulating insurance\xe2\x80\x9d will be pre-empted if it provides a separate vehicle to assert a claim for benefits outside of, or in addition to, ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, their <em>amici</em>, and some Courts of Appeals have relied heavily upon <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a> (2000), in arguing that ERISA does not pre-empt or completely pre-empt state suits such as respondents\xe2\x80\x99.  They contend that <em>Pegram</em> makes it clear that causes of action such as respondents\xe2\x80\x99 do not \xe2\x80\x9crelate to [an] employee benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA \xc2\xa7514(a), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71144(a), and hence are not pre-empted.  See Brief for Respondents 35\xe2\x80\x9338; <em>Cicio</em> v. <em>Does</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d 83, 100\xe2\x80\x93104 (CA2 2003); see also <em>Land</em> v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 1286, 1292\xe2\x80\x931294 (CA11 2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pegram</em> cannot be read so broadly.  In <em>Pegram</em>, the plaintiff sued her physician-owned-and-operated HMO (which provided medical coverage through plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s employer pursuant to an ERISA-regulated benefit plan) and her treating physician, both for medical malpractice and for a breach of an ERISA fiduciary duty.  See 530 U. S., at 215\xe2\x80\x93216.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s treating physician was also the person charged with administering plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s benefits; it was she who decided whether certain treatments were covered.  See <em>id.</em>, at 228.  We reasoned that the physician\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celigibility decision and the treatment decision were inextricably mixed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 229.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not intend [the defendant HMO] or any other HMO to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions acting through its physicians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 231.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A benefit determination under ERISA, though, is generally a fiduciary act.  See <em>Bruch,</em> 489 U. S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93113.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt common law, fiduciary duties characteristically attach to decisions about managing assets and distributing property to beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pegram</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 231; cf. 2A A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7182, 183 (4th ed. 1987); G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts &amp; Trustees \xc2\xa7541 (rev. 2d ed. 1993).  Hence, a benefit determination is part and parcel of the ordinary fiduciary responsibilities connected to the administration of a plan.  See <em>Varity Corp</em>. v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 512 (1996) (relevant plan fiduciaries owe a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty with respect to the interpretation of plan documents and the payment of claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  The fact that a benefits determination is infused with medical judgments does not alter this result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pegram</em> itself recognized this principle.  <em>Pegram</em>, in highlighting its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cmixed eligibility decisions\xe2\x80\x9d were not fiduciary in nature, contrasted the operation of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]raditional trustees administer[ing] a medical trust\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cphysicians through whom HMOs act.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 231\xe2\x80\x93232.  A traditional medical trust is administered by \xe2\x80\x9cpaying out money to buy medical care, whereas physicians making mixed eligibility decisions consume the money as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And, significantly, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rivate trustees do not make treatment judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 232.  But a trustee managing a medical trust undoubtedly must make administrative decisions that require the exercise of medical judgment.  Petitioners are not the employers of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 treating physicians and are therefore in a somewhat analogous position to that of a trustee for a traditional medical trust.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ERISA itself and its implementing regulations confirm this interpretation.  ERISA defines a fiduciary as any person \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent \xe2\x80\xa6 he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of [an employee benefit] plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(21)(A)(iii), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002(21)(A)(iii).  When administering employee benefit plans, HMOs must make discretionary decisions regarding eligibility for plan benefits, and, in this regard, must be treated as plan fiduciaries.  See <em>Varity Corp</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 511 (plan administrator \xe2\x80\x9cengages in a fiduciary act when making a discretionary determination about whether a claimant is entitled to benefits under the terms of the plan documents\xe2\x80\x9d).  Also, ERISA \xc2\xa7503, which specifies minimum requirements for a plan\xe2\x80\x99s claim procedure, requires plans to \xe2\x80\x9cafford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71133(2).  This strongly suggests that the ultimate decisionmaker in a plan regarding an award of benefits must be a fiduciary and must be acting as a fiduciary when determining a participant\xe2\x80\x99s or beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The relevant regulations also establish extensive requirements to ensure full and fair review of benefit denials.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931 (2004).  These regulations, on their face, apply equally to health benefit plans and other plans, and do not draw distinctions between medical and nonmedical benefits determinations.  Indeed, the regulations strongly imply that benefits determinations involving medical judgments are, just as much as any other benefits determinations, actions by plan fiduciaries.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(h)(3)(iii).  Classifying any entity with discretionary authority over benefits determinations as anything but a plan fiduciary would thus conflict with ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since administrators making benefits determinations, even determinations based extensively on medical judgments, are ordinarily acting as plan fiduciaries, it was essential to <em>Pegram</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the decisions challenged there were truly \xe2\x80\x9cmixed eligibility and treatment decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 229, <em>i.e.</em>, medical necessity decisions made by the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s treating physician <em>qua</em> treating physician and <em>qua</em> benefits administrator.  Put another way, the reasoning of <em>Pegram</em> \xe2\x80\x9conly make[s] sense where the underlying negligence also plausibly constitutes medical maltreatment by a party who can be deemed to be a treating physician or such a physician\xe2\x80\x99s employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cicio</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 109 (Calabresi, J., dissenting in part).  Here, however, petitioners are neither respondents\xe2\x80\x99 treating physicians nor the employers of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 treating physicians.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 coverage decisions,\nthen, are pure eligibility decisions, and <em>Pegram</em> is not implicated.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action, brought to remedy only the denial of benefits under ERISA-regulated benefit plans, fall within the scope of, and are completely pre-empted by, ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), and thus removable to federal district court.

See Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  Respondents did not identify this possible argument in their brief in opposition to the petitions for certiorari, and we deem it waived.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To take a clear example, if the terms of the health care plan specifically exclude from coverage the cost of an appendectomy, then any injuries caused by the refusal to cover the appendectomy are properly attributed to the terms of the plan itself, not the managed care entity that applied those terms.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Respondents also argue that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a) completely pre-empts a state cause of action only if the cause of action would be pre-empted under ERISA \xc2\xa7514(a); respondents then argue that their causes of action do not fall under the terms of \xc2\xa7514(a).  But a state cause of action that provides an alternative remedy to those provided by the ERISA civil enforcement mechanism conflicts with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear intent to make the ERISA mechanism exclusive.

The plaintiffs in <em>Pilot Life</em> and <em>Metropolitan Life</em> challenged disability determinations made by the insurers of their ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans.

A disability determination often involves medical judgments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.</em> (plaintiff determined not to be disabled only after a medical examination undertaken by one of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s physicians).  Yet, in both <em>Pilot Life</em> and <em>Metropolitan Life</em>, the Court held that the causes of action were pre-empted.

However, after their respective District Courts denied their motions for remand, respondents had the opportunity to amend their complaints to bring expressly a claim under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a).

First, in <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Russell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/index.html">473 U. S. 134</a> (1985), the Court stated, in dicta: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is a stark absence\xe2\x80\x94in [ERISA] itself and in its legislative history\xe2\x80\x94of any reference to an intention to authorize the recovery of extracontractual damages\xe2\x80\x9d for consequential injuries.  <em>Id</em>., at 148.  Then, in <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html">508 U.

Most recently, in <em>Great-West</em>, the Court ruled that, as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7502(a)(3), by its terms, only allows for <em>equitable</em> relief,\xe2\x80\x9d the provision excludes \xe2\x80\x9cthe imposition of personal liability \xe2\x80\xa6 for a contractual obligation to pay money.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U.
