Before <i>Johnson</i>, the residual clause could cause an offender to face a prison sentence of at least 15 years instead of at most 10.  Since <i>Johnson </i>made the clause invalid, it can no longer mandate or authorize any sentence.  By the same logic, <i>Johnson </i>is not procedural, since it had nothing to do with the range of permissible methods a court might use to determine whether a defendant should be sentenced under the Act, see <i>Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353.

The separation-of-powers argument raised by <i>amicus</i> is also misplaced, for regardless of whether a decision involves statutory interpretation or statutory invalidation, a court lacks the power to exact a penalty that has not been authorized by any valid criminal statute.

A person who violates that restriction can be sentenced to prison for up to 10 years.  \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).  For some felons, however, the Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a much more severe penalty.  Under the Act, a person who possesses a firearm after three or more convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life in prison.  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  Because the ordinary maximum sentence for a felon in possession of a firearm is 10 years, while the minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act is 15 years, a person sentenced under the Act will receive a prison term at least five years longer than the law otherwise would allow.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subsection (i) of this definition is known as the elements clause.

See <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 2).  It is the residual clause that <i>Johnson</i> held to be vague and invalid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the residual clause provides little guidance on how to determine whether a given offense \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court sought for a number of years to de-velop the boundaries of the residual clause in a more pre-cise fashion by applying the statute to particular cases.  See <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192 (2007)\n (residual clause covers Florida offense of attempted burglary); <i>Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (2008)\n (residual clause does not cover New Mexico offense of driving under the influence of alcohol); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122 (2009)\n (residual clause does not cover Illinois offense of failure to report to a penal institution); <i>Sykes </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2011)\n (residual clause covers Indiana offense of vehicular flight from a law-enforcement officer).  In <i>Johnson</i>, a majority of this Court concluded that those decisions did not bring sufficient clarity to the scope of the residual clause, noting that the federal courts remained mired in \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d over how the clause should be interpreted.  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Johnson</i> Court held the residual clause unconstitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, a doctrine that is mandated by the Due Process Clauses of the\n \nFifth Amendment (with respect to the Federal Government) and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment (with respect to the States).  The void-for-vagueness doctrine prohibits the government from imposing sanctions \xe2\x80\x9cunder a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 3).  <i>Johnson </i>determined that the residual clause could not be reconciled with that prohibition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The vagueness of the residual clause rests in large part on its operation under the categorical approach.  The categorical approach is the framework the Court has applied in deciding whether an offense qualifies as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Under the categorical approach, \xe2\x80\x9ca court assesses whether a crime qualifies as a violent fel-ony \xe2\x80\x98in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Begay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 141).  For purposes of the residual clause, then, courts were to determine whether a crime involved a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d by considering not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct but an \xe2\x80\x9cidealized ordinary case of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in <i>Johnson </i>thus cast no doubt on the many laws that \xe2\x80\x9crequire gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages <i>on a particular occasion</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The residual clause failed not because it adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard but because applying that standard under the categorical approach required courts to assess the hypothetical risk posed by an abstract generic version of the offense.  In the <i>Johnson </i>Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d made the residual clause more unpredictable and arbitrary in its application than the Consti-tution allows.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  \xe2\x80\x9cInvoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison for 15 years to life,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not comport with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner Gregory Welch is one of the many offenders sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act before <i>Johnson </i>was decided.  Welch pleaded guilty in 2010 to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  The Probation Office prepared a presentence report finding that Welch had three prior violent felony convictions, including a Florida conviction for a February 1996 \xe2\x80\x9cstrong-arm robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  The relevant Florida statute prohibits taking property from the person or custody of another with \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7812.13(1) (1994).  The charging document from the 1996 Florida case tracked that statutory language.  App. 187a.  The 2010 federal presentence report provides more detail. It states that, according to the robbery victim, Welch punched the victim in the mouth and grabbed a gold bracelet from his wrist while another attacker grabbed a gold chain from his neck.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Welch objected to the presentence report, arguing (as relevant here) that this conviction was not a violent felony conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act.  The District Court overruled the objection.  It concluded that the Florida offense of strong-arm robbery qualified as a violent felony both under the elements clause,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and the residual clause, \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <b> </b>The District Court proceeded to sentence Welch to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  That court did not decide whether the conviction at issue could qualify as a violent felony under the elements clause. Instead, it held only that the conviction qualified under the residual clause. <b> </b>This Court denied certiorari, see <i>Welch </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), and Welch\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In December 2013, Welch appeared <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i> before the District Court and filed a collateral challenge to his conviction and sentence through a motion under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255.  He argued, among other points, that his strong-arm robbery conviction itself was \xe2\x80\x9cvague\xe2\x80\x9d and that his counsel was ineffective for allowing him to be sentenced as an armed career criminal.  The District Court denied the motion and denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Still proceeding <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i>, Welch applied to the Court of Appeals for a certificate of appealability.  His application noted that <i>Johnson</i> was pending before this Court.  Welch argued, in part, that his \xe2\x80\x9carmed career offender status is unconstitutional and violate[s] [his]\n \nFifth Amendment right to notice of the state priors.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 20a.  Two months later, Welch filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals to hold his case in abeyance until <i>Johnson</i> could be decided, \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the fact he was sentenced under the [residual clause].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 15a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>In June 2015, the Court of Appeals entered a brief single-judge order denying the motion for a certificate of appealability.  Less than three weeks later, this Court issued its decision in <i>Johnson</i> holding, as already noted, that the residual clause is void for vagueness.  Welch filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals for additional time to seek reconsideration of its decision in light of <i>Johnson</i>, but the court returned that motion unfiled because Welch\xe2\x80\x99s time to seek reconsideration already had expired.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>Welch then filed a <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i> petition for certiorari.  His petition presented two questions: whether the District Court erred in denying his \xc2\xa72255 motion because his Florida robbery conviction does not qualify as a violent felony conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act; and whether <i>Johnson</i> announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.  Pet. for Cert. i.  This Court granted the petition.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).  Because the United States, as respondent, agrees with Welch that <i>Johnson</i> is retroactive, the Court appointed Helgi C. Walker as <i>amicus curiae</i> in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  She has ably discharged her responsibilities.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case comes to the Court in a somewhat unusual procedural posture.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, there can be no appeal from a final order in a \xc2\xa72255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).  A certificate of appealability may issue \xe2\x80\x9conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72253(c)(2).  That standard is met when \xe2\x80\x9creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 473,\n484 (2000)\n.  Obtaining a certificate of appealability \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require a showing that the appeal will succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca court of appeals should not decline the application .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. merely because it believes the applicant will not demonstrate an entitlement to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller-El </i>v. <i>Cockrell</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322,\n337 (2003)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The decision under review here is the single-judge order in which the Court of Appeals denied Welch a certificate of appealability.  Under the standard described above, that order determined not only that Welch had failed to show any entitlement to relief but also that reasonable jurists would consider that conclusion to be beyond all debate.  See <i>Slack</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 484. <i> </i>The narrow question here is whether the Court of Appeals erred in making that determination.  That narrow question, however, implicates a broader legal issue: whether <i>Johnson</i> is a substantive decision with retroactive effect in cases (like Welch\xe2\x80\x99s) on collateral review.  If so, then on the present record reasonable jurists could at least debate whether Welch should obtain relief in his collateral challenge to his sentence.  On these premises, the Court now proceeds to decide whether <i>Johnson</i> is retroactive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The normal framework for determining whether a new rule applies to cases on collateral review stems from the plurality opinion in <i>Teague </i>v. <i>Lane</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288 (1989)\n.  That opinion in turn drew on the approach outlined by the second Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in <i>Mackey </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 667 (1971)\n, and <i>Desist </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244 (1969)\n.  The parties here assume that the <i>Teague </i>framework applies in a federal collateral challenge to a federal conviction as it does in a federal collateral challenge to a state conviction, and we proceed on that assumption.  See <i>Chaidez </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa016 (2013); <i>Danforth </i>v. <i>Minnesota</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 264\n, n.\xc2\xa04 (2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Under <i>Teague</i>, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9cnew constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310.  <i>Teague</i> and its progeny recognize two categories of decisions that fall outside this general bar on retroactivity for procedural rules.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ew <i>substantive</i> rules generally apply retroactively.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schriro </i>v. <i>Summerlin</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 348,\n351 (2004)\n; see <i>Montgomery</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6);<i> Teague</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 307, 311.

The question here is whether that new rule falls within one of the two categories that have retroactive effect under <i>Teague</i>.  The parties agree that <i>Johnson</i> does not fall into the<i> </i>limited second category for watershed procedural rules.

Procedural rules, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cregulate only the <i>manner of determining</i> the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schriro</i>,<i> </i>542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353.  Such rules alter \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is punishable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal, but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 352.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under this framework, the rule announced in <i>Johnson</i> is substantive.  By striking down the residual clause as void for vagueness, <i>Johnson</i> changed the substantive reach of the Armed Career Criminal Act, altering \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of conduct or the class of persons that the [Act] punishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353.  Before <i>Johnson</i>, the Act applied to any person who possessed a firearm after three violent felony convictions, even if one or more of those convictions fell under only the residual clause.  An offender in that situation faced 15 years to life in prison.  After <i>Johnson</i>, the same person engaging in the same conduct is no longer subject to the Act and faces at most 10 years in prison.  The residual clause is invalid under <i>Johnson</i>, so it can no longer mandate or authorize any sentence.  <i>Johnson</i> establishes, in other words, that \xe2\x80\x9ceven the use of impeccable factfinding procedures could not legitimate\xe2\x80\x9d a sentence based on that clause.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>United\xc2\xa0States Coin &amp; Currency</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715,\n724 (1971)\n.  It follows that <i>Johnson </i>is a substantive decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By the same logic, <i>Johnson</i> is not a procedural decision.  <i>Johnson</i> had nothing to do with the range of permissible methods a court might use to determine whether a defendant should be sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act.  See <i>Schriro</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353.  It did not, for example, \xe2\x80\x9callocate decisionmaking authority\xe2\x80\x9d between judge and jury, <i>ibid.</i>, or regulate the evidence that the court could consider in making its decision, see <i>Whorton </i>v. <i>Bockting</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 406\n\xe2\x80\x93414, 417 (2007); <i>Mackey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 700\xe2\x80\x93701 (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Unlike those cases, <i>Johnson</i> affected the reach of the underlying statute rather than the judicial procedures by which the statute is applied.  <i>Johnson</i> is thus a substantive decision and so has retroactive effect under <i>Teague</i> in cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Amicus</i> urges the Court to adopt a different understanding of the <i>Teague </i>framework.  She contends courts should apply that framework by asking whether the constitu-tional right underlying the new rule is substantive or procedural.  Under that approach, <i>amicus</i> concludes that <i>Johnson </i>is a procedural decision because the void-for-vagueness doctrine that <i>Johnson </i>applied is based, she asserts, on procedural due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither <i>Teague</i> nor its progeny support that approach.  As described above, this Court has determined whether a new rule is substantive or procedural by considering the function of the rule, not its underlying constitutional source.  See, <i>e.g., Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 351\xe2\x80\x93353.  That is for good reason.  The <i>Teague</i> framework creates a balance between, first, the need for finality in criminal cases, and second, the countervailing imperative to ensure that criminal punishment is imposed only when authorized by law.  That balance turns on the function of the rule at issue, not the constitutional guarantee from which the rule derives.  If a new rule regulates only the procedures for determining culpability, the <i>Teague</i> balance generally tips in favor of finality.  The chance of a more accurate outcome under the new procedure normally does not justify the cost of vacating a conviction whose only flaw is that its procedures \xe2\x80\x9cconformed to then-existing constitutional standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Teague</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 310.  On the other hand, if a new rule changes the scope of the underlying criminal proscription, the balance is different.  A change of that character will \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of \xe2\x80\x98an act that the law does not make criminal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bousley</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614,\n620 (1998)\n (quoting <i>Davis</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333,\n346 (1974)\n).  By extension, where the conviction or sentence in fact is not authorized by substantive law, then finality interests are at their weakest.  As Justice Harlan wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is little societal interest in permitting the criminal process to rest at a point where it ought properly never to repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mackey</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 693 (opinion of Harlan, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Teague</i> balance thus does not depend on whether the underlying constitutional guarantee is characterized as procedural or substantive.  It depends instead on whether the new rule itself has a procedural function or a substantive function\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether it alters only the procedures used to obtain the conviction, or alters instead the range of conduct or class of persons that the law punishes.  See <i>Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353; <i>Montgomery</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  The emphasis by <i>amicus</i> on the constitutional guarantee behind the new rule, then, would untether the <i>Teague</i> framework from its basic purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The approach <i>amicus</i> suggests also would lead to results that cannot be squared with prior precedent.  Decisions from this Court show that a rule that is procedural for <i>Teague </i>purposes still can be grounded in a substantive constitutional guarantee.  For instance, the Court has adopted certain rules that regulate capital sentencing procedures in order to enforce the substantive guarantees of the\n \nEighth Amendment.  The consistent position has been that those rules are procedural, even though their ultimate source is substantive.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Beard </i>v. <i>Banks</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 406\n\xe2\x80\x93417 (2004); <i>Sawyer </i>v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227\n\xe2\x80\x93242 (1990).  From the converse perspective, there also can be substantive rules based on constitutional protections that, on the theory <i>amicus</i> advances, likely would be described as procedural.  For instance, a decision that invalidates as void for vagueness a statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cconduct annoying to persons passing by,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <i>Coates</i> v. <i>Cincinnati</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611,\n612,\n614 (1971)\n, would doubtless alter the range of conduct that the law prohibits.  That would make it a substantive decision under our precedent, see <i>Schriro</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353, even if the reasons for holding that statute invalid could be characterized as procedural.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amicus</i> next relies on language from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases describing substantive decisions as those that \xe2\x80\x9cplace particular conduct or persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. beyond the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to punish,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 352, or that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibi[t] a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Saffle</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 494 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Cases such as these, in which the Constitution deprives the Government of the power to impose the challenged punishment, \xe2\x80\x9crepresen[t] the clearest instance\xe2\x80\x9d of substantive rules for which retroactive application is appropriate.  <i>Mackey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 693 (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Drawing on those decisions, <i>amicus</i> argues that <i>Johnson</i> is not substantive because it does not limit Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power: Congress is free to enact a new version of the residual clause that imposes the same punishment on the same persons for the same conduct, provided the new statute is precise enough to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although this Court has put great emphasis on substantive decisions that place certain conduct, classes of persons, or punishments beyond the legislative power of Congress, the Court has also recognized that some substantive decisions do not impose such restrictions.  The clearest example comes from <i>Bousley</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In <i>Bousley</i>, the Court was asked to determine what retroactive effect should be given to its decision in <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (1995)\n.  <i>Bailey</i> considered the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d prong of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1), which imposes increased penalties on the use of a firearm in relation to certain crimes.  The Court held as a matter of statutory interpretation that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d prong punishes only \xe2\x80\x9cactive employment of the firearm\xe2\x80\x9d and not mere possession.  516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144.  The Court in <i>Bousley </i>had no difficulty concluding that <i>Bailey</i> was substantive, as it was a decision \xe2\x80\x9cholding that a substantive federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bousley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 620; see <i>Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 354 (\xe2\x80\x9cA decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court reached that conclusion even though Congress could (and later did) reverse <i>Bailey</i> by amending the statute to cover possession as well as use.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93233 (2010) (discussing statutory amendment known as the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Bailey </i>fix\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Bousley</i> thus contradicts the contention that the <i>Teague</i> inquiry turns only on whether the decision at issue holds that Congress lacks some substantive power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amicus</i> recognizes that <i>Bousley</i> does not fit the theory that, in her view, should control this case.  She instead proposes an ad\xc2\xa0hoc exception, contending that <i>Bousley</i> \xe2\x80\x9crecognized a separate subcategory of substantive rules\xe2\x80\x9d for decisions that interpret statutes (but not those, like <i>Johnson</i>, that invalidate statutes).  Brief for Court-Appointed <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in Support of Judgment Below 40.  For support, <i>amicus</i> looks to the separation-of-powers doctrine.  Her argument is that statutory construction cases are substantive because they define what Congress always intended the law to mean\xe2\x80\x94unlike <i>Johnson</i>, which struck down the residual clause regardless of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That argument is not persuasive.  Neither <i>Bousley </i>nor any other case from this Court treats statutory interpretation cases as a special class of decisions that are substantive because they implement the intent of Congress.  Instead, decisions that interpret a statute are substantive if and when they meet the normal criteria for a substantive rule: when they \xe2\x80\x9calte[r] the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schriro</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The separation-of-powers argument that <i>amicus </i>raises is also misplaced.  <i>Bousley</i> noted that the separation of powers prohibits a court from imposing criminal punishment beyond what Congress meant to enact.  523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 620\xe2\x80\x93621 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is only Congress, and not the courts, which can make conduct criminal\xe2\x80\x9d).  But a court likewise is prohibited from imposing criminal punishment beyond what Congress in fact has enacted by a valid law.  In either case a court lacks the power to exact a penalty that has not been authorized by any valid criminal statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Treating decisions as substantive if they involve statutory interpretation, but not if they involve statutory invalidation, would produce unusual outcomes.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt has long been our practice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Skilling</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358\n\xe2\x80\x93406 (2010).  <i>Amicus</i> acknowledges that a decision that saves a vague statute by adopting a limiting construction is substantive, so anyone who falls outside the limiting construction can use that decision to seek relief on collateral review.  But <i>amicus</i> also contends that, if a court takes the further step of striking down the whole statute as vague, that decision is procedural, so no one can use it to seek relief on collateral review.  That arbitrary distinction has no place in the <i>Teague</i> framework.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It should be noted, of course, that not every decision striking down a statute is <i>ipso facto</i> a substantive decision.  A decision that strikes down a procedural statute\xe2\x80\x94for example, a statute regulating the types of evidence that can be presented at trial\xe2\x80\x94would itself be a proce-dural decision. It would affect only the \xe2\x80\x9cmanner of determining the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability,\xe2\x80\x9d not the conduct or persons to be punished.  <i>Schriro</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353 (emphasis deleted).  A decision of this kind would have no retroactive effect under <i>Teague</i> unless it could be considered a \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d procedural rule.  See <i>Teague</i>, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311\xe2\x80\x93313.  <i>Johnson</i>, however, struck down part of a criminal statute that regulates conduct and prescribes punishment.  It thereby altered \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schriro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353.  It follows that <i>Johnson</i> announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It may well be that the Court of Appeals on remand will determine on other grounds that the District Court was correct to deny Welch\xe2\x80\x99s motion to amend his sentence.  For instance, the parties continue to dispute whether Welch\xe2\x80\x99s strong-arm robbery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the elements clause of the Act, which would make Welch eligible for a 15-year sentence regardless of <i>Johnson</i>.  On the present record, however, and in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding that <i>Johnson</i> is retroactive in cases on collateral review, reasonable jurists at least could debate whether Welch is entitled to relief.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</i></b></b></b></div><b><b><b><i>\n</i></b></b></b></div><b><b><b><i>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3559744">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x936418</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">GREGORY WELCH, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[April 18, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Last Term the Court held in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), that because the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA),\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), \xe2\x80\x9ccombin[es] indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d it is unconstitutionally vague.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).

The majority also misconstrues the retroactivity framework developed in <i>Teague</i> v. <i>Lane</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288 (1989)\n, and its progeny, thereby undermining any principled limitation on the finality of federal convictions.

This case arises from petitioner Gregory Welch\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a certificate of appealability.  \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).  In other words, Welch asks the Court to review the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to allow him to appeal the claims he raised in a motion to vacate his sentence and lost in the District Court.  But Welch never claimed that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague in his \xc2\xa72255 motion, let alone that <i>Johnson </i>applies retroactively.  Accordingly, courts below addressed neither issue.  Indeed, <i>Johnson </i>was not even decided when the courts below issued their rulings.  Those deficiencies should preclude us from deciding in this case whether <i>Johnson </i>is retroactive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our role in reviewing the denial of a certificate of appealability is far more circumscribed than normal appellate review.  The text of\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253 confirms this.  Defendants can appeal their convictions and sentences as a matter of right on direct review, but \xc2\xa72253 deprives courts of appeals of jurisdiction to review the denial of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for federal postconviction relief unless he obtains a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of appealability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).  And he can obtain that certificate only if he makes \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72253(c)(2); see <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Cockrell</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322\n\xe2\x80\x93336 (2003).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, this Court has instructed that review of the denial of a certificate of appealability is a retrospective inquiry into whether the movant\xe2\x80\x99s claims, as litigated in the district court, warrant further proceedings\xe2\x80\x94not whether there is any conceivable basis upon which the movant could prevail.  Courts must ask whether \xe2\x80\x9creason-able jurists would find <i>the district court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment</i> ofthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 473,\n484 (2000)\n (emphasis added).  They are to \xe2\x80\x9clook to the <i>District Court\xe2\x80\x99s </i>application of [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)] to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claims and ask whether <i>that </i>resolution was debatable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller-El, supra,</i> at 336 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Until today, we did not require courts of appeals to consider all possible constitutional issues that might warrant relief as part of this inquiry.  Those courts instead looked to how the movant framed his case in his motion to vacate.  Even if, for example, a district court denies ha-beas relief based on procedural default and never reached the merits, the movant must establish not only that the procedural ruling is \xe2\x80\x9cdebatable\xe2\x80\x9d but<i> also</i> that his motion \xe2\x80\x9cstate[d] a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Slack, supra,</i> at 484.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Requiring a court of appeals to consider arguments not raised in a \xc2\xa72255 motion is also at odds with how the Court has described the certificate-of-appealability inquiry.  The Court has called the decision whether to grant a certificate of appealability a \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry that \xe2\x80\x9cforbids\xe2\x80\x9d reviewing courts to engage in \xe2\x80\x9cfull consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller-El</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 336.  That is because, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the point of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [certificate of appealability] process [is to] scree[n] out issues unworthy of judicial time and attention and ensur[e] that frivolous claims are not assigned to merits panels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134,\n145 (2012)\n.  There would be no surer way to transform this determination into a full-blown merits appeal than to require courts of appeals to consider all conceivable bases for relief that the movant failed to raise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Welch\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise any <i>Johnson-</i>related<i> </i>claim in the District Court should, therefore, bar the Eleventh Circuit and this Court from addressing whether <i>Johnson </i>applies retroactively.  Welch\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72255 motion omitted any claim</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">that his sentence was invalid because the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*  Unsurprisingly, the District Court did not address a vagueness claim that Welch had not raised.  Nor did (or could) the District Court assess whether <i>Johnson </i>applies retroactively, for we decided <i>Johnson </i>after the District Court ruling.  In sum, when Welch raised the vagueness of the residual clause for the first time in his Eleventh Circuit application for a certificate of appealability, it was too late.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The Government responds to this issue by attempting, in its reply brief in this Court, to \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly waiv[e] any procedural default defense against petitioner on his <i>Johnson </i>claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for United States 22.

Cf. <i>Butler</i> v. <i>McKellar</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 407,\n415 (1990)\n (deciding that a new rule was not substantive because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proscribed conduct\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9ccapital murder, the prosecution of which is, to put it mildly, not prohibited by the rule\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor does <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness rule place any class of persons or punishment off limits.  There is no category of offender that Congress cannot subject to an enhanced sentence after <i>Johnson.  </i>See <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n230 (2007)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting) (Congress \xe2\x80\x9cvery easily\xe2\x80\x9d could \xe2\x80\x9csubjec[t] all repeat offenders to a 15-year manda-tory minimum prison term\xe2\x80\x9d in differently worded statute (emphasis deleted)).

The Court thus classified decisions \xe2\x80\x9cholding that a substantive federal criminal statute does not reach certain conduct\xe2\x80\x9d as substantive.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would not so readily assume that <i>Bousley </i>applies here.<i> </i>Until today, <i>Bousley </i>applied only to new rules reinterpreting the text of federal criminal statutes in a way that narrows their reach.  <i>Johnson</i> announced no such rule.  It announced only that there is no way in which to narrow the reach of the residual clause without running afoulof the Due Process Clause.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9312).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority protests that applying different retroactivity principles to constitutional and statutory rules pro-duces \xe2\x80\x9cunusual outcomes\xe2\x80\x9d because a decision interpreting a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text to narrow its scope may be retroactive, while a decision declaring the provision unconstitutional might not be.  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  But such outcomes are an inevitable byproduct of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity jurisprudence, not a unique consequence of this case.  Take a statute allowing the Federal Government to prosecute defendants for \xe2\x80\x9cserious crimes involving interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d of which they were acquitted in state court.  See <i>Bartkus</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 121 (1959)\n (no double jeopardy bar to such prosecutions).  Suppose the Court, concerned that there might be a double jeopardy problem after all,<i> </i>narrowed the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cserious crimes involving interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass only felonies that would be subject to a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  Anyone acquitted of a minor felony by the State but convicted by the Federal Government before this Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrowing construction could, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, seek relief on collateral review under <i>Bousley</i>.  See <i>ante,</i> at 14.  But if the Court ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars <i>all</i> federal reprosecutions, I doubt that rule would be retroactive.  That rule dictates <i>when</i> a defendant may be tried and convicted of certain conduct\xe2\x80\x94not the substance of the crime for which the defendant is tried, or the punishment imposed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s historical justifications for retroactivity underscore the reasons for treating statutory and constitutional rules differently.  The Court in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cextend[ed] the scope of habeas to all alleged constitutional errors\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cforc[e] trial and appellate courts in both the federal and state system to toe the constitutional mark\xe2\x80\x9d in the face of perceived systemic violations.  <i>Mackey</i> v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 667,\n687 (1971)\n (Harlan, J., concurringin judgments in part and dissenting in part).  That development led to the <i>Teague </i>framework allowing retroactivity for certain types of constitutional rules.  See <i>Montgomery</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2016) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933) (recounting history).  But this Court has never suggested that lower courts had similar difficulties in interpreting the reach of criminal statutes, such that the retroactivity rules should be the same.  Rather, the history suggests that the failure to apply a narrowing construction of a criminal statute is a qualitatively different type of error.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority instead determines whether a rule is substantive by looking to the \xe2\x80\x9cfunction of the rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 10, and asking \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the new rule itself has a procedural function or a substantive function,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 11.  This apparently means that courts should divine the <i>effect</i> of a new rule and decide whether that effect alters the substantive elements of a crime or sentence.  All that matters, the majority says, is that the vagueness rule announced in <i>Johnson</i> had the <i>effect</i> of invalidating the residual clause and, as a result of its invalidation, the residual clause \xe2\x80\x9ccan no longer mandate or authorize any sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9cstriking down the residual clause\xe2\x80\x9d is what \xe2\x80\x9cchanged the substantive reach of [ACCA]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That approach is untenable.  It brushes aside the rule of decision, which is where all of our prior precedents begin and end for purposes of applying <i>Teague</i>.  When deciding whether rules are substantive, our cases have homed in on the rule that would apply not just to the specific statute at hand, but in similar, future circumstances.  Thus, just this Term, the Court defined the rule announced in <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), as: The\n \nEighth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. mandatory life without parole for juvenile offenders\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not that Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile-sentencing statute flouts the\n \nEighth Amendment.  <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Likewise, the rule announced in <i>Ring</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584 (2002)\n, was that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not that provisions of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty statute violate the\n \nSixth Amendment.  <i>Schriro</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  By jettisoning that approach and focusing solely on <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s effect (the invalidationof the residual clause), the majority departs from our precedents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the <i>effect </i>of a decision breaks down all meaningful distinctions between \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d rules, or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d ones.  The first step of the <i>Teague </i>inquiry assesses whether the ruleis \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d by looking to whether prior precedents dictated the rule of decision\xe2\x80\x94not its effects.  See, <i>e.g., Chaidez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But if, as the majority contends, the \xe2\x80\x9cfunction of the rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 10, is the relevant baseline, then <i>every </i>case invalidating a statute or a sentence establishes a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d rule.  The law\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation would be a departure from any prior decision that interpreted the law as if it were operative.  Likewise, if any decision has the effect of invalidating substantive provisions of a criminal statute, it is a substantive rule under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach no matter what the reason for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The majority denies that \xe2\x80\x9cevery decision striking down a statute is <i>ipso facto</i> a substantive decision,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that only when a decision invalidates a provision that \xe2\x80\x9cregulates conduct and prescribes punishment\xe2\x80\x9d is it retroactive.  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  But that still transforms innumerable procedural rules into substantive ones.  Take a state law that defines the crime of robbery and specifies that only 10 of the 12 jurors need to vote to convict someone of that crime.  If this Court were to reverse <i>Apodaca</i> v. <i>Oregon</i>,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 404 (1972)\n, and hold that the\n \nSixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts, the portion of the statute allowing nonunanimity would be invalid.  But assume that the state statute was nonseverable: the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury unanim-ity rule, undoubtedly \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural,\xe2\x80\x9d would have the effect of invalidating not only the portion of the state statute regarding unanimity but also the provision defining the crime of robbery, a provision that \xe2\x80\x9cregulates conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  To the majority, these effects would make the rule substantive.  That approach is mistaken, and would also produce arbitrary results.  Suppose most States had similar statutes, but that some had robust severability provisions and others did not.  In some States, the decision would be procedural; elsewhere, it would be substantive, producing a patchwork of statute-specific outcomes.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority flips <i>Teague </i>on its head with its alternative contention that <i>Johnson </i>must have announced a substantive rule because it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a procedural decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  <i>Teague </i>is a general rule against retroactivity, see <i>ante,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938, and all new rules are barred unless they fit within the exceptions for substantive or \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d procedural rules.  489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311 (plurality opinion).

There, Justice Harlan con-fronted a now-familiar problem: how to address the con-sequences of an ever-evolving Constitution.

In his view, very few rules that emerged after a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction\xe2\x80\x94including constitutional rules\xe2\x80\x94warranted disturbing that conviction.  See <i>id.,</i> at 686\xe2\x80\x93692.  Justice Harlan saw only \xe2\x80\x9ctwo exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cbedrock procedural\xe2\x80\x9d rules, <i>id.,</i> at 692\xe2\x80\x93693, and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ew \xe2\x80\x98substantive due process\xe2\x80\x99 rules\xe2\x80\x9d removing \xe2\x80\x9ccertain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 692.  As examples of the latter category, he cited such rules as that the\n \nFirst Amendment forbids criminalizing flag burning, that the right to privacy precludes the Government from prosecuting distributors of contraception, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom to marry\xe2\x80\x9d and equal protection principles immunize couples from being punished for entering into interracial marriages.  <i>Id., </i>at 692, n. 7.
