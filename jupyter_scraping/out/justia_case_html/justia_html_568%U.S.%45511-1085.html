The District Court certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Ninth Circuit rejected Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Connecticut Retirement was required to prove the materiality of Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had presented on the issue of materiality at the class-certification stage.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a securities-fraud class action seeking money damages for alleged violations of \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.

For two reasons, the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, because materiality is judged according to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence common to the class.  TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438\n.  Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.  Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality would not result in individual questions predominating.  Instead, it would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a securities-fraud claim.

John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, that \xe2\x80\x9csecurities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption of reliance,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cthat the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , that the stock traded in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place \xe2\x80\x98between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality\xe2\x80\x94another fraud-on-the-market predicate\xe2\x80\x94should be treated no differently.  The Court disagrees.  The requirement that a putative class representative establish that it executed trades \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed\xe2\x80\x9d relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry.  And unlike materiality, market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispensable elements of a Rule 10\xe2\x80\x935 claim.  While the failure of common, classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.

Because class certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at the class-certification stage.  In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim, notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims are based were false or misleading and that the alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss.  Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory.  And contrary to Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s position would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materiality at the class-certification stage.

The Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s complaint were immaterial.  The potential immateriality of Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common questions predominate.  Just as a plaintiff class\xe2\x80\x99s inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

Seeking class-action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Connecticut Retirement invoked the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d presumption endorsed by this Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1988)\n, and recog- nized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  The fraud-on-the-market premise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient market will reflect all publicly available information about a company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be presumed to have relied on that information in purchasing the security.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for the securities at issue and has not contested the public character of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is based.  Nor does Amgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets all of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a): (1) the alleged class \xe2\x80\x9cis so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthere are questions of law or fact common to the class\xe2\x80\x9d; (3) Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s claims are \xe2\x80\x9ctypical of the claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the class\xe2\x80\x9d; and (4) Connecticut Retirement will \xe2\x80\x9cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe issue presented concerns the requirement stated in Rule 23(b)(3) that \xe2\x80\x9cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amgen contends that to meet the predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement must do more than plausibly plead that Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and misleading omissions materially affected Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s stock price.  According to Amgen, certification must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement proves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or omissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s stock price in an efficient market.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove materiality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such proof is not a prerequisite to class certification.  Rule 23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be answered, on the merits, in favor of the class.  Because materiality is judged according to an objective standard, the materiality of Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and omissions is a question common to all members of the class Connecticut Retirement would represent.  The alleged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material or immaterial, would be so equally for all investors composing the class.  As vital, the plaintiff class\xe2\x80\x99s inability to prove materiality would not result in individual questions predominating.  Instead, a failure of proof on the issue of materiality would end the case, given that materiality is an essential element of the class members\xe2\x80\x99 securities-fraud claims.  As to materiality, therefore, the class is entirely cohesive: It will prevail or fail in unison.  In no event will the individual circumstances of particular class members bear on the inquiry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEssentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, would have us put the cart before the horse.  To gain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the dissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first establish that it will win the fray.  But the office of a Rule 23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case; rather, it is to select the \xe2\x80\x9cmetho[d]\xe2\x80\x9d best suited to adjudication of the controversy \xe2\x80\x9cfairly and efficiently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case involves the interaction between federal  securities-fraud laws and Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for  class certification.  To obtain certification of a class ac- tion for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff must satisfy Rule 23(a)\xe2\x80\x99s above-mentioned prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation, see supra, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and must also establish that \xe2\x80\x9cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  To recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \n\n48Stat.\n891, as amended, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V), and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2011), a plaintiff must prove \xe2\x80\x9c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.

Accordingly, in Basic the Court endorsed the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d theory, which permits certain Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance on material misrepresentations aired to the general public.

Few investors in such markets, if any, can consistently achieve above-market returns by trading based on publicly available information alone, for if such above-market returns were readily attainable, it would mean that market prices were not efficiently incorporating the full supply of public information.  See R. Brealey, S. Myers, &amp; F. Allen, Principles of Corporate Finance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n an efficient market, there is no way for most investors to achieve consistently superior rates of return.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be efficient, courts may presume that investors who traded securities in that market relied on public, material misrepresentations regarding those securities.  See 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 245\xe2\x80\x93247.  This presumption springs from the very concept of market efficiency.  If a market is generally efficient in incorporating publicly available information into a security\xe2\x80\x99s market price, it is reasonable to presume that a particular public, material misrepresentation will be reflected in the security\xe2\x80\x99s price.  Furthermore, it is reasonable to presume that most investors\xe2\x80\x94knowing that they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information\xe2\x80\x94will rely on the security\xe2\x80\x99s market price as an unbiased assessment of the security\xe2\x80\x99s value in light of all public information.

Absent the fraud-on-the-market theory, the requirement that Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiffs establish reliance would ordinarily preclude certification of a class action seeking money dam- ages because individual reliance issues would overwhelm questions common to the class.  See Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242.  The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, facilitates class certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance on public, material misrepresentations when shares are traded in an efficient market.

First, Amgen contended that the District Court erred by certifying the proposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retirement to prove that Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and omissions were material.  Second, Amgen argued that the District Court erred by refusing to consider certain rebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition to Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s class-certification motion.  This evidence, in Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s view, demonstrated that the market was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the time the class members purchased their shares.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.  Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made the uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresentations and omissions \xe2\x80\x9cby definition [do] not affect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. stock price[s] in an efficient market.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1175.  Thus, where misrepresentations and omissions are not material, there is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on those misrepresentations and omissions through the information-processing mechanism of the market price.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem with that argument,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals ob-served, is evident: \xe2\x80\x9c[B]ecause materiality is an element of the merits of their securities fraud claim, the plaintiffs cannot both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable claim for which they would need to prove reliance individually.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cproof of materiality is not necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure compliance with Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that common questions predominate.

As Amgen notes, materiality is not only an element of the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action; it is also an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market theory.  See Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 247 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here materially misleading statements have been disseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market for securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is premised on the understanding that in an efficient market, all publicly available information is rapidly incorporated into, and thus transmitted to investors through, the market price.  See id., at 246\xe2\x80\x93247.  Because immaterial in- formation, by definition, does not affect market price, it cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as the fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar- ket price\xe2\x80\x99s integrity.  Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market theory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation or omission.  And without the fraud-on-the-market theory, the element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide basis through evidence common to the class.  See id., at 242.  It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality must be proved before a securities-fraud class action can be certified.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the key question in this case is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Instead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate over any questions affecting only individual members\xe2\x80\x9d as the litigation progresses.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023(b)(3).  For two reasons, the answer to this question is clearly \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question of materiality .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is an objective one, involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,\xe2\x80\x9d materiality can be proved through evidence common to the class.  TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438, \n445 (1976)\n.  Consequently, materiality is a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon questio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).  Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242 (listing \xe2\x80\x9cmateriality\xe2\x80\x9d as one of the questions common to the Basic class members).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof on the common question of materiality will result in individual questions predominating.  Because materiality is an essential element of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim, see Matrixx Initiatives, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present sufficient evidence of materiality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail at trial would not cause individual reliance questions to overwhelm the questions common to the class.  Instead, the failure of proof on the element of materiality would end the case for one and for all; no claim would re- main in which individual reliance issues could potentially predominate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTotally misapprehending our essential point, Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent asserts that our \xe2\x80\x9centire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it will be proved later on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 11, n.\xc2\xa09.  Our position is not so based.  We rest, instead, entirely on the text of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification if \xe2\x80\x9cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\xe2\x80\x9d  A failure of proof on the common question of materiality ends the litigation and thus will never cause individual questions of reliance or anything else to overwhelm questions common to the class.  Therefore, under the plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not required to prove materiality at the class-certification stage.  In other words, they need not, at that threshold, prove that the predominating question will be answered in their favor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Thomas urges that a plaintiff seeking class certification \xe2\x80\x9cmust show that the elements of [her] claim are susceptible to classwide proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 7.

From this premise, Justice Thomas concludes that Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiffs must prove material- ity before class certification because (1) \xe2\x80\x9cmateriality is a necessary component of fraud on the market,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) without fraud on the market, the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 element of reliance is not \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of a classwide answer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 6, 10\xe2\x80\x9311.

Thus, a plaintiff whose relevant transactions were not executed between the time the misrepresentation was made and the time the truth was revealed cannot be said to have indirectly relied on the misrepresentation through its reliance on the integrity of the market price.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Such a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims, therefore, would not be \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d of the claims of investors who did trade during the window between misrepresentation and truth revelation.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023(a)(3).  Nor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff would \xe2\x80\x9cfairly and adequately protect the interests\xe2\x80\x9d of investors who traded during the relevant window.  Rule 23(a)(4).  The requirement that the fraud-on-the-market theory\xe2\x80\x99s trade-timing predicate be established before class certification thus sheds little light on the question whether materiality must also be proved at the class-certification stage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmgen is not aided by Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s statement that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations must be proved before a securities-fraud class action can be certified.  As Amgen notes, market efficiency, publicity, and materiality can all be proved on a classwide basis.  Furthermore, they are all essential predicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory.  Unless those predicates are established, there is no basis for presuming that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations were reflected in the security\xe2\x80\x99s market price, and hence no grounding for any contention that investors indirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their reliance on the integrity of the market price.  But unlike materiality, market efficiency and publicity are not indispensable elements of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim.  See Matrixx Initiatives, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (listing elements of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim).  Thus, where the market for a security is inefficient or the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations were not aired publicly, a plaintiff cannot invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption.  She can, however, attempt to establish reliance through the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d mode of demonstrating that she was personally \xe2\x80\x9caware of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] statement and engaged in a relevant transaction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. based on that specific misrepresentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Halliburton, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Individualized reliance issues would predominate in such a lawsuit.  See Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242.  The litigation, therefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a class action, but the initiating plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim would remain live; it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cdead on arrival.\xe2\x80\x9d  660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1175.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast, not only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim.  Materiality thus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity predicates in this critical respect: While the failure of common, classwide proof on the issues of market efficiency and publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of materiality ends the case for the class and for all indi- viduals alleged to compose the class.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnless the failure of common proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof, it does not cast doubt on the propriety of class certification.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, there can be no actionable reliance, individually or collectively, on immaterial information.  Be- cause a failure of proof on the issue of materiality, unlike the issues of market efficiency and publicity, does not give rise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming common ones, materiality need not be proved prior to Rule 23(b)(3) class certification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmgen also contends that certain \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy considerations\xe2\x80\x9d militate in favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality.

Absent a requirement to evaluate materiality at the class-certification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never be addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender and settle soon after a class is certified.  Insistence on proof of materiality before certifying a securities-fraud class action, Amgen thus urges, ensures that the issue will be adjudicated and not forgone.

In reality, however, it is Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s position, not the judgments of the lower courts in this case, that would waste judicial resources.  Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s argument, if embraced, would necessitate a mini-trial on the issue of materiality at the class-certification stage.  Such preliminary adjudications would entail considerable expenditures of judicial time and resources, costs scarcely anticipated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A), which instructs that the decision whether to certify a class action be made \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t an early practicable time.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the class is certified, materiality might have to be shown all over again at trial.

The Court of Appeals concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement\xe2\x80\x99s complaint were immaterial.  660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1177 (characterizing Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttal evidence as an attempt to present a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98truth-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x99 defense,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Court of Appeals explained \xe2\x80\x9cis a method of refuting an alleged misrepresentation\xe2\x80\x99s materiality\xe2\x80\x9d).

As explained above, however, the potential immateriality of Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misrepresentations and omissions is no barrier to finding that common questions predominate.  See Part II, supra.  If the alleged misrepresentations and omissions are ultimately found immaterial, the fraud-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance will collapse.  But again, as earlier explained, see supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313, individual reliance questions will not overwhelm questions common to the class, for the class members\xe2\x80\x99 claims will have failed on their merits, thus bringing the litigation to a close.  Therefore, just as a plaintiff class\xe2\x80\x99s inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe recognized as much in Basic itself.

For example, a market may more readily process certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible information, such as public merger announcements, than information more difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical data buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  See, e.g., Macey &amp; Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of the Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan.

Amgen, however, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency bolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof of materiality.

The Court does so by all but eliminating materiality as one of the predicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory, which serves as an alternative mode of es-tablishing reliance.  See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224\n\xe2\x80\x93250 (1988).  Without demonstrating materiality at certification, plaintiffs cannot establish Basic\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market presumption.  Without proof of fraud on the market, plaintiffs cannot show that otherwise individualized questions of reliance will predominate, as required by Rule 23(b)(3).  And without satisfying Rule 23(b)(3), class certification is improper.  Fraud on the market is thus a condition precedent to class certification, without which individualized questions of reliance will defeat certification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion depends on the following assumption: Plaintiffs will either (1) establish materiality at the merits stage, in which case class certification was proper because reliance turned out to be a common question, or (2) fail to establish materiality, in which case the claim would fail on the merits, notwithstanding the fact that the class should not have been certified in the first place, because reliance was never a common question.  The failure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms that fraud on the market was never established, that questions regarding the element of reliance were not common under Rule 23(b)(3), and, by extension, that certification was never proper.  Plaintiffs cannot be excused of their Rule 23 burden to show at certification that questions of reliance are common merely because they might lose later on the merits element of materiality.  Because a securities-fraud plaintiff invoking Basic\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market presumption to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) should be required to prove each of the predicates of that theory at certification in order to demonstrate that questions of reliance are common to the class, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with \xc2\xa710 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We \xe2\x80\x9chave implied a private cause of action from the text and purposes of \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x9d and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2011).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.

The materiality of a specific statement is, therefore, essential to the fraud-on-the-market presumption, which in turn enables a plaintiff to prove reliance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBasic\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market presumption is highly sig-nificant because it makes securities-fraud class actions possible by converting the inherently individual reliance inquiry into a question common to the class, which is necessary to satisfy the dictates of Rule 23(b)(3).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Rule 23(b)(3) requires the party seeking certification to prove that \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\xe2\x80\x9d  A plaintiff seeking class certification is not required to prove the elements of his claim at the certifi-cation stage, but he must show that the elements of the claim are susceptible to classwide proof.  See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa06 (2011) (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa06) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certifi-cation must prove that their shares were traded on an ef-ficient market,\xe2\x80\x9d an element of the fraud-on-the-market theory (emphasis added)).

For if reliance is not a common question, each plaintiff would be required to prove that he in fact relied on a misstatement, a showing which is simply not susceptible to classwide proof.  Individuals make stock transactions for divergent, even idiosyncratic, reasons.  As the leading pre-Basic fraud-on-the-market case recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] purchaser on the stock exchanges may be either unaware of a specific false representation, or may not directly rely on it; he may purchase because of a favorable price trend, price earnings ratio, or some other factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.\xc2\xa02d 891, 907 (CA9 1975).  The inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s inherently individualized nature renders it impossible to generate the common answers necessary for certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  See Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242 (\xe2\x80\x9cRequiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would have prevented respondents from proceeding with a class action, since individual issues then would have overwhelmed the common ones\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution in Basic was to allow putative class members to prove reliance through the fraud-on-the-market presumption.  Id., at 241\xe2\x80\x93250.  As the Court today recognizes, failure to establish fraud on the market \xe2\x80\x9cleaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both acknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the presumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-on-the-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the market was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged misstatement was public.  See ante, at 16 (acknowledging \xe2\x80\x9cthat market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations must be proved before a securities-fraud class action can be certified\xe2\x80\x9d); 660 F.\xc2\xa03d 1170, 1175 (CA9 2011) (same).  See also Erica P. John Fund, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove,\xe2\x80\x9d at certification inter alia, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [and] that the stock traded in an efficient market\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court is correct insofar as its statements recognize that fraud on the market is a condition precedent to showing that there are common questions of reliance at the time of class certification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality\xe2\x80\x94by its own admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud on the market\xe2\x80\x94need not be established at certification because it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  This assertion is an express admission that parties will not know at certification whether reliance is an individual or common question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo support its position, the Court transforms the predicate certification inquiry into a novel either-or inquiry occurring much later on the merits.  According to the Court, either (1) plaintiffs will prove materiality on the merits, thus demonstrating ex\xc2\xa0post that common questions predominated at certification, or (2) they will fail to prove materiality, at which point we learn ex\xc2\xa0post that certification was inappropriate because reliance was not, in fact, a common question.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s second scenario, fraud on the market was never established, reliance for each class member was inherently individualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Court suggests that the problem created by the second scenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose anyway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be over.  See ante, at 17 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ailure of proof on the issue of materiality [at the merits stage] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  But nothing in logic or precedent justifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is susceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because one predicate of reliance\xe2\x80\x94materiality\xe2\x80\x94will be resolved, if at all, much later in the litigation on an independent merits element.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is the Court, not Amgen, that \xe2\x80\x9cwould have us put the cart before the horse,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3, by jumping chronologically to the \xc2\xa710(b) merits element of materiality.  But Rule 23, as well as common sense, requires class certification issues to be addressed first.  See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9cAt an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action\xe2\x80\x9d).  A plaintiff who cannot prove materiality does not simply have a claim that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dead on arrival\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d at the merits, ante, at 17 (quoting 660 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1175); he has a class that should never have arrived at the merits at all because it failed Rule 23(b)(3) certification from the outset.  Without materiality, there is no fraud- on-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain individualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossible.  And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both fraud on the market at certification and an independent merits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a court at certification may inquire into questions that also have later relevance on the merits.  See 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311).  The Court reverses that inquiry, effectively saying that certification may be put off until later because an adverse merits determination will retroactively wipe out the entire class.  However, a plaintiff who cannot prove materiality cannot prove fraud on the market and, thus, cannot demonstrate that the question of reliance is susceptible of a classwide answer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that a statement may prove to be material at the merits stage does not justify conflating the doctrinally independent (and distinct) elements of materiality and reliance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s error occurs when, instead of asking whether the element of reliance is susceptible to classwide proof, the Court focuses on whether materiality is susceptible to classwide proof.  Ante, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he piv-otal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will \xe2\x80\x98predominate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The result is that the Court effectively equates \xc2\xa710(b) materiality with fraud-on-the-market materiality and elides reliance as a \xc2\xa710(b) element.  But a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23 bears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements of a \xc2\xa710(b) claim, which includes materiality and reliance.  As Wal-Mart explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule\xe2\x80\x94that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  If the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at certification, a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of establishing that questions of individualized reliance will not predominate, without which the plaintiff class cannot obtain certification.  Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (holding in Rule 23(a)(2) context that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout some glue hold- ing the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\xe2\x80\x99 claims for relief will produce a common answer\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is only by establishing all of the elements of the fraud-on-the-market presumption that reliance can be proved on a classwide basis.  Therefore, if a plaintiff wishes to use Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption to prove that reliance is a common question, he must establish the entire presumption, including materiality, at the class certification stage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is it relevant, as respondent argues, that requiring plaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market at certification will make it more difficult to obtain certification.  See Brief for Respondent 35\xe2\x80\x9338.  In Basic, four Justices of a six-Justice Court created the fraud-on-the-market presumption from a combination of newly minted economic theories, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 250\xe2\x80\x93251, n. 1 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations of fairness, public policy, and probability,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 245 (majority opinion), to allow claims that otherwise would have been barred due to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 inability to show reliance, id., at 242.  Basic is a judicially invented doctrine based on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden on plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of action.  There is nothing untoward about requiring plaintiffs to take the steps that the Basic Court created in an effort to save otherwise inadequate claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach is, thus, doctrinally incorrect under Basic.  Its shortcomings are further highlighted by the role that materiality played in the pre-Basic development of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition precedent to showing that there are common questions of reliance in the class-action context.  Materiality, at the time of certification, has been a driving force behind the theory from the outset.  This fact further supports the need to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-the-market theory is invoked to show that questions of reliance can be answered on a classwide basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts applying the fraud-on-the-market theory.  Both demonstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not a mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons for allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed aside at certification.  This fact weighs strongly in favor of the conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certi-fication when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is invoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first signpost was the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s 1975 opinion in Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the \xe2\x80\x9cseminal fraud on the market case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Peil, 806 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1163, n. 16.  See also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory cited by the Court is Blackie v.

In resultant class actions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the way of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it was not a common question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit disagreed.  Instead, it relieved plaintiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, ex-plaining that \xe2\x80\x9ccausation is adequately established in the impersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and of the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof of reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 906 (emphasis added).  The court left no doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall in Ampex\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements was central to its determination that reliance could be presumed.  It asserted that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reliance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the stock price\xe2\x80\x94when the purchase is made[,] the causational chain between defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s loss is sufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Materiality was not merely an important factor that allowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiality was the factor.  It demonstrated that the defendants had committed a fraud on the market, that all putative class plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and, therefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible to common answers.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second fraud-on-the-market signpost prior to Basic was a note in the Harvard Law Review, which described the nascent theory.  See Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982) (hereinafter Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. Note).  The Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic termed the Note \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he clearest statement of the theory of presumption of reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F.\xc2\xa02d 741, 750 (1986).  Indeed, in the briefing for Basic itself, the plaintiffs, the United States, and plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 amicus cited the article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the subject.  See Brief for Respondent 43, n. 18, 46, n. 20 (cited in Peil, supra, at 1160), Brief for Securities and Exchange Commission as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 25, 24, n. 30, 26, n. 32, and Brief for Joseph Harris et\xc2\xa0al. as Amicus Curiae 4, n. 2, in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86\xe2\x80\x93279.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike Blackie, the Note also hinged the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance on proof of materiality.  Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. Note 1161 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn developed markets, which are apparently efficient, reliance should be presumed from the materiality of the deception\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Ultimately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who has read Basic, the Note formulated a \xe2\x80\x9cpivotal assumption\xe2\x80\x9d underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the belief that:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cmarket prices respond to information disseminated (or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose securities are traded.  In such a setting\xe2\x80\x94often described as an \xe2\x80\x98efficient market\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the reliance of some traders upon a material deception influences market prices and thereby affects even traders who never read or hear of the deception.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harv.

As a result, without materiality it is impossible to say that there has been a fraud on the market at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to believe that the market price at which stock transactions occurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by extension, that any market participants relied on it.  Materiality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is invoked, or there is no common-ality with respect to questions of reliance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor did the importance of materiality diminish in the Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic.  Rather, the court followed the path marked by the signposts discussed above.  It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evidence of reliance, so long as \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant is shown to have made a material public misrepresentation that, if relied on directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to mis-judge the value of the stock.\xe2\x80\x9d  Levinson, 786 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 750 (emphasis added).  The court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis made clear that materiality should be demonstrated at the time the presumption was invoked: \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to invoke the presumption of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory, a plaintiff must allege and prove .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the mis-representations were material .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. .\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Materiality was central to the development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market theory both before Basic and in Basic itself.  Materiality, therefore, must be demonstrated to prove fraud on the market, and until materiality of an alleged misstatement is shown there is no reason to believe that all market participants have relied equally on it.  Otherwise individualized questions of reliance remain.  This history confirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the theory is invoked\xe2\x80\x94i.e., at certification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI, thus, would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and hold that a plaintiff invoking the fraud-on-the-market presumption bears the burden to establish all the elements of fraud on the market at certification, including the materiality of the alleged misstatement.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Section 10 states, in relevant part:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\xe2\x80\x94\n.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\n\xe2\x80\x9c(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange . . . any manipu-lative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe . .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 states:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,\n\xe2\x80\x9c(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,\n\xe2\x80\x9c(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or\n\xe2\x80\x9c(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Courts have also \xe2\x80\x9creferred to the element of reliance as \xe2\x80\x98transaction causation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Erica P.

But it is also necessary to establish the timing of the allegedly material, public misstatement made into an allegedly efficient market (as well as when the fraud ended due to entry of truth on the market) before the fraud-on-the-market theory can be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3).  Thus, the lower court opinion in Basic expressly identified \xe2\x80\x9cthe time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed\xe2\x80\x9d as part of fraud on the market.  Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750 (CA6 1986).  The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v.

Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and truth is established at certification, there is no framework within which to determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common question.  Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a factor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n.\xc2\xa08, I agree.  It would be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3) and (4).  It is equally important to establish the timing range at certification for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes.  This fact undercuts the majority\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to isolate materiality as the only factor of fraud on the market that need not be shown at certification to demonstrate that reliance is a common question.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that respondent meets the prerequisites of Fed.

The Court dismisses this concern, ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320, attempting to give fraud-on-the-market analysis the imprimatur of congressional enactment instead of recognizing it as a judicially created doctrine grafted onto an implied cause of action.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it will be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that later determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the certitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is correct.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">10</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Ampex\xe2\x80\x99s sales for 1971 were just under $284 million.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United States Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it was invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1988)\n.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s Court applies to that rule the principles of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and thereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is established at the certification stage even when material-ity has not been shown.  That would be a correct procedure if Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the question of substantive liability\xe2\x80\x94what must be shown in order to prevail.  If that were so, the new substantive rule, like the more general substantive rule that reliance must be proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to the commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3).  In my view, however, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x94a well functioning market plus purchase or sale in the market plus material misrepresentation known to the market establishes a necessary showing of reliance\xe2\x80\x94governs not only the question of substantive liability, but also the question whether certification is proper.  All of the elements of that rule, including materiality, must be established if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.  The answer to the question before us today is to be found not in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBasic established a presumption that the misrepresen-tation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the plaintiffs relied on the market price.  And it established that presumption not just for the question of substantive liability but also for the question of certification.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe granted certiorari .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to determine whether the courts below properly applied a presumption of reliance in certifying the class, rather than requiring each class member to show direct reliance on Basic\xe2\x80\x99s statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 230 (emphasis added).  Of course it makes no sense to \xe2\x80\x9cpresume reliance\xe2\x80\x9d on the misrepresentation merely because the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the alleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the market price\xe2\x80\x94that is, unless it was material.  Thus, as Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot through with references to the necessary materiality.  The presumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither substantive liability will attach nor will certification be proper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of materiality for certification is demonstrated by the last sentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court has decided to remand the case for reconsideration of materiality under the appropriate legal standard: \xe2\x80\x9cThe District Court\xe2\x80\x99s certification of the class here was appropriate when made but is subject on remand to such adjustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 250.  Those circumstances are the establishment of facts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that show the misrepresentation was not material, or was not known to the market.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to certification on a fraud-on-the-market theory, the Basic Court would not have approved the class certification order while remanding for reconsideration of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the plaintiffs had mustered sufficient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for avoiding summary judg-ment.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  The Court manufactures an inconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern class certification at the time of Basic.  We recently clarified that \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).  But review of the Basic certification order shows that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he allegations of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint are sufficient to bring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the so-called \xe2\x80\x98fraud on the market\xe2\x80\x99 theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86\xe2\x80\x93279,  p.\xc2\xa0115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint paragraphs as establishing fraud on the market).  Under a pleadings standard, the District Court found that the plaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud on the market, including its materiality predicate.  See id., at 133a (denial of reconsideration) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis court ruled on December 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance] could be established by the following: proof of a material misrepresentation which affected the market price of the stocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Thus, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded materiality that the certification order \xe2\x80\x9cwas appropriate when made,\xe2\x80\x9d Basic, supra, at 250, the defendants retained an opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to defeat certification.*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCertification of the class is often, if not usually, the prelude to a substantial settlement by the defendant because the costs and risks of litigating further are so high.
