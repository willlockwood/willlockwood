The District Court held that both statutes waived federal sovereign immunity from punitive fines, by both their federal-facilities and citizensuit sections.

Both the CWA and RCRA contain various provisions expressly defining "person" for purposes of the entire section in which the term occurs, thereby raising the inference that a special definition not described as being for purposes of its "section" or "subchapter" was intended to have the more limited application to its own clause or sentence. This textual analysis gives effect to all the language of the citizen-suit sections, since their incorporations of their statutes\' civilpenalties sections will effectively authorize punitive fines where a polluter other than the United States is brought to court, while their explicit authorizations for suits against the United States concededly authorize coercive sanctions.

Ohio\'s first argument, that \xc2\xa7 1323(a)\'s use of the word "sanction" must be understood to encompass punitive fines, is mistaken, as the term\'s meaning is spacious enough to cover coercive as well as punitive fines. Moreover, good reason to infer that Congress was using "sanction" in its coercive sense, to the exclusion of punitive fines, lies in the fact that \xc2\xa7 1323(a) twice speaks of "sanctions" in conjunction with judicial "process," which is characteristically "enforced" through forward-looking coercive measures, and distinguishes "process and sanctions" from substantive "requirements," which may be enforced either by coercive or punitive means.

The proviso\'s second modifier makes it plain that "civil penalties" must at least include a coercive penalty since they are exemplified by penalties "imposed by a State ... court to enforce [its] order." Moreover, the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="609">609</a></p><p>contention that the proviso\'s "arising under federal law" modifier is broad enough to include penalties prescribed by EPA-approved state statutes supplanting the CWA is answered by this Court\'s interpretation of the phrase "arising under" federal law in 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331 to exclude cases in which the plaintiff relies on state law, even when the State\'s exercise of power in the particular circumstances is expressly permitted by federal law, see, <i>e. g., Gully </i>v. <i>First Nat. Bank in Meridian, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a>, 116, and by the probability that Congress adopted the same interpretation of "arising under federal law" here, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>ICC </i>v. <i>Locomotive Engineers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/270/case.html">482 U. S. 270</a>, 284-285. The plain language of the "civil penalties arising under federal law" phrase suggests an apparently expansive, but uncertain, waiver that is in tension with the clear waiver for coercive fines evinced in \xc2\xa7 1323(a)\'s antecedent text; that tension is resolved by the requirement that any statement of waiver be unequivocal and the rule that waivers be narrowly construed. Pp. 623-627.</p><p>(e) RCRA\'s federal-facilities section-which, in relevant part, subjects the Government to "all ... State ... requirements, both substantive and procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief)," and provides that the United States "shall [not] be immune ... from any process or sanction of any ... Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief"-is most reasonably interpreted as including substantive standards and the coercive means for implementing those standards, but excluding punitive measures. All of the textual indications of the kinds of requirements meant to bind the Government refer either to mechanisms requiring review for substantive compliance (permit and reporting requirements) or to mechanisms for enforcing substantive compliance in the future (injunctive relief and sanctions to enforce it), in stark contrast to the statute\'s failure to mention any mechanism for penalizing past violations. Moreover, the fact that the only specific reference to an enforcement mechanism in the provision\'s final sentence describes "sanction" as a coercive means of injunctive enforcement bars any inference that a waiver of immunity from "requirements" somehow extends to punitive fines that are never so much as mentioned.

A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part, holding that Congress had waived immunity from punitive fines in the CWNs federalfacilities section and RCRNs citizen-suit section, but not in RCRNs federal-facilities section. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/904/1058/">904 F.2d 1058</a> (1990).6 Judge Guy dissented, concluding that neither the CWNs federal-facilities section nor RCRNs citizen-suit section sufficed to provide the waiver at issue. <i>Id., </i>at 1065-1069.</p><p>In No. 90-1341, DOE petitioned for review insofar as the Sixth Circuit found any waiver of immunity from punitive fines, while in No. 90-1517, Ohio cross-petitioned on the holding that RCRNs federal-facilities section failed to effect such a waiver.7 We consolidated the two petitions and granted certiorari, 500 U. S. 951 (1991).8</p><p>6 The court held that its ruling on the CW A\'s federal-facilities section obviated any need to consider that statute\'s citizen-suit section. 904 F. 2d, at 1062.</p><p>7 Ohio\'s petition also asked that if we reversed the lower court\'s conclusion on the CWA\'s federal-facilities section, we consider whether that statute\'s citizen-suit section contained a waiver, an issue the Sixth Circuit declined to reach.</p><p>8The Sixth Circuit\'s holding that the CWA\'s federal-facilities section waives federal sovereign immunity from punitive fines conflicts with the Ninth Circuit\'s conclusion that that section does not constitute such a waiver. See <i>California </i>v. <i>Department of Navy, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/845/222/">845 F.2d 222</a> (1988).

It is undisputed that each civil-penalties provision authorizes fines of the punitive sort.</p><p>The effect of incorporating each statute\'s civil-penalties section into its respective citizen-suit section is not, however, as clear as Ohio claims. The incorporations must be read as encompassing all the terms of the penalty provisions, including their limitations, see, <i>e. g., Engel </i>v. <i>Davenport, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/271/33/case.html">271 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 6903(15) (defining "person" for purposes of RCRA as "an individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body").</p><p>12 A subsection of RCRA dealing with a federal demonstration program tracking the disposal of medical waste does in fact require that "each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States" "be treated as" a "person." See Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988, \xc2\xa7 2(a), Pub. L. 100-582, 102 Stat. 2955, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6992e(b). This broader provision,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="618">618</a></p><p>seen as a pointed one when so many other governmental entities are specified, see 2A Singer, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 47.23, a fact that renders the civil-penalties sections inapplicable to the United States.</p><p>Against this reasoning, Ohio argues that the incorporated penalty provisions\' exclusion of the United States is overridden by the National Government\'s express inclusion as a "person" by each of the citizen-suit sections. There is, of course, a plausibility to the argument. Whether that plausibility suffices for the clarity required to waive sovereign immunity is, nonetheless, an issue we need not decide, for the force of Ohio\'s argument wanes when we look beyond the citizen-suit sections to the full texts of the respective statutes.</p><p>What we find elsewhere in each statute are various provisions specially defining "person" and doing so expressly for purposes of the entire section in which the term occurs. Thus, for example, "[f]or the purpose of this [CWA] section," 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1321(a)(7) defines "person" in such a way as to exclude the various governmental entities included in the general definition of "person" in 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1362(5).13 Again, "[f]or the purpose of this section," \xc2\xa7 1322(a)(8) defines "person" so as to exclude "an individual on board a public vessel" as well as the governmental entities falling within the general definition. Similarly in RCRA, "[f]or the purpose of ... subchapter [IX]" the general definition of "person" is expanded to include "the United States Government," among other entities. 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6991(6). Within each statute, then, there is a contrast between drafting that merely redefines "person" when it occurs within a particular clause or sentence and drafting that expressly alters the definition for any and all purposes of the entire section in</p><p>however, applies only "[f]or purposes of this Act," <i>ibid., </i>which refers to the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 itself, see 102 Stat. 2950.</p><p>13 See n. 11, <i>supra.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="619">619</a></p><p>which the special definition occurs.14 Such differences in treatment within a given statutory text are reasonably understood to reflect differences in meaning intended, see 2A Singer, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 46.06, and the inference can only be that a special definition not described as being for purposes of the "section" or "subchapter" in which it occurs was intended to have the more limited application to its own clause or sentence alone. Thus, in the instances before us here, the inclusion of the United States as a "person" must go to the clauses subjecting the United States to suit, but no further.</p><p>This textual analysis passes the test of giving effect to all the language of the citizen-suit sections. Those sections\' incorporations of their respective statutes\' civil-penalties sections will have the effect of authorizing punitive fines when a polluter other than the United States is brought to court by a citizen, while the sections\' explicit authorizations for suits against the United States will likewise be effective, since those sections concededly authorize coercive sanctions against the National Government.15</p><p>A clear and unequivocal waiver of anything more cannot be found; a broader waiver may not be inferred, see <i>Ruckels-</i></p><p>14 The dissent fails to appreciate this difference, arguing that \xc2\xa7 1365(a) "states that any person, as used in that subdivision, includes the United States," <i>post, </i>at 633. That statement is simply incorrect; the citizen-suit section does no more than include the United States in the class of entities that may be the subject of a suit brought under this section. In stark contrast to the examples we have given, see n. 12, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 1365(a) does not purport to apply the more expansive definition of "person" throughout the subsection; by its terms it speaks only to the first mention of "person."</p><p>15 DOE explicitly concedes that such relief is available against the United States in the context of citizen suits pursuant to the CWA, see Brief for Petitioner DOE 33, and implicitly so concedes with regard to RCRA, see <i>id., </i>at 40-41.

C. \xc2\xa7 1323(a).</p></blockquote><p>Ohio rests its argument for waiver as to punitive fines on two propositions: first, that the statute\'s use of the word "sanction" must be understood to encompass such fines, see Brief for Respondent Ohio 26-29; and, second, with respect to the fines authorized under a state permit program approved by EPA, that they "aris[e] under Federal law" despite their genesis in state statutes, and are thus within the scope of the "civil penalties" covered by the congressional waiver, <i>id., </i>at 29-35.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="621">621</a></p><p>Ohio\'s first proposition is mistaken. As a general matter, the meaning of "sanction" is spacious enough to cover not only what we have called punitive fines, but coercive ones as well, and use of the term carries no necessary implication that a reference to punitive fines is intended. One of the two dictionaries Ohio itself cites reflects this breadth. See Black\'s Law Dictionary 1341 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "sanction" as a "[p]enalty or other mechanism of enforcement used to provide incentives for obedience with the law or with rules and regulations. That part of a law which is designed to secure enforcement by imposing a penalty for its violation or offering a reward for its observance"). Ohio\'s other such source explicitly adopts the coercive sense of the term. See Ballentine\'s Law Dictionary 1137 (3d ed. 1969) (defining sanction in part as "[a] coercive measure").</p><p>Beyond the dictionaries, examples of usage in the coercive sense abound. See, <i>e. g., Penfield Co. of Cal. </i>v. <i>SEC, 330 </i>U. S. 585, 590 (1947) (fines and imprisonment imposed as "coercive sanctions" when imposed to compel target "to do what the law made it his duty to do"); <i>Hicks </i>v. <i>Feiock, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/624/case.html">485 U.

Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2023(b)(4) (West Supp. 1992) (authorizing, in response to litigant\'s failure to obey discovery order, "terminating sanction[s]," including "contempt sanction[s]" and orders staying further proceedings by recalcitrant litigant). Cf. 42 U. S.

Thus, resort to a "sanction" carries no necessary implication of the punitive as against the coercive.</p><p>The term\'s context, of course, may supply a clarity that the term lacks in isolation, see, <i>e. g., Shell Oil Co. </i>v. <i>Iowa Dept. of Revenue, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/19/case.html">488 U. S. 19</a>, 26 (1988). It tends to do so here, but once again the clarity so found cuts against Ohio\'s position. The word "sanction" appears twice in \xc2\xa7 1323(a), each time within the phrase "process and sanction[s]." The first sentence subjects Government agencies to "process and sanctions," while the second explains that the Government\'s corresponding liability extends to "any process and sanction, whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts or in any other manner."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="623">623</a></p><p>Three features of this context are significant. The first is the separate statutory recognition of three manifestations of governmental power to which the United States is subjected: substantive and procedural requirements; administrative authority; and "process and sanctions," whether "enforced" in courts or otherwise. Substantive requirements are thus distinguished from judicial process, even though each might require the same conduct, as when a statute requires and a court orders a polluter to refrain from discharging without a permit. The second noteworthy feature is the conjunction of "sanction[sJ" not with the substantive "requirements," but with "process," in each of the two instances in which "sanction" appears. "Process" normally refers to the procedure and mechanics of adjudication and the enforcement of decrees or orders that the adjudicatory process finally provides. The third feature to note is the statute\'s reference to "process and sanctions" as "enforced" in courts or otherwise. Whereas we commonly understand that "requirements" may be enforced either by backward-looking penalties for past violations or by the "process" of forward-looking orders enjoining future violations, such forward-looking orders themselves are characteristically given teeth by equity\'s traditional coercive sanctions for contempt: fines and bodily commitment imposed pending compliance or agreement to comply. The very fact, then, that the text speaks of sanctions in the context of enforcing "process" as distinct from substantive "requirements" is a good reason to infer that Congress was using "sanction" in its coercive sense, to the exclusion of punitive fines.</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>The last relevant passage of \xc2\xa7 1323(a), which provides that "the United States shall be liable only for those civil penalties arising under Federal law or imposed by a State or local court to enforce an order or the process of such court," is not to the contrary. While this proviso is unlike the preceding</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="624">624</a></p><p>text in that it speaks of "civil penalties," not "sanctions," it is obviously phrased to clarify or limit the waiver preceding it. Here our concern is with its clarifying function (leaving its limiting effect until later), and it must be said that as a clarifier the proviso speaks with an uncertain voice. To be sure, the second modifier of "civil penalties" at least makes it plain that the term (like "sanction," to which it relates) must include a coercive penalty, since "civil penalties" are exemplified by those "imposed by a State or local court to enforce an order or the process of such court." To this extent, then, the proviso serves to confirm the reading we reached above.</p><p>The role of the first modifier is problematical, however.</p><p>On the one hand, it tugs toward a more expansive reading of "civil penalties." If by using the phrase "civil penalties arising under Federal law" Congress meant nothing more than coercive fines arising under federal law, it would have been simpler to describe all such penalties as imposed to enforce an order or process, whether of a local, state, or federal court. Thus, the first modifier suggests that the civil penalties arising under federal law may indeed include the punitive along with the coercive. Nevertheless, a reading expansive enough to reflect a waiver as to punitive fines would raise a new and troublesome question about the source of legal authority to impose such a fine. As far as federal law is concerned, the only available source of authority to impose punitive fines is the civil-penalties section, \xc2\xa7 1319(d). But, as we have already seen, that section does not authorize liability against the United States, since it applies only against "persons," from whom the United States is excluded.</p><p>Ohio urges us to find a source of authority good against the United States by reading "arising under Federal law" to include penalties prescribed by state statutes approved by EPA and supplanting the CWA. Ohio argues for treating a state statute as providing penalties "arising under Federal law" by stressing the complementary relationship between</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="625">625</a></p><p>the relevant state and federal statutes and the role of such state statutes in accomplishing the purpose of the CW A. This purpose, as Ohio states it, is "to encourage compliance with comprehensive, federally approved water pollution programs while shielding federal agencies from unauthorized penalties." Brief for Respondent Ohio 34-35. Ohio asserts that "federal facility compliance ... cannot be ... accomplished without the [punitive] penalty deterrent." <i>Id., </i>at 35.</p><p>The case for such pessimism is not, however, self-evident.</p><p>To be sure, an agency of the Government may break the law where it might have complied voluntarily if it had faced the prospect of punitive fines for past violations. But to say that its "compliance cannot be ... accomplished" without such fines is to assume that without sanctions for past conduct a federal polluter can never be brought into future compliance, that an agency of the National Government would defy an injunction backed by coercive fines and even a threat of personal commitment. The position seems also to ignore the fact that once such fines start running they can be every dollar as onerous as their punitive counterparts; it could be a very expensive mistake to plan on ignoring the law indefinitely on the assumption that contumacy would be cheap.</p><p>Nor does the complementary relationship between state and federal law support Ohio\'s claim that state-law fines thereby "arise under Federal law." Plain language aside, the far more compelling interpretative case rests on the best known statutory use of the phrase "arising under federal law," appearing in the grant of federal-question jurisdiction to the courts of the United States. See 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331. There, we have read the phrase "arising under" federal law to exclude cases in which the plaintiff relies on state law, even when the State\'s exercise of power in the particular circumstances is expressly permitted by federal law. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Gully </i>v. <i>First Nat. Bank in Meridian, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a>, 116 (1936) (suit over state taxation of nationally chartered bank does not arise under federal law even though such taxa-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="626">626</a></p><p>tion would not be possible without federal approval); <i>International Bridge Co. </i>v. <i>New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/126/case.html">254 U. S. 126</a>, 133 (1920) (congressional approval of construction of bridge by statechartered company does not make federal law the source of right to build bridge ).16 Congress\' use of the same language in \xc2\xa7 1323(a) indicates a likely adoption of our prior interpretation of that language. See, <i>e. g., ICC </i>v. <i>Locomotive Engineers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/270/case.html">482 U. S. 270</a>, 284-285 (1987) (interpreting statute based on previous interpretation of same language in another statute); <i>Northcross </i>v. <i>Memphis Bd. of Education, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/427/case.html">412 U. S. 427</a>, 428 (1973) <i>(per curiam) </i>(similarity of language in two statutes "strong indication that [they] should be interpreted <i>pari passu"). </i>The probability is enough to answer Ohio\'s argument that "arising under Federal law" in \xc2\xa7 1323(a) is broad enough to cover provisions of state statutes approved by a federal agency but nevertheless applicable <i>ex </i>proprw v~gore.</p><p>Since Ohio\'s argument for treating state-penalty provisions as arising under federal law thus fails, our reading of the last-quoted sentence from \xc2\xa7 1323(a) leaves us with an unanswered question and an unresolved tension between closely related statutory provisions. The question is still what Congress could have meant in using a seemingly expansive phrase like "civil penalties arising under Federal law." Perhaps it used it just in case some later amendment might waive the Government\'s immunity from punitive sanctions. Perhaps a drafter mistakenly thought that liability for such sanctions had somehow been waived already. Perhaps</p><p>16 Of course, the phrase "arising under" federal law appears in Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution, where it has received a broader construction than in its statutory counterpart. See <i>Verlinden B. V. </i>v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/case.html">461 U. S. 480</a>, 494-495 (1983). Ohio, however, has offered no reason to believe Congress intended this broader reading rather than the narrower statutory reading. Even assuming an equal likelihood for each intent, our rule requiring a narrow construction of waiver language tips the balance in favor of the narrow reading.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="627">627</a></p><p>someone was careless. The question has no satisfactory answer.</p><p>We do, however, have a response satisfactory for sovereign immunity purposes to the tension between a proviso suggesting an apparently expansive but uncertain waiver and its antecedent text that evinces a narrower waiver with greater clarity. For under our rules that tension is resolved by the requirement that any statement of waiver be unequivocal: as against the clear waiver for coercive fines the indication of a waiver as to those that are punitive is less certain. The rule of narrow construction therefore takes the waiver no further than the coercive variety.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>We consider, finally, the federal-facilities section of RCRA, which provides, in relevant part, that the National Government</p><blockquote><p>\n"shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief) ... in the same manner, and to the same extent, as any person is subject to such requirements .... Neither the United States, nor any agent, employee, or officer thereof, shall be immune or exempt from any process or sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief." 42 U.

Department of Air Force, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/903/1293/">903 F.2d 1293</a>, 1295 (1990).</p><p>We have already observed that substantive requirements can be enforced either punitively or coercively, and the Tenth Circuit\'s understanding that Congress intended the latter finds strong support in the textual indications of the kinds of requirements meant to bind the Government. Significantly, all of them refer either to mechanisms requiring review for substantive compliance (permit and reporting requirements) or to mechanisms for enforcing substantive compliance in the future (injunctive relief and sanctions to enforce it). In stark contrast, the statute makes no mention of any mechanism for penalizing past violations, and this absence of any example of punitive fines is powerful evidence that Congress had no intent to subject the United States to an enforcement mechanism that could deplete the federal fisc regardless of a responsible officer\'s willingness and capacity to comply in the future.</p><p>The drafters\' silence on the subject of punitive sanctions becomes virtually audible after one reads the provision\'s final sentence, waiving immunity "from any process or sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief." The fact that the drafters\' only specific reference to an enforcement mechanism described "sanction" as a coercive means of injunctive enforcement bars any inference that a waiver of immunity from "requirements" somehow unquestionably extends to punitive fines that are never so much as mentionedP</p><p>17We also reject Ohio\'s argument purporting to rest on <i>Hancock </i>v.</p><p><i>Train, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/167/case.html">426 U. S. 167</a> (1976). In <i>Hancock </i>we determined that, as then written, \xc2\xa7 118 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1857f (1970 ed.), did not require federal facilities to obtain state pollution permits as a condition of continued operation. The relevant portion of \xc2\xa7 1857 required the National Government to "comply with Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements respecting control ... of air pollution." Ohio and its <i>amici </i>stress the point in our analysis where we found it significant that \xc2\xa7 1857 did not require federal compliance with <i>"all </i>federal, state, interstate, and local</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="629">629</a></p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE STEVENS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>These cases concern a uranium-processing plant which, the Government concedes, has "contaminated the soil, air and surface waters" of Fernald, Ohio, with radioactive materials, "exceeded certain of the effluent limitations set forth" in its water pollution permit, and "failed to construct portions of the water pollution control facilities in accordance" with the permit.

See 426 U. S., at 182 (emphasis in original). They read our opinion as drawing a distinction between substantive and procedural requirements, and as interpreting \xc2\xa7 1857 as not waiving federal immunity from procedural requirements, the group in which we classified the state permit programs. Ohio and its <i>amici </i>conclude that the drafters of RCRA took our observations in <i>Hancock </i>to heart, and, seeking to waive federal sovereign immunity for all purposes, including liability for civil punitive fines, waived immunity for "all ... requirements, both substantive and procedural." 42 U.

Indications of the breadth of the Government\'s obligation to comply with substantive or procedural requirements dealt with in <i>Hancock </i>do not necessarily translate into indications that the Government\'s subjection to mechanisms for enforcing those obligations extends to punitive as well as to coercive sanctions. In any event, if Congress had in fact entertained the intention Ohio suggests, it would hardly have avoided any example of punitive fines at the same time as it expressly mentioned the coercive injunctive remedy.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="630">630</a></p><p>Opinion of WHITE, J.</p><p>up or contain the contamination at its facilities.1 Federal facilities fail to comply with the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1323(a), see <i>ante, </i>at 620, both establishes the Government\'s duty to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of the CWA and explicitly waives immunity for civil penalties. The first part of the federal facilities provision states that the Federal Government is subject to "any process and sanction," regardless of the court in which it is enforced.</p><p>The majority devotes three pages of its opinion to a tortured discussion of whether subjecting the Government to "process and sanction" encompasses liability for civil penalties. See <i>ante, </i>at 621-623. Rather than engaging in these analytic gymnastics, the Court needed to do nothing more than read the rest of the federal facilities provision. It clearly states:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]he United States shall be liable only for those civil penalties arising under Federal law or imposed by a State or local court to enforce an order or the process of such court." 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1323(a).</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, Congress intended the United States to be liable for civil penalties. The plain language of the statute says so. Therefore, the broad term "sanctions" used earlier in the same subsection must include these penalties. Any other reading would contravene the "ancient and sound rule of construction that each word in a statute should, if possible, be given effect." <i>Crandon </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/152/case.html">494 U.

The waiver here unambiguously reached those claims for civil penalties "arising</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="632">632</a></p><p>Opinion of WHITE, J.</p><p>under" federal law. The critical inquiry is under what circumstances civil penalties arise under federal law.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Ohio contends that it is entitled to recover civil penalties on two different claims: the first brought under the CW A itself, through its citizen suit provision, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1365(a), and the second under the Ohio water pollution laws that arise under the CW Ns distinctive mechanism allowing States to administer CW A enforcement within their own boundaries. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 6111.09 (Supp. 1987). I agree that the waiver of immunity covers both types of claims.</p><p align="center">\n1</p><p>First, the CWA waives sovereign immunity for civil penalty claims brought under the Act\'s citizen suit clause. 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1365(a). See <i>ante, </i>at 615-616. That section unambiguously provides authority to sue "any person (including ... the United States ... )" and to recover "any appropriate civil penalties" under the civil penalties clause of the CWA enforcement provision, \xc2\xa7 1319(d). It is impossible to fathom a clearer statement that the United States may be sued and found liable for civil penalties. The enforcement provision lists those violations that may be subject to a civil penalty, sets a ceiling on the size of the penalty, and lists factors that the court should consider in determining the amount of a penalty. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Nevertheless, the majority concludes that this straightforward approach is not sufficient to waive immunity. The Court latches onto the fact that the enforcement provision does not include its own definition of "person" and that the CW Ns general purpose definition of the word "person" does not include the United States. \xc2\xa7 1362(5).4 Again, there is a</p><p>4 Section 1362(5) states: "The term \'person\' means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="633">633</a></p><p>short answer to this claim. The statute says, in plain English, that its general definitions apply "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided." \xc2\xa7 1362. The citizen suit provision is one of the exceptions to the general rule; it states that any person, as used in that subdivision, includes the United States. \xc2\xa7 1365(a). Certainly this special definition applies to the civil penalty enforcement provisions it incorporates.</p><p>To conclude otherwise is to resort to "ingenuity to create ambiguity" that simply does not exist in this statute. <i>Rothschild </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/179/463/case.html">179 U. S. 463</a>, 465 (1900).</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>The CWA also waives immunity for civil penalties arising under state laws enacted to allow local administration of the CW A permit program. The majority rejects this proposition by relying on cases in which the Court has held that state laws approved by the Federal Government do not "arise under" federal law. See <i>ante, </i>at 625-626. But these cases are inapposite because the CW A regime goes far beyond simple federal approval of state action. Instead, the Act establishes a distinctive variety of cooperative federalism.</p><p>As we recently explained: "The Clean Water Act anticipates a partnership between the States and the Federal Government .... " <i>Arkansas </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, ante, </i>at 10l. To effectuate this partnership, the CW A authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue pollution discharge permits, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1342, but provides that a State may "administer" its own permit system if it complies with detailed statutory and regulatory requirements. 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b); 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 123.1-123.64 (1991). A State that seeks to "administer" a permitting program is required to adopt a system of civil penalties. 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b)(7). Federal regulations establish the minimum size of the penalties and mandate how, and when, they must be imposed. 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 123.27(a)(3)(i), 123.27(b)(1), 123.27(c) (1991).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="634">634</a></p><p>Opinion of WHITE, J.</p><p>Even when a State obtains approval to administer its permitting system, the Federal Government maintains an extraordinary level of involvement. EPA reviews state water quality standards. 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1313(c). It retains authority to object to the issuance of particular permits, \xc2\xa7 1342(d)(2), to monitor the state program for continuing compliance with federal directives, \xc2\xa7 1342(c), and even to enforce the terms of state permits when the State has not instituted enforcement proceedings, \xc2\xa7 1319(a).</p><p>Under this unusual statutory structure, compliance with a state-administered permit is deemed compliance with the CWA. \xc2\xa7 1342(k). Indeed, in <i>EPA </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i>decided together with <i>Arkansas </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i>the EPA asserted that "the showing necessary to determine under the CW A whether there is compliance with any particular state [pollution] standard is itself <i>a matter of federal, not state, </i>law." Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1991, No. 90-1266, p. 18, n. 21 (emphasis added). Cf. <i>Arkansas </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, ante, </i>at 110 (recognizing the "federal character" of state pollution standards in interstate pollution controversy). This conclusion is not surprising, since the citizen suit provision of the CW A authorizes any citizen to sue under federal law for a "violation of ... an order issued by ... a State with respect to [any effluent] standard or limitation .... " 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1365(a).</p><p>Given the structure of the CWA, it is apparent that the "arising under" limitation on the waiver of sovereign immunity was not intended to protect the Federal Government from exposure to penalties under state laws that merely provide for the administration of a CW A permit system. Instead, the limitation shields the Government from liability under state laws that have not been subject to initial EPA review and ongoing agency supervision.5 Only by resorting</p><p>5 States may adopt more rigorous water quality standards than those established under the CWA. EPA regulations provide that a State is not precluded from:</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="635">635</a></p><p>to "an unduly restrictive interpretation" of the CWA and focusing on the "arising under" language in isolation can the majority reach a contrary result. <i>Canadian Aviator, 324 </i>U. S., at 222.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Because of its determination to find that civil penalties are not available against the Government, the majority paints itself into a corner. The Court acknowledges that its distortion of the statute leaves the phrase "civil penalties arising under Federal law" devoid of meaning. See <i>ante, </i>at 626627. But rather than reading the CWA as Congress wrote it and recognizing that it effects a waiver of immunity, the majority engages in speculation about why Congress could not have meant what it unambiguously said:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Perhaps it used [civil penalties arising under federal law] just in case some later amendment might waive the Government\'s immunity from punitive sanctions. Perhaps a drafter mistakenly thought that liability for such sanctions had somehow been waived already. Perhaps someone was careless." <i>Ibid.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is one thing to insist on an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity. It is quite another "to impute to Congress a desire for incoherence" as a basis for rejecting an explicit waiver. <i>Keifer </i>&amp; <i>Keifer </i>v. <i>Reconstruction Finance Corporation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/381/case.html">306 U.

"Surely the interest in requiring the Congress</p><p>"(1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part;</p><p>"(2) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 6961. See <i>ante, </i>at 627-628. The section makes no reference to civil penalties and, instead, waives immunity for "any such injunctive relief." This language comports with the Government\'s claim that the waiver is intended to reach only coercive and not punitive sanctions. The provision certainly does not unequivocally encompass civil penalties. Therefore, I join Part II-C of the Court\'s opinion.</p><p>However, I would find a waiver under RCRA\'s citizen suit provision, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6972(a), see <i>ante, </i>at 616, which is very similar to the citizen suit provision in the CW A, for the reasons I have explained above.
