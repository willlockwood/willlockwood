Ryan, \n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___, this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State\xe2\x80\x99s] initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona, where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim during his first state collateral review proceeding.  Ibid.  This case regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on collateral review.  Rather, Texas law appears to permit a prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner to do so.  The question presented in this case is whether, despite this difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a life sentence.  Neither new counsel appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state collateral review raised the claim that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances.  When that claim was finally raised in Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition, the District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in state court.  The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted because of Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise it in his initial state postconviction proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this failure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the federal courts from considering the claim.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s good-cause exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must initially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to permit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Where, as here, a State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception recognized in Martinez applies.

Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722\n,729\xe2\x80\x93730.  However, a \xe2\x80\x9cprisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez, supra, at ___.  In Martinez, the Court recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s statement \xe2\x80\x9cthat an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  That exception allows a federal habeas court to find \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse such default where (1) the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d claim; (2) the \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of there being \xe2\x80\x9cno counsel\xe2\x80\x9d or only \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d counsel during the state collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceeding was the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial\xe2\x80\x9d review proceeding in respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim\xe2\x80\x9d; and (4) state law requires that the claim \xe2\x80\x9cbe raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___.

Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(1)\xc2\xa0This conclusion is supported by two characteristics of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 procedures.  First, Texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to be presented on direct review.  The nature of an ineffective-assistance claim means that the trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim.  And a motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate because of Texas rules regarding time limits on the filing, and the disposal, of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts.  Thus, a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts necessary for evaluating these claims in Texas.  Second, were Martinez not to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant unfairness because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on collateral, rath- er than on direct, review.  Texas can point to only a few cases in which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to expand the record on appeal.  Texas suggests that there are other mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal, but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application, and cannot overcome the Texas courts\xe2\x80\x99 own well-supported determination that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  Respondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here, where appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to bring a substantial ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the procedural default, but respondent points to no case in which such a failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for applying that exception here.  The right involved\xe2\x80\x94adequate assistance of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x94is similarly and critically important.  In both instances practical considerations\xe2\x80\x94the need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim\xe2\x80\x94argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral, not on direct, review.  See Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  In both instances failure to consider a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cineffectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d during an initial-review collateral proceeding as a potential \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d for excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  See id., at ___.  Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a State that grants permission but denies a fair, meaningful opportunity to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.

Ryan, \n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2012)\n, we considered the right of a state prisoner to raise, in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  In that case an Arizona procedural rule required a defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during his first state collateral review proceeding\xe2\x80\x94or lose the claim.  The defendant in Martinez did not comply with the state procedural rule.  But he argued that the federal habeas court should excuse his state procedural failing, on the ground that he had good \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d for not raising the claim at the right time, namely that, not only had he lacked effective counsel during trial, but also he lacked effective counsel during his first state collateral review proceeding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe held that lack of counsel on collateral review might excuse defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state law procedural default.  We wrote:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State\xe2\x80\x99s] initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time we qualified our holding.  We said that the holding applied where state procedural law said that \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case Texas state law does not say \xe2\x80\x9cmust.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not on its face require a defendant initially to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a state col- lateral review proceeding.  Rather, that law appears at first glance to permit (but not require) the defendant initially to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.  The structure and design of the Texas system in actual operation, however, make it \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually impossible\xe2\x80\x9d for an ineffective assistance claim to be presented on direct review.  See Robinson v. State, 16 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 808, 810\xe2\x80\x93811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  We must now decide whether the Martinez exception applies in this procedural regime.  We conclude that it does.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA Texas state court jury convicted petitioner, Carlos Trevino, of capital murder.  After a subsequent penalty-phase hearing, the jury found that Trevino \xe2\x80\x9cwould commit criminal acts of violence in the future which would constitute a continuing threat to society,\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cactually caused the death of Linda Salinas or, if he did not actually cause her death, he intended to kill her or another, or he anticipated a human life would be taken,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere were insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d rather than death.  449 Fed. Appx. 415, 418 (CA5 2011).  The judge consequently imposed a sentence of death.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEight days later the judge appointed new counsel to handle Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal.  App. 1, 3.  Seven months after sentencing, when the trial transcript first became available, that counsel filed an appeal.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then considered and rejected Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s appellate claims.  Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s appellate counsel did not claim that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial court proceedings.  Id., at 12\xe2\x80\x9324.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAbout six months after sentencing, the trial judge appointed Trevino a different new counsel to seek state collateral relief.  As Texas\xe2\x80\x99 procedural rules provide, that third counsel initiated collateral proceedings while Tre- vino\xe2\x80\x99s appeal still was in progress.  This new counsel first sought postconviction relief (through collateral review) in the trial court itself.  After a hearing, the trial court denied relief; and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that denial.  Id., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326, 321\xe2\x80\x93349.  Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction claims included a claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the penalty phase of Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial, but it did not include a claim that trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness consisted in part of a failure adequately to investigate and to present mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase of Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Id., at 321\xe2\x80\x93349; see Wiggins v. Smith, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510, \n523 (2003)\n (counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate and present mitigating circumstances deprived defendant of effective assistance of counsel).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTrevino then filed a petition in federal court seeking a writ of habeas corpus.  The Federal District Court appointed another new counsel to represent him.  And that counsel claimed for the first time that Trevino had not received constitutionally effective counsel during the penalty phase of his trial in part because of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase.  App. 438, 456\xe2\x80\x93478.  Federal habeas counsel pointed out that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel had presented only one witness at the sentencing phase, namely Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s aunt.  The aunt had testified that Trevino had had a difficult upbringing, that his mother had an alcohol problem, that his family was on welfare, and that he had dropped out of high school.  She had added that Trevino had a child, that he was good with children, and that he was not violent.  Id., at 285\xe2\x80\x93291.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederal habeas counsel then told the federal court that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel should have found and presented at the penalty phase other mitigating matters that his own investigation had brought to light.  These included, among other things, that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s mother abused alcohol while she was pregnant with Trevino, that Trevino weighed only four pounds at birth, that throughout his life Trevino suffered the deleterious effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, that as a child Trevino had suffered numerous head injuries without receiving adequate medical attention, that Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s mother had abused him physically and emotionally, that from an early age Trevino was exposed to, and abused, alcohol and drugs, that Trevino had attended school irregularly and performed poorly, and that Tre- vino\xe2\x80\x99s cognitive abilities were impaired.  Id., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal court stayed proceedings to permit Trevino to raise this claim in state court.  The state court held that because Trevino had not raised this claim during his initial postconviction proceedings, he had procedurally defaulted the claim, id., at 27\xe2\x80\x9328; and the Federal District Court then denied Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, id., at 78\xe2\x80\x9379.  The District Court concluded in relevant part that, despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9ceven the most minimal investigation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would have revealed a wealth of additional mitigating evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d an independent and adequate state ground (namely Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise the issue during his state postconviction proceeding) barred the federal habeas court from considering the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  Id., at 131\xe2\x80\x93132.  See Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722\n\xe2\x80\x93730 (1991).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTrevino appealed.  The Fifth Circuit, without considering the merits of Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, agreed with the District Court that an independent, adequate state ground, namely Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default, barred its consideration.  449 Fed. Appx., at 426.  Although the Circuit decided Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s case before this Court decided Martinez, the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in a later case, Ibarra v. Thaler, 687 F.\xc2\xa03d 222 (2012), makes clear that the Fifth Circuit would have found that Martinez would have made no difference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is because in Ibarra the Circuit recognized that Martinez had said that its good-cause exception applies where state law says that a criminal defendant must initially raise his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in initial state collateral review proceedings.  687 F. 3d, at 225\xe2\x80\x93226.  Texas law, the Circuit pointed out, does not say explicitly that the defendant must initially raise the claim in state collateral review proceedings.  Rather Texas law on its face appears to permit a criminal defendant to raise such a claim on direct appeal.  Id., at 227.  And the Circuit held that that fact means that Martinez does not apply in Texas.  687 F. 3d, at 227.  Since the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding in Ibarra (that Martinez does not apply in Texas) would similarly govern this case, we granted certiorari here to determine whether Martinez applies in Texas.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with Martinez.  We there recognized the historic importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as a method for preventing individuals from being held in custody in violation of federal law.  Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  See generally Preiser v. Rodriguez, \n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 475\n\xe2\x80\x93485 (1973).  In general, if a convicted state criminal defendant can show a federal habeas court that his conviction rests upon a violation of the Federal Constitution, he may well obtain a writ of habeas corpus that requires a new trial, a new sentence, or release.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe similarly recognized the importance of federal ha- beas corpus principles designed to prevent federal courts from interfering with a State\xe2\x80\x99s application of its own firmly established, consistently followed, constitutionally proper procedural rules.  Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  Those principles have long made clear that a conviction that rests upon a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state law \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural default\xe2\x80\x9d (for example, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise a claim of error at the time or in the place that state law requires), normally rests upon \xe2\x80\x9can independent and adequate state ground.\xe2\x80\x9d  Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93730.  And where a conviction rests upon such a ground, a fed- eral habeas court normally cannot consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional claim.  Ibid.; see Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, we pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is not without exceptions.  A prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  And we turned to the issue directly before the Court: whether Martinez had shown \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse his state procedural failing.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMartinez argued that his lawyer should have raised, but did not raise, his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collateral review proceedings.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  He added that this failure, itself amounting to ineffective assistance, was the \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d of, and ought to excuse, his procedural default.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  But this Court had previously held that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]egligence on the part of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction attorney does not qualify as \xe2\x80\x98cause,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d primarily because a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d such as the prisoner, \xe2\x80\x9cbears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent,\xe2\x80\x9d the attorney.  Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Coleman, supra, at 753\xe2\x80\x93754; emphasis added).  Martinez, in effect, argued for an exception to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s broad statement of the law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe ultimately held that a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d should \xe2\x80\x9cmodify the unqualified statement in Coleman that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a proce- dural default.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  We did so for three reasons.  First, the \xe2\x80\x9cright to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Indeed, the right to counsel is the foundation for our adversary system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appellate review could amount to \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d excusing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise (and thus procedurally defaulting) a constitutional claim.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  But States often have good reasons for initially reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collateral proceedings rather than on direct appellate review.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).  That is because review of such a claim normally requires a different attorney, because it often \xe2\x80\x9cdepend[s] on evidence outside the trial record,\xe2\x80\x9d and because efforts to expand the record on direct appeal may run afoul of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bbreviated deadlines,\xe2\x80\x9d depriving the new attorney of \xe2\x80\x9cadequate time .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to investigate the ineffective-assistance claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, where the State consequently channels initial review of this constitutional claim to collateral proceedings, a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim during initial-review collateral proceedings, could (were Coleman read broadly) deprive a defendant of any review of that claim at all.  Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe consequently read Coleman as containing an exception, allowing a federal habeas court to find \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby excusing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default, where (1) the claim of \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x9d was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d claim; (2) the \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of there being \xe2\x80\x9cno counsel\xe2\x80\x9d or only \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d counsel during the state collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceeding was the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial\xe2\x80\x9d review proceeding in respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim\xe2\x80\x9d; and (4) state law requires that an \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of trial counsel [claim] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11, 15).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere state law differs from that in Martinez in respect to the fourth requirement.  Unlike Arizona, Texas does not expressly require the defendant to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in an initial collateral review proceeding.  Rather Texas law on its face appears to permit (but not require) the defendant to raise the claim on direct appeal.  Does this difference matter?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo characteristics of the relevant Texas procedures lead us to conclude that it should not make a difference in respect to the application of Martinez.  First, Texas procedure makes it \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually impossible for appellate counsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance [of trial counsel] claim\xe2\x80\x9d on direct review.  Robinson, 16 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 810\xe2\x80\x93811.  As the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals itself has pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe inherent nature of most ineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d of trial counsel \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d means that the trial court record will often fail to \xe2\x80\x9ccontai[n] the information necessary to substantiate\xe2\x80\x9d the claim.  Ex\xc2\xa0parte Torres, 943 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 469, 475 (1997) (en banc).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court of Criminal Appeals has also noted, a convicted defendant may make a motion in the trial court for a new trial in order to develop the record on appeal.  See Reyes v. State, 849 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 812, 816 (1993).  And, in principle, the trial court could, in connection with that motion, allow the defendant some additional time to de- velop a further record.  Ibid.  But that motion-for-new-trial \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle is often inadequate because of time constraints and because the trial record has generally not been transcribed at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d  Torres, supra, at 475.  See Tex. Rule App. Proc. 21.4 (2013) (motion for a new trial must be made within 30 days of sentencing); Rules 21.8(a), (c) (trial court must dispose of motion within 75 days of sentencing); Rules 35.2(b), 35.3(c) (transcript must be prepared within 120 days of sentencing where a motion for a new trial is filed and this deadline may be extended).  Thus, as the Court of Criminal Appeals has concluded, in Texas \xe2\x80\x9ca writ of habeas corpus\xe2\x80\x9d issued in state collateral proceedings ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cis essential to gathering the facts necessary to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. evaluate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The present capital case illustrates why it does not.  The trial court appointed new counsel for Trevino eight days after sentencing.  Counsel thus had 22 days to decide whether, and on what grounds, to make a motion for a new trial.  She then may have had an additional 45 days to provide support for the motion but without the help of a transcript (which did not become available until much later\xe2\x80\x94seven months after the trial).  It would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, within that time frame to investigate Trevino\xe2\x80\x99s background, de- termine whether trial counsel had adequately done so, and then develop evidence about additional mitigating background circumstances.  See Reyes, supra, at 816 (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]otions for new trial [must] be supported by affidavit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. specifically showing the truth of the grounds of attack\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, were Martinez not to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant unfairness.  That is because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on collateral, rather than on direct, review.  As noted, they have explained why direct review proceedings are likely inadequate.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  They have held that failure to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the defendant from raising the claim in collateral proceedings.  See, e.g., Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at 813; Ex\xc2\xa0parte Duffy, 607 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 507, 512\xe2\x80\x93513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (overruled on other grounds by Hernandez v. State, 988 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 770 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)).  They have held that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the defendant from also raising the claim in collateral proceedings.  See, e.g., Lopez v. State, 343 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 137, 143 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Torres, supra, at 475.  They have suggested that appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise the claim on direct review does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Sprouse v. State, No. AP\xe2\x80\x9374933, 2007 WL 283152, *7 (Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 31, 2007) (unpublished).  And Texas\xe2\x80\x99 highest criminal court has explicitly stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general rule\xe2\x80\x9d the de- fendant \xe2\x80\x9cshould not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather in collateral re- view proceedings.  Mata v. State, 226 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 425, 430, n.\xc2\xa014 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See Rob- inson, supra, at 810 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] post-conviction writ proceeding, rather than a motion for new trial, is the preferred method for gathering the facts necessary to substantiate\xe2\x80\x9d an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe criminal bar, not surprisingly, has taken this strong judicial advice seriously.

Texas now can point to only a comparatively small number of cases in which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to expand the record on appeal and then received a hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal.  Brief for Respondent 35\xe2\x80\x9336, and n. 6 (citing, inter alia, State v. Morales, 253 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 686, 689\xe2\x80\x93691 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Robertson v. State, 187 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 475, 480\xe2\x80\x93481 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).  And, of those, precisely one case involves trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s investigative failures of the kind at issue here.  See Armstrong v. State, No. AP\xe2\x80\x9375706, 2010 WL 359020 (Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 27, 2010) (unpublished).  How could federal law deny defendants the benefit of Martinez solely because of the existence of a theoretically available pro- cedural alternative, namely direct appellate review, that Texas procedures render so difficult, and in the typical case all but impossible, to use successfully, and which Texas courts so strongly discourage defendants from using?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent argues that Texas courts enforce the relevant time limits more flexibly than we have suggested.  Sometimes, for example, an appellate court can abate an appeal and remand the case for further record development in the trial court.  See Cooks v. State, 240 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 906 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).  But the procedural possibilities to which Texas now points seem special, limited in their application, and, as far as we can tell, rarely used.  See 43A Texas Practice \xc2\xa750:15, at 636\xe2\x80\x93639; 43B id., \xc2\xa756:235, at 607\xe2\x80\x93609.  Cooks, for example, the case upon which respondent principally relies, involved a remand for further record development, but in circumstances where the lower court wrongly failed to give a defendant new counsel in time to make an ordinary new trial motion.  240 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 911.  We do not believe that this, or other, special, rarely used procedural possibilities can overcome the Texas courts\xe2\x80\x99 own well-supported determination that collateral review normally constitutes the preferred\xe2\x80\x94and indeed as a practical matter, the only\xe2\x80\x94method for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent further argues that there is no equitable problem to be solved in Texas because if counsel fails to bring a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel may constitute cause to excuse the procedural default.  See Murray v. Carrier, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478 (1986)\n.  But respondent points to no case in which such a failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective.  And that lack of authority is not surprising given the fact that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has directed defendants to bring such claims on collateral review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons just stated, we believe that the Texas procedural system\xe2\x80\x94as a matter of its structure, design, and operation\xe2\x80\x94does not offer most defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.  What the Arizona law prohibited by explicit terms, Texas law precludes as a matter of course.  And, that being so, we can find no significant difference between this case and Martinez.  The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for the application of that exception here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe right involved\xe2\x80\x94adequate assistance of counsel at trial\xe2\x80\x94is similarly and critically important.  In both instances practical considerations, such as the need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim, argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral, rather than on direct, review.  See Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); see also Massaro v. United States, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500, \n505 (2003)\n.  In both instances failure to consider a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cineffectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d during an initial-review collateral proceeding as a potential \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d for excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity at all for review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  See Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a State that in theory grants permission but, as a matter of procedural design and systemic operation, denies a meaningful opportunity to do so is a distinction without a difference.  In saying this, we do not (any more than we did in Martinez) seek to encourage States to tailor direct appeals so that they provide a fuller op- portunity to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims.  That is a matter for the States to decide.

We recognized in Coleman that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here a [habeas] petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 754.  But we simultaneously recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In that situation, we held, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the petitioner who must bear the burden of a failure to follow state proce-dural rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Because the error in Coleman occurred during state postconviction proceedings, a point at which the habeas petitioner had no constitutional right to counsel, the petitioner had to bear the cost of his default.

In Martinez, Arizona law did not allow defendants to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal; they could only raise such claims in state collateral proceedings.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  We held that while Arizona was free to structure its state court procedures in this way, its \xe2\x80\x9cdecision is not without consequences for the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assert a procedural default in later proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy deliberately choosing to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State significantly diminishes prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 ability to file such claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the context of this state procedural framework,\xe2\x80\x9d attorney error would qualify as cause to excuse procedural default if it occurred in the first proceeding at which the prisoner was \xe2\x80\x9callow[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to raise his trial ineffectiveness claim.

It was instead an important part of our explanation for why \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests protected by stare decisis principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The fact that the exception was clearly delineated ensured that the Coleman rule would remain administrable.  And because States could readily anticipate how such a sharply defined exception would apply to various procedural frameworks, the exception could be reconciled with our concerns for comity and equitable balancing that led to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s baseline rule in the first place.  See Coleman, supra, at 750\xe2\x80\x93751.  The States had a clear choice, which they could make with full knowledge of the consequences: If a State \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately cho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process\xe2\x80\x9d through a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to bar defendants from raising\xe2\x80\x9d them there, then\xe2\x80\x94and only then\xe2\x80\x94would \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness in an initial-review collateral proceeding qualif[y] as cause for a procedural default.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday, with hardly a mention of these concerns, the majority throws over the crisp limit we made so explicit just last Term.  We announced in Martinez that the exception applies \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the State barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  But today, the Court takes all the starch out of its rule with an assortment of adjectives, adverbs, and modifying clauses: Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d now applies whenever the \xe2\x80\x9cstate procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to raise his claim on direct appeal.  Ante, at 14.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe questions raised by this equitable equation are as endless as will be the state-by-state litigation it takes to work them out.  We are not told, for example, how meaningful is meaningful enough, how meaningful-ness is to be measured, how unlikely highly unlikely is, how often a procedural framework\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coperation\xe2\x80\x9d must be reassessed, or what case qualifies as the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d case.  Take just this last example: The case before us involved a jury trial (hardly typical), a capital conviction (even less typical), and\xe2\x80\x94as the majority emphasizes\xe2\x80\x94a particular species of ineffectiveness claim that depends on time-consuming investigation of personal background and other mitigating circumstances.  Ante, at 10.  Yet the majority holds it up, apparently, as a case that is typical in the relevant sense, saying that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he present capital case illustrates\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d working of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s procedural framework.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven that the standard is so opaque and malleable, the majority cannot describe the exception applied here as narrow, and does not do so.  Gone are the repeated words of limitation that characterized the Martinez opinion.  Gone too is the clear choice that Martinez gave the States about how to structure their criminal justice systems.  Now, the majority offers them a gamble: If a State allows defendants to bring ineffectiveness claims both on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, then a prisoner might have to comply with state procedural requirements in order to preserve the availability of federal habeas review, if a federal judge decides that the state system gave the defendant (or enough other \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d defendants) a sufficiently meaningful opportunity to press his claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis invitation to litigation will, in precisely the manner that Coleman foreclosed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98frustrate both the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 748 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107, \n128 (1982)\n).  In what I suspect (though cannot know) will be a broad swath of cases, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach will excuse procedural defaults that, under Coleman, should preclude federal review.  But even in cases where federal courts ultimately decide that the habeas petitioner cannot establish cause under the new standard, the years of procedural wrangling it takes to reach that decision will themselves undermine the finality of sentences necessary to effective criminal justice.  Because that approach is inconsistent with Coleman, Martinez itself, and the principles of equitable discretion and comity at the heart of both, I respectfully dissent. \n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970664">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x9310189\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS TREVINO, PETITIONER v.
