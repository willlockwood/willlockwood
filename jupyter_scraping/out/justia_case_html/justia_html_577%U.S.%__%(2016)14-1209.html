Under ANILCA, those lands were placed into \xe2\x80\x9cconservation system units,\xe2\x80\x9d which were defined to include \xe2\x80\x9cany unit in Alaska of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, or a National Forest Monument.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U. S. C. \xc2\xa73102(4).  In addition to federal land, over 18 million acres of state, Native Corporation, and private land were also included within the boundaries of those conservation system units.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2007, John Sturgeon was piloting his hovercraft over a stretch of the Nation River that flows through the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, a conservation system unit in Alaska that is managed by the National Park Service.  Alaska law permits the use of hovercraft.  National Park Service regulations do not.  See 36 CFR \xc2\xa72.17(e).  Park Service rangers approached Sturgeon, informing him that hovercraft were prohibited within the preserve under Park Service regulations.  Sturgeon protested that Park Service regulations did not apply because the river was owned by the State of Alaska.  The rangers ordered Sturgeon to remove his hovercraft from the preserve, and he complied.  Sturgeon later filed suit against the Park Service in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief permitting him to operate his hovercraft within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley.  Alaska intervened in support of Sturgeon.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Secretary of the Interior has authority to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations\xe2\x80\x9d concerning \xe2\x80\x9cboating and other activities on or relating to water located within System units.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n54 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7100751(b).  The Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s hovercraft regulation was adopted pursuant to Section 100751(b).  The hovercraft ban is not limited to Alaska, but instead has effect in federally managed preservation areas across the country.  Section 103(c) of ANILCA, in contrast, addresses the scope of the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s authority over lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska.  The first sentence of Section 103(c) specifies the property included as a portion of those units.  It states: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73103(c).   ANILCA defines the word \xe2\x80\x9cland\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9clands, waters, and interests therein,\xe2\x80\x9d and the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic lands\xe2\x80\x9d to include lands to which the United States has \xe2\x80\x9ctitle,\xe2\x80\x9d with certain exceptions.  \xc2\xa73102.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The second sentence of Section 103(c) concerns the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands in Alaska, which include state, Native Corporation, and private property.  It provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo lands which, before, on, or after December 2, 1980, are conveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73103(c).  The third sentence of Section 103(c) explains how new lands become part of conservation system units: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the State, a Native Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall become part of the unit, and be administered accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Interpreting Section 103(c) of ANILCA, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Park Service, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in pertinent part.  According to the Ninth Circuit, because the hovercraft regulation \xe2\x80\x9capplies to all federal-owned lands and waters administered by [the Park Service] nationwide, as well as all navigable waters lying within national parks,\xe2\x80\x9d the hovercraft ban does not apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d within conservation system units in Alaska.  768 F.\xc2\xa03d 1066, 1077.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Park Service therefore has authority to enforce its hovercraft regulation on the Nation River.  The Ninth Circuit did not address whether the Nation River counts as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ANILCA.    </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Section 103(c) is inconsistent with both the text and context of ANILCA.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Section 103(c) violates \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Roberts </i>v. <i>Sea-Land Services, Inc</i>., 566 U. S. ___, ___.  ANILCA repeatedly recognizes that Alaska is different, and ANILCA itself accordingly carves out numerous Alaska-specific exceptions to the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s general authority over federally managed preservation areas.  Those Alaska-specific provisions reflect the simple truth that Alaska is often the exception, not the rule.  Yet the reading below would prevent the Park Service from recognizing Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s unique conditions.  Under that reading, the Park Service could regulate \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands in Alaska only through rules applicable outside Alaska as well.  The Court concludes that, whatever the reach of the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s authority under ANILCA, Section 103(c) did not adopt such a \xe2\x80\x9ctopsy-turvy\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Moreover, it is clear that Section 103(c) draws a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska.  And yet, according to the court below, if the Park Service wanted to differentiate between that \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land in an Alaska-specific way, it would have to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land pursuant to rules applicable outside Alaska, and the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land pursuant to Alaska-specific provisions.  Assuming the Park Service has authority over \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land in Alaska (an issue the Court does not decide), the Court concludes that this is an implausible reading of the statute.  The Court therefore rejects the interpretation of Section 103(c) adopted by the court below.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Court does not reach the remainder of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments.  In particular, it does not decide whether the Nation River qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ANILCA.  It also does not decide whether the Park Service has authority under Section 100751(b) to regulate Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s activities on the Nation River, even if the river is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land, or whether\xe2\x80\x94as Sturgeon argues\xe2\x80\x94any such authority is limited by ANILCA.  Finally, the Court does not consider whether the Park Service has authority under ANILCA over both \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska, to the extent a regulation is written to apply specifically to both types of land.  The Court leaves those arguments to the lower courts for consideration as necessary.

Because parts of the river are shallow and difficult to navigate, Sturgeon travels by hovercraft, an amphibious vehicle capable of gliding over land and water.  To reach his preferred hunting grounds, Sturgeon must pilot his hovercraft over a stretch of the Nation River that flows through the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, a 1.7 million acre federal preservation area managed by the National Park Service.\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7410hh(10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Alaska law permits the use of hovercraft.

After Park Service rangers informed Sturgeon that he was prohibited from using his hovercraft within the boundaries of the preserve, Sturgeon filed suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  He argues that the Nation River is owned by the State, and that the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) prohibits the Park Service from enforcing its regulations on state-owned land in Alaska.  The Park Service disagrees, contending that it has authority to regulate waters flowing through federally managed preservation areas.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Park Service.  We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 1867, Secretary of State William Seward, serving under President Andrew Johnson, negotiated a treaty to purchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million.

In a single stroke, the United States gained 365 million acres of land\xe2\x80\x94an area more than twice the size of Texas.

As word of their discovery spread, thousands traveled to Alaska to try their hand at mining.  Once the gold rush subsided, settlers turned to other types of mining, fishing, and trapping, fueling an emerging export economy.  See Naske &amp; Slotnick 128\xe2\x80\x93129, 155, 249\xe2\x80\x93251; D. Wharton, The Alaska Gold Rush 186\xe2\x80\x93187 (1972).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite newfound recognition of Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s economic potential, however, it was not until the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s that Congress seriously considered admitting Alaska as a State.  By that time, it was clear that Alaska was strategically important both in the Pacific and Arctic, and that the Territory was rich in natural resources, including oil.  Moreover, the people of Alaska favored statehood.  See Naske &amp; Slotnick 201, 224\xe2\x80\x93235.  But there was a problem: Out of the 365 million acres of land in Alaska, 98 percent were owned by the Federal Government.  As a result, absent a land grant from the Federal Government to the State, there would be little land available to drive private economic activity and contribute to the state tax base.  See S. Rep. No. 1163, at 2, 12 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe expenses of the State of Alaska will be comparatively high, partially due to the vast land areas within the State; but the State would be able to realize revenues from only 2 percent of this vast area unless some provision were made to modify the present land-ownership conditions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A solution was struck.  The 1958 Alaska Statehood Act permitted Alaska to select 103 million acres of \xe2\x80\x9cvacant, unappropriated, and unreserved\xe2\x80\x9d federal land\xe2\x80\x94just over a quarter of all land in Alaska\xe2\x80\x94for state ownership.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b),\n\n72Stat.\n340.

When Congress failed to approve the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s selections, however, President Carter unilaterally designated 56 million acres of federal land in Alaska as national monuments.

Sturgeon was headed to a hunting ground upstream from the preserve, just shy of the Canadian border.  To reach that hunting ground, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cmoose meadows,\xe2\x80\x9d Sturgeon had to travel on a portion of the river that flows through the preserve.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">About two miles into his trip on the Nation River, Sturgeon stopped on a gravel bar to repair the steering cable of his hovercraft.

Despite Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s protests that Park Service regulations did not apply because the river was owned by the State of Alaska, the rangers ordered Sturgeon to remove his hovercraft from the preserve.  Sturgeon complied, heading home without a moose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sturgeon now fears that he will be criminally prosecuted if he returns to hunt along the Nation River in his hovercraft.

Sturgeon, the Park Service, and the Ninth Circuit each adopt a different reading of Section 103(c), reaching different conclusions about the scope of the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s powers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sturgeon, joined by the State, understands Section 103(c) to stand for a simple proposition: The Park Service is prohibited from regulating \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land in Alaska as if that land were owned by the Federal Government.  He contends that his reading is consistent with the history of federal land management in Alaska, beginning with the Alaska Statehood Act and culminating in ANILCA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s argument proceeds in two steps.  First, he asserts that the Nation River is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ANILCA and is therefore not part of the Yukon-Charley.  As discussed, ANILCA defines \xe2\x80\x9cpublic lands\xe2\x80\x9d as lands to which the United States has \xe2\x80\x9ctitle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73102.  And Section 103(c) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73103(c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sturgeon argues that the Nation River is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land\xe2\x80\x9d because it is owned by the State and not by the Federal Government.  To support his argument, Sturgeon relies on the Alaska Statehood Act, which granted ownership of the submerged lands beneath the navigable waters in Alaska, and the resources within those waters, to the State.  See \xc2\xa76(m),\n\n72Stat.\n343;\n\n43 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71311(a).  He also cites this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32 (1978)\n, which stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Submerged Lands Act transferred title to and ownership of the submerged lands and waters\xe2\x80\x9d to the States.  <i>Id.</i>, at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the State and not the Federal Government owns the Nation River, Sturgeon urges, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land under ANILCA and is therefore not part of the Yukon-Charley.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Sturgeon asserts that because the Nation River is not part of the Yukon-Charley, the Park Service lacks authority to regulate it.  His argument rests on the second sentence of Section 103(c), which states that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o lands which, before, on, or after December 2, 1980, are conveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73103(c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sturgeon argues that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units\xe2\x80\x9d refers to those regulations that apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d by virtue of the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to manage national parks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 18, 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The word \xe2\x80\x9csolely,\xe2\x80\x9d Sturgeon contends, simply ensures that \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of those units remain subject to laws generally \xe2\x80\x9capplicable to both public and private lands (such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 19.  Because the hovercraft regulation was adopted pursuant to the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s authority over federally managed preservation areas, and is not a law of general applicability like the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, Sturgeon concludes that Section 103(c) bars enforcement of the regulation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Park Service, in contrast, reads Section 103(c) more narrowly.  In its brief in this Court, the Park Service, while defending the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, relies primarily on very different arguments.  The agency stresses that it has longstanding authority to regulate waters within federally managed preservation areas, and that Section 103(c) does not take any of that authority away.  In reaching its conclusion, the Park Service disagrees with Sturgeon at each step.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Park Service contends that the Nation River is part of the Yukon-Charley.  To support that contention, the agency cites ANILCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic lands,\xe2\x80\x9d which\xe2\x80\x94as noted\xe2\x80\x94includes \xe2\x80\x9clands, waters, and interests therein\xe2\x80\x9d to which the United States has \xe2\x80\x9ctitle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73102.  The Park Service argues that the United States has \xe2\x80\x9ctitle\xe2\x80\x9d to an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>in the water within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley under the reserved water rights doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The reserved water rights doctrine specifies that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Federal Government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the Government, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then unappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cappaert</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128,\n138 (1976)\n.  By creating the Yukon-Charley, the Park Service urges, the Federal Government reserved the water within the boundaries of the conservation system unit to achieve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s conservation goals.  As a result, the Federal Government has \xe2\x80\x9ctitle\xe2\x80\x9d to an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d in the Nation River, making it \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land subject to Park Service regulations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Park Service contends that even if the Nation River is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land, the agency still has authority to regulate it.  According to the Park Service, the second sentence of Section 103(c) imposes only a limited restriction on the agency\xe2\x80\x99s power, prohibiting it from enforcing on \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands only those regulations that explicitly apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely to public lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  The hovercraft regulation applies both within \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he boundaries of feder-ally owned lands and waters administered by the National Park Service\xe2\x80\x9d <i>and </i>to \xe2\x80\x9c[w]aters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States located within the boundaries of the National Park System, including navigable waters .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without regard to the ownership of submerged lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  36 CFR \xc2\xa71.2(a).  Accordingly, the Park Service asserts, the hovercraft regulation does not apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely to public lands,\xe2\x80\x9d and Section 103(c) therefore does not prevent enforcement of the regulation.  See Brief for Respondents 56\xe2\x80\x9358.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit, for its part, adopted a reading of Section 103(c) different from the primary argument advanced by the Park Service in this Court.  The Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the Nation River counts as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land for purposes of ANILCA.  Instead, it held that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units\xe2\x80\x9d distinguishes between Park Service regulations that apply solely to \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d lands <i>in Alaska</i>, and Park Service regulations that apply to federally managed preservation areas across the country.  In the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Park Service may enforce nationally applicable regulations on both \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d property within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska, because such regulations do not apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely to public lands within such units.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Park Service may not, however, apply Alaska-specific regulations to \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of those units.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the Ninth Circuit, because the hovercraft regulation \xe2\x80\x9capplies to all federal-owned lands and waters administered by [the Park Service] nationwide, as well as all navigable waters lying within national parks,\xe2\x80\x9d the hovercraft ban does not apply \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d within conservation system units in Alaska.  768 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1077.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Park Service therefore has authority to enforce its hovercraft regulation on the Nation River.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1078.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding is subject to some interpretation, but Sturgeon, the State, the Alaska Native Corporations, and the Park Service (at least at times) concur in our understanding of the decision below.  See Brief for Petitioner 25; Brief for State of Alaska as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23; Brief for Arctic Slope Regional Corporation et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12\xe2\x80\x9313;<i> </i>Brief for Doyon, Ltd., et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>31\xe2\x80\x9332; Brief for Respondents 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 61; 80 Fed. Reg. 65573 (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We reject the interpretation of Section 103(c) adopted by the Ninth Circuit.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units\xe2\x80\x9d may be plausible in the abstract, but it is ultimately inconsistent with both the text and context of the statute as a whole.  Statutory language \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be construed in a vacuum.  It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>Sea-Land Services, Inc.</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the reading of the statute adopted below, the Park Service may apply nationally applicable regulations to \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska, but it may not<i> </i>apply Alaska-specific regulations to those lands.  That is a surprising conclusion.  ANILCA repeatedly recognizes that Alaska is different\xe2\x80\x94from its \xe2\x80\x9cunrivaled scenic and geological values,\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d situation of its \xe2\x80\x9crural residents dependent on subsistence uses,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for development and use of Arctic resources with appropriate recognition and consideration given to the unique nature of the Arctic environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73101(b), 3111(2), 3147(b)(5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">ANILCA itself accordingly carves out numerous Alaska-specific exceptions to the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s general authority over federally managed preservation areas.  For example, ANILCA requires the Secretary of the Interior to permit \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of valid commercial fishing rights or privi-leges\xe2\x80\x9d within the National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska, including the use of \xe2\x80\x9ccampsites, cabins, motorized vehicles, and aircraft landings directly incident to the exercise of such rights or privileges,\xe2\x80\x9d with certain exceptions.\n\n94Stat.\n2393.  ANILCA also requires the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cpermit on the public lands appropriate use for subsistence purposes of snowmobiles, motorboats, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed for such purposes by local residents, subject to reasonable regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73121(b).  And it provides that National Preserves \xe2\x80\x9cin Alaska shall be administered and managed as a unit of the National Park System in the same manner as a national park <i>except</i> as otherwise provided in this Act and <i>except </i>that the taking of fish and wildlife for sport purposes and subsistence uses, and trapping shall be allowed\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to applicable law.  \xc2\xa73201 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many similar examples are woven throughout ANILCA.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>\n\n94Stat.\n2393 (Secretary must administer wildlife refuge \xe2\x80\x9cso as to not impede the passage of navigation and access by boat on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to reasonable regulation); <i>id.</i>, at 2388 (Secretary must allow reindeer grazing uses in certain areas, including construction of necessary facilities);\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73203(a) (Alaska-specific rules for wilderness management apply \xe2\x80\x9cin recognition of the unique conditions in Alaska\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa73170(a) (Secretary must permit reasonable use of snowmachines, motorboats, and airplanes within conserva-tion system units \xe2\x80\x9cfor travel to and from villages and homesites\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All those Alaska-specific provisions reflect the simple truth that Alaska is often the exception, not the rule.  Yet the reading below would prevent the Park Service from recognizing Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s unique conditions.  Under that reading, the Park Service could regulate \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands in Alaska only through rules applicable <i>outside </i>Alaska as well.  Thus, for example, if the Park Service elected to allow hovercraft during hunting season in Alaska\xe2\x80\x94in a departure from its nationwide rule\xe2\x80\x94the more relaxed regulation would apply only to the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land within the boundaries of the unit.  Hovercraft would still be banned from the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land, even during hunting season.  Whatever the reach of the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s authority under ANILCA, we cannot conclude that Section 103(c) adopted such a topsy-turvy approach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, it is clear that Section 103(c) draws a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska.  See \xc2\xa73103(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (No lands \xe2\x80\x9cconveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units\xe2\x80\x9d).  And yet, according to the court below, if the Park Service wanted to differentiate between that \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land in an Alaska-specific way, it would have to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land pursuant to rules applicable outside Alaska, and the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land pursuant to Alaska-specific provisions.  Assuming the Park Service has authority over \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d land in Alaska (an issue we do not decide), that strikes us as an implausible reading of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Looking at ANILCA both as a whole and with respect to Section 103(c), the Act contemplates the possibility that all the land within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska may be treated differently from federally managed preservation areas across the country, and that \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of those units may be treated differently from \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the unit.  Under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Section 103(c), however, the former is not an option, and the latter would require contorted and counterintuitive measures.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore reject the interpretation of Section 103(c) adopted by the court below.  That reading of the statute was the sole basis for the disposition of this case by the Court of Appeals.  We accordingly vacate the judgment of that court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not reach the remainder of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments.  In particular, we do not decide whether the Nation River qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ANILCA.  Sturgeon claims that it does not; the Park Service that it does.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments in this respect touch on vital issues of state sovereignty, on the one hand, and federal authority, on the other.  We find that in this case those issues should be addressed by the lower courts in the first instance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given this determination, we also do not decide whether the Park Service has authority under Section 100751(b) to regulate Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s activities on the Nation River, even if the river is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d land, or whether\xe2\x80\x94as Sturgeon argues\xe2\x80\x94any such authority is limited by ANILCA.  Fin-ally, we do not consider the Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s alternative ar-gument that it has authority under ANILCA over both \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-public\xe2\x80\x9d lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska, to the extent a regulation is written to apply specifically to both types of land.  We leave those arguments to the lower courts for consideration as necessary.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</i></div><i>\n</i></div><i>\n</i>\n</div>'
