COSTA CROCIERE S.&amp;NBSP;P.&amp;NBSP;A.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">KRUPSKI <em>v</em>. COSTA CROCIERE S.\xc2\xa0p. A.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93337.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 21, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 7, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a cruise ship.  Her passenger ticket, which was issued by Costa Cruise Lines, identified respondent Costa Crociere S.\xc2\xa0p.\xc2\xa0A. as the carrier; required an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written notice of a claim; required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of the injury; and designated a specific Federal District Court as the exclusive forum for lawsuits such as Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s.  The front of the ticket listed Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s Florida address and made references to \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruises.\xe2\x80\x9d  After Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s attorney notified Costa Cruise of her claims but did not reach a settlement, Krupski filed a diversity negligence action against Costa Cruise.  Over the next several months\xe2\x80\x94after the limitations period had expired\xe2\x80\x94Costa Cruise brought Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s existence to Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s attention three times, including in its motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant.  Krupski responded and moved to amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant.  The District Court denied Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend.  After she served Costa Crociere with an amended complaint, the court dismissed Costa Cruise from the case.  Thereafter, Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x94represented by the same counsel as Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x94moved to dismiss, contending that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which governs when an amended pleading \xe2\x80\x9crelates back\xe2\x80\x9d to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limitations period.  The Rule requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that within the Rule 4(m) 120-day period for service after a complaint is filed, the newly named defendant \xe2\x80\x9cknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).  The District Court found this condition fatal to Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to relate back.  It concluded that she had not made a mistake about the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity because, although Costa Cruise had disclosed Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s role in several court filings, she nonetheless delayed for months filing an amended complaint.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s identity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended.  It was therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one potential party over another.  Additionally, the court held that relation back was not appropriate because of Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s undue delay in seeking to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Rule\xe2\x80\x99s text does not support the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision to rely on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge in denying relation back.  The question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or should have known Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s identity as the proper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known during the Rule 4(m) period that it would have been named as the defendant but for an error.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s information is relevant only if it bears on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  It would be error to conflate knowledge of a party\xe2\x80\x99s existence with the absence of mistake.  That a plaintiff knows of a party\xe2\x80\x99s existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  Making a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be the antithesis of making a mistake, but that does not mean that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake.  A plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied.  This reading is consistent with relation back\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of  balancing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interests protected by the statute of limitations with the preference of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits.  It is also consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  And it is not foreclosed by <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>Adams USA, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/460/index.html">529 U. S. 460</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit also erred in ruling that Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s undue delay in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended complaint justified its denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  The Rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation back, and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s diligence is not among them.  Moreover, it mandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied; it does not leave that decision to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable discretion.  Its mandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry under Rule 15(a), which gives a district court discretion to decide whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial.  See <em>Foman</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/178/index.html">371 U. S. 178</a>, 182.  Rule 15(c)(1)(C) permits a court to examine a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but only to the extent the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling conduct informs the prospective defendant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the relation-back question.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Under these principles, the courts below erred in denying relation back.  Because the original complaint (of which Costa Crociere had constructive notice) made clear that Krupski meant to sue the company that \xe2\x80\x9cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\xe2\x80\x9d the ship on which she was injured and also indicated (mistakenly) that Costa Cruise performed those roles, Costa Crociere should have known that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because of Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstanding about which \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x9d entity was in charge of the ship\xe2\x80\x94clearly a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  That Krupski may have known the ticket\xe2\x80\x99s contents does not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the two companies\xe2\x80\x99 identities.  Especially because the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that it was entitled to think she made no mistake is not persuasive.  Moreover, respondent has articulated no strategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.  Nothing in Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a mistake.  The interrelationship between Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere and their similar names heighten the expectation that Costa Crociere should suspect a mistake when Costa Cruise is named in a complaint actually describing Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  In addition, Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper party\xe2\x80\x9d: The front of the ticket advertises that \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruises\xe2\x80\x9d has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying which \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x9d company is meant.  And as shown in similar lawsuits, Costa Crociere is evidently well aware that the difference between it and Costa Cruise can be confusing for passengers.

Where an amended pleading changes a party or a party\xe2\x80\x99s name, the Rule requires, among other things, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party to be brought in by amendment \xe2\x80\xa6 knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  In this case, the Court of Appeals held that Rule 15(c) was not satisfied because the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper defendant before filing her original complaint.  The court also held that relation back was not appropriate because the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend.  We hold that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 21, 2007, petitioner, Wanda Krupski, tripped over a cable and fractured her femur while she was on board the cruise ship Costa Magica.

The ticket further required any lawsuit to be \xe2\x80\x9cfiled within one year after the date of injury\xe2\x80\x9d and to be \xe2\x80\x9cserved upon the carrier within 120 days after filing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  For cases arising from voyages departing from or returning to a United States port in which the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the ticket designated the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Broward County, Florida, as the exclusive forum for a lawsuit.  <em>Id.,</em> at 36a.  The ticket extended the \xe2\x80\x9cdefenses, limitations and exceptions \xe2\x80\xa6 that may be invoked by the CARRIER\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9call persons who may act on behalf of the CARRIER or on whose behalf the CARRIER may act,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cthe CARRIER\xe2\x80\x99s parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, representatives, agents, employees, servants, concessionaires and contractors\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruise Lines N.

The front of the ticket listed Costa Cruise Lines\xe2\x80\x99 address in Florida and stated that an entity called \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruises\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe first cruise company in the world\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain a certain certification of quality.  <em>Id.,</em> at 25a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 2, 2007, Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s counsel notified Costa Cruise Lines of Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  App. 69\xe2\x80\x9370.  On July 9, 2007, the claims administrator for Costa Cruise requested additional information from Krupski \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n order to facilitate our future attempts to achieve a pre-litigation settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\xe2\x80\x9324a.  The parties were unable to reach a settlement, however, and on February 1, 2008\xe2\x80\x94three weeks before the 1-year limitations period expired\xe2\x80\x94Krupski filed a negligence action against Costa Cruise, invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  The complaint alleged that Costa Cruise \xe2\x80\x9cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\xe2\x80\x9d the ship on which Krupski had injured herself; that Costa Cruise had extended to its passengers an invitation to enter onto the ship; and that Costa Cruise owed Krupski a duty of care, which it breached by failing to take steps that would have prevented her accident.  App. 23\xe2\x80\x9326.  The complaint further stated that venue was proper under the passenger ticket\xe2\x80\x99s forum selection clause and averred that, by the July 2007 notice of her claims, Krupski had complied with the ticket\xe2\x80\x99s presuit requirements.  <em>Id.,</em> at 23.  Krupski served Costa Cruise on February 4, 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the next several months\xe2\x80\x94after the limitations period had expired\xe2\x80\x94Costa Cruise brought Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s existence to Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s attention three times.  First, on February 25, 2008, Costa Cruise filed its answer, asserting that it was not the proper defendant, as it was merely the North American sales and marketing agent for Costa Crociere, which was the actual carrier and vessel operator.  <em>Id.,</em> at 31.  Second, on March 20, 2008, Costa Cruise listed Costa Crociere as an interested party in its corporate disclosure statement.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.  Finally, on May 6, 2008, Costa Cruise moved for summary judgment, again stating that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant.  App. 5, 33\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 13, 2008, Krupski responded to Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment, arguing for limited discovery to determine whether Costa Cruise should be dismissed.  According to Krupski, the following sources of information led her to believe Costa Cruise was the responsible party: The travel documents prominently identified Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s Web site listed Costa Cruise in Florida as the United States office for the Italian company Costa Crociere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State listed Costa Cruise as the only \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x9d company registered to do business in that State.  <em>Id.,</em> at 43\xe2\x80\x9345, 56\xe2\x80\x9359.  Krupski also observed that Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s claims administrator had responded to her claims notification without indicating that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party.  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.  With her response, Krupski simultaneously moved to amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant.  <em>Id.,</em> at 41\xe2\x80\x9342, 52\xe2\x80\x9354.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 2, 2008, after oral argument, the District Court denied Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend, ordering that Krupski effect proper service on Costa Crociere by September 16, 2008.  <em>Id.,</em> at 71\xe2\x80\x9372.  Complying with the court\xe2\x80\x99s deadline, Krupski filed an amended complaint on July 11, 2008, and served Costa Crociere on August 21, 2008.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73, 88\xe2\x80\x9389.  On that same date, the District Court issued an order dismissing Costa Cruise from the case pursuant to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 joint stipulation, Krupski apparently having concluded that Costa Cruise was correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries.  <em>Id.,</em> at 85\xe2\x80\x9386.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter, Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x94represented by the same counsel who had represented Costa Cruise, compare <em>id.,</em> at 31, with <em>id.,</em> at 100\xe2\x80\x94moved to dismiss, contending that the amended complaint did not relate back under Rule 15(c) and was therefore untimely.  The District Court agreed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a\xe2\x80\x9322a.  Rule 15(c), the court explained, imposes three requirements before an amended complaint against a newly named defendant can relate back to the original complaint.  First, the claim against the newly named defendant must have arisen \xe2\x80\x9cout of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\xe2\x80\x94or attempted to be set out\xe2\x80\x94in the original pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa015(c)(1)(B), (C).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint\xe2\x80\x9d (which is ordinarily 120 days from when the complaint is filed, see Rule 4(m)), the newly named defendant must have \xe2\x80\x9creceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i).  Finally, the plaintiff must show that, within the Rule 4(m) period, the newly named defendant \xe2\x80\x9cknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two conditions posed no problem, the court explained: The claim against Costa Crociere clearly involved the same occurrence as the original claim against Costa Cruise, and Costa Crociere had constructive notice of the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice would result from relation back.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a\xe2\x80\x9318a.  But the court found the third condition fatal to Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to relate back, concluding that Krupski had not made a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party.  <em>Id.,</em> at 18a\xe2\x80\x9321a.  Relying on Eleventh Circuit precedent, the court explained that the word \xe2\x80\x9cmistake\xe2\x80\x9d should not be construed to encompass a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff knew before the statute of limitations had run.  Because Costa Cruise informed Krupski that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant in its answer, corporate disclosure statement, and motion for summary judgment, and yet Krupski delayed for months in moving to amend and then in filing an amended complaint, the court concluded that Krupski knew of the proper defendant and made no\nmistake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unpublished <em>per curiam</em> opinion.  <em>Krupski</em> v. <em>Costa Cruise Lines, N. V., LLC</em>, 330 Fed. Appx. 892 (2009).  Rather than relying on the information contained in Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s filings, all of which were made after the statute of limitations had expired, as evidence that Krupski did not make a mistake, the Court of Appeals noted that the relevant information was located within Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s passenger ticket, which she had furnished to her counsel well before the end of the limitations period.  Because the ticket clearly identified Costa Crociere as the carrier, the court stated, Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s identity as a potential party.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It was therefore appropriate to treat Krupski as having chosen to sue one potential party over another.  Alternatively, even assuming that she first learned of Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s identity as the correct party from Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s answer, the Court of Appeals observed that Krupski waited 133 days from the time she filed her original complaint to seek leave to amend and did not file an amended complaint for another month after that.

Appx., at 895.  By focusing on Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the Court of Appeals chose the wrong starting point.  The question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or should have known the identity of Costa Crociere as the proper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known that it would have been named as a defendant but for an error.  Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) asks what the prospective <em>defendant</em> knew or should have known during the Rule 4(m) period, not what the <em>plaintiff</em> knew or should have known at the time of filing her original complaint.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Information in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s possession is relevant only if it bears on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  For purposes of that inquiry, it would be error to conflate knowledge of a party\xe2\x80\x99s existence with the absence of mistake.  A mistake is \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n error, misconception, or misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1092 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmistake\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca misunderstanding of the meaning or implication of something\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9ca wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9can erroneous belief\xe2\x80\x9d; or \xe2\x80\x9ca state of mind not in accordance with the facts\xe2\x80\x9d).  That a plaintiff knows of a party\xe2\x80\x99s existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  A plaintiff may know that a prospective defendant\xe2\x80\x94call him party A\xe2\x80\x94exists, while erroneously believing him to have the status of party B.  Similarly, a plaintiff may know generally what party A does while misunderstanding the roles that party A and party B played in the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d giving rise to her claim.  If the plaintiff sues party B instead of party A under these circumstances, she has made a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity\xe2\x80\x9d notwithstanding her knowledge of the existence of both parties.  The only question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii), then, is whether party A knew or should have known that, absent some mistake, the action would have been brought against him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent urges that the key issue under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate choice to sue one party over another.  Brief for Respondent 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  We agree that making a deliberate choice to sue one party instead of another while fully understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties is the antithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  We disagree, however, with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s position that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake.  The reasonableness of the mistake is not itself at issue.  As noted, a plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a misunderstanding about his status or role in the events giving rise to the claim at issue, and she may mistakenly choose to sue a different defendant based on that misimpression.  That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does not foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is consistent with the purpose of relation back: to balance the interests of the defendant protected by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1966 Notes 122; 3 Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa715.02[1], 15.19[3][a] (3d ed. 2009).  A prospective defendant who legitimately believed that the limitations period had passed without any attempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose.  But repose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant who understood, or who should have understood, that he escaped suit during the limitations period only because the plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his identity.  Because a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the existence of a party does not foreclose the possibility that she has made a mistake of identity about which that party should have been aware, such knowledge does not support that party\xe2\x80\x99s interest in repose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our reading is also consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).  That provision was added in 1966 to respond to a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Government, particularly in the Social Security context.  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1966 Notes 122.  Individuals who had filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative denial of benefits often failed to name the party identified in the statute as the proper defendant\xe2\x80\x94the current Secretary of what was then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\xe2\x80\x94and named instead the United States; the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself; the nonexistent \xe2\x80\x9cFederal Security Administration\xe2\x80\x9d; or a Secretary who had recently retired from office.  <em>Ibid.</em>  By the time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the statute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the district courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the ground that the amended complaints would not relate back.  Rule 15(c) was therefore \xe2\x80\x9camplified to provide a general solution\xe2\x80\x9d to this problem.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It is conceivable that the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably should have known the identity of the proper defendant either because of documents in their administrative cases or by dint of the statute setting forth the filing requirements.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7405(g) (1958 ed., Supp. III).  Nonetheless, the Advisory Committee clearly meant their filings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent suggests that our decision in <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>Adams USA, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/460/index.html">529 U. S. 460</a> (2000), forecloses the reading of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt today.  We disagree.  In that case, Adams USA, Inc. (Adams), had obtained an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees against the corporation of which Donald Nelson was the president and sole shareholder.  After Adams became concerned that the corporation did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams sought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and simultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold Nelson responsible.  The District Court granted both motions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  We reversed, holding that the requirements of due process, as codified in Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, demand that an added party have the opportunity to respond before judgment is entered against him.  <em>Id.,</em> at 465\xe2\x80\x93467.  In a footnote explaining that relation back does not deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the amended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise under the \xe2\x80\x9cmistake clause\xe2\x80\x9d of Rule 15(c):[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cRespondent Adams made no such mistake.  It knew of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s role and existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading, chose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against [Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s company].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 467, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim, <em>Nelson</em> does not suggest that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff knew of the prospective defendant\xe2\x80\x99s existence at the time she filed her original complaint.  In that case, there was nothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was an intended party, while there was evidence in the record (of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add him only after learning that the company would not be able to satisfy the judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 463\xe2\x80\x93464.  This evidence countered any implication that Adams had originally failed to name Nelson because of any \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity,\xe2\x80\x9d and instead suggested that Adams decided to name Nelson only after the fact in an attempt to ensure that the fee award would be paid.  The footnote merely observes that Adams had originally been under no misimpression about the function Nelson played in the underlying dispute.  We said, after all, that Adams knew of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crole\xe2\x80\x9d as well as his existence.  <em>Id.,</em> at 467, n.\xc2\xa01.  Read in context, the footnote in <em>Nelson</em> is entirely consistent with our understanding of the Rule: When the original complaint and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s conduct compel the conclusion that the failure to name the prospective defendant in the original complaint was the result of a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake concerning the proper defendant\xe2\x80\x99s identity, the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met.  This conclusion is in keeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge to deny relation back.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had unduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended complaint.  330 Fed. Appx., at 895.  The Court of Appeals offered no support for its view that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none.  The Rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation back, and the amending party\xe2\x80\x99s diligence is not among them.  Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back once the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are satisfied; it does not leave the decision whether to grant relation back to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable discretion.  See Rule 15(c)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn amendment \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>relates back</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 when\xe2\x80\x9d the three listed requirements are met (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back under Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circumstances in which a party may amend its pleading before trial.  By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the district court in deciding whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading to add a party or a claim.  Following an initial period after filing a pleading during which a party may amend once \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s written consent or the court\xe2\x80\x99s leave,\xe2\x80\x9d which the court \xe2\x80\x9cshould freely give \xe2\x80\xa6 when justice so requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rules 15(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  We have previously explained that a court may consider a movant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundue delay\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdilatory motive\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule 15(a).  <em>Foman</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/178/index.html">371 U. S. 178</a>, 182 (1962).  As the contrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear, however, the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend her complaint or files an amended complaint after obtaining leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended complaint relates back.  Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71498, pp. 142\xe2\x80\x93143, and nn. 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the way or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals suggests.  As we have explained, the question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasonably should have understood about the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s intent in filing the original complaint against the first defendant.  To the extent the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling conduct informs the prospective defendant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity,\xe2\x80\x9d a court may consider the conduct.  Cf. <em>Leonard</em> v. <em>Parry</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa03d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ost-filing events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind at an earlier time\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccan inform <em>a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s</em> reasonable beliefs concerning whether her omission from the original complaint represented a mistake (as opposed to a conscious choice)\xe2\x80\x9d).  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s postfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the question whether an amended complaint relates back.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we think it clear that the courts below erred in denying relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).  The District Court held that Costa Crociere had \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive notice\xe2\x80\x9d of Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s complaint within the Rule 4(m) period.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a\xe2\x80\x9317a.  Costa Crociere has not challenged this finding.  Because the complaint made clear that Krupski meant to sue the company that \xe2\x80\x9cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\xe2\x80\x9d the ship on which she was injured, App. 23, and also indicated (mistakenly) that Costa Cruise performed those roles, <em>id.,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9327, Costa Crociere should have known, within the Rule 4(m) period, that it was not named as a defendant in that complaint only because of Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstanding about which \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x9d entity was in charge of the ship\xe2\x80\x94clearly a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Respondent contends that because the original complaint referred to the ticket\xe2\x80\x99s forum requirement and presuit claims notification procedure, Krupski was clearly aware of the contents of the ticket, and because the ticket identified Costa Crociere as the carrier and proper party for a lawsuit, respondent was entitled to think that she made a deliberate choice to sue Costa Cruise instead of Costa Crociere.  Brief for Respondent 13.  As we have explained, however, that Krupski may have known the contents of the ticket does not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the two companies\xe2\x80\x99 identities.  Especially because the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention is not persuasive.  Moreover, respondent has articulated no strategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent also argues that Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move to amend her complaint during the Rule 4(m) period shows that she made no mistake in that period.  <em>Id.,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  But as discussed, any delay on Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s part is relevant only to the extent it may have informed Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s understanding during the Rule 4(m) period of whether she made a mistake originally.  Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s failure to add Costa Crociere during the Rule 4(m) period is not sufficient to make reasonable any belief that she had made a deliberate and informed decision not to sue Costa Crociere in the first instance.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Nothing in Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a mistake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also worth noting that Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere are related corporate entities with very similar names; \xe2\x80\x9ccrociera\xe2\x80\x9d even means \xe2\x80\x9ccruise\xe2\x80\x9d in Italian.  Cassell\xe2\x80\x99s Italian Dictionary 137, 670 (1967).  This interrelationship and similarity heighten the expectation that Costa Crociere should suspect a mistake has been made when Costa Cruise is named in a complaint that actually describes Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  Cf. <em>Morel</em> v. <em>DaimlerChrysler AG</em>, 565 F.\xc2\xa03d 20, 27 (CA1 2009) (where complaint conveyed plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to sue automobile manufacturer and erroneously named the manufacturer as Daimler-Chrysler Corporation instead of the actual manufacturer, a legally distinct but related entity named DaimlerChrysler AG, the latter should have realized it had not been named because of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 mistake); <em>Goodman</em> v. <em>Praxair, Inc.</em>, 494 F.\xc2\xa03d 458, 473\xe2\x80\x93475 (CA4 2007) (en banc) (where complaint named parent company Praxair, Inc., but described status of subsidiary company Praxair Services, Inc., subsidiary company knew or should have known it had not been named because of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s mistake).  In addition, Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper party\xe2\x80\x9d for a lawsuit.  The front of the ticket advertises that \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruises\xe2\x80\x9d has achieved a certification of quality, App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, without clarifying whether \xe2\x80\x9cCosta Cruises\xe2\x80\x9d is Costa Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, or some other related \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x9d company.  Indeed, Costa Crociere is evidently aware that the difference between Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere can be confusing for cruise ship passengers.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Suppa</em> v. <em>Costa Crociere, S. p. A.</em>, No. 07\xe2\x80\x9360526\xe2\x80\x93CIV, 2007 WL 4287508, *1, (SD Fla., Dec. 4, 2007) (denying Costa Crociere\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the amended complaint where the original complaint had named Costa Cruise as a defendant after \xe2\x80\x9cfind[ing] it simply inconceivable that Defendant Costa Crociere was not on notice \xe2\x80\xa6 that \xe2\x80\xa6 but for the mistake in the original Complaint, Costa Crociere was the appropriate party to be named in the action\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these facts, Costa Crociere should have known that Krupski\xe2\x80\x99s failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party\xe2\x80\x99s identity.

The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1966 Amendment clarify that \xe2\x80\x9cthe notice need not be formal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1966 Notes 122.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded that Krupski was not diligent merely because she did not seek leave to add Costa Crociere until 133 days after she filed her original complaint and did not actually file an amended complaint for another a month after that.  330 Fed.

It is not clear why Krupski should have been found dilatory for not accepting at face value the unproven allegations in Costa Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s answer and corporate disclosure form.  In fact, Krupski moved to amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere within the time period prescribed by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s scheduling order.
