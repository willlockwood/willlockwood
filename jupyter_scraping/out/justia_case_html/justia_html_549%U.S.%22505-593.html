S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(b)(1), and empowers the Attorney General to certify that a federal employee sued for wrongful or negligent conduct \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1), (2).  Upon such certification, the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee, and the action is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act.  If the action commenced in state court, the Westfall Act calls for its removal to a federal district court, and renders the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiff-petitioner Pat Osborn sued federal employee Barry Haley in state court.  Osborn alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor, that he conspired to cause her wrongful discharge, and that his efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment.  The United States Attorney, serving as the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s delegate, certified that Haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the conduct alleged in Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  She thereupon removed the case to a federal district court, where she asserted that the alleged wrongdoing never occurred.  The District Court, relying in Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, entered an order that rejected the Westfall Act certification, denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to substitute the United States as defendant in Haley\xe2\x80\x99s place, and remanded the case to the state court.  The Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order, holding that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff centrally relies.  Based on \xc2\xa72679(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s direction that certification is \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of removal,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to retain jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, i.e.</em>, once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court.

Under the collateral order doctrine of <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a>, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, which effectively denied Haley Westfall Act protection, qualifies as a reviewable final decision under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291.  Meeting <em>Cohen</em>\xe2\x80\x99s three criteria, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of certification and substitution conclusively decided a contested issue, the issue decided is important and separate from the merits of the action, and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition would be effectively unreviewable later in the litigation.  337 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d), which states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court \xe2\x80\xa6 is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court held, in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hermansdorfer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/336/index.html">423 U. S. 336</a>, that \xc2\xa71447(c) confines \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Section \xc2\xa71447(c) provides that a case must be remanded \xe2\x80\x9cif \xe2\x80\xa6 it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under <em>Thermtron</em>, \xe2\x80\x9conly remand orders issued under \xc2\xa71447(c) and invoking the [mandatory ground] specified therein \xe2\x80\xa6 are immune from review\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71447(d).  <em>Id</em>., at 346.  To determine whether <em>Thermtron</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning controls here, the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand of actions filed in state court, must be examined. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Attorney General certifies that a federal employee named defendant in a state-court tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question, the action \xe2\x80\x9cshall be removed\xe2\x80\x9d to federal court and the United States must be substituted as the defendant.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).  Of prime importance here, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) concludes with the command that the \xe2\x80\x9ccertification of the Attorney General shall <em>conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  This directive markedly differs from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 instruction for cases in which the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9crefuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(3).  In that event, the defendant-employee may petition the court in which the action is instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification.  If the employee so petitions in an action filed in state court, the Attorney General may, at his discretion, remove the action to federal court.  If removal has occurred, and thereafter \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>shall be remanded to the State court</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification and those in which he does not leads to the conclusion that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification was unwarranted.  Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant for purposes of trial if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope-of-employment certification was incorrect.  For purposes of establishing a forum for adjudication, however, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification dispositive.  Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification was erroneous, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s final instruction would be weightless.  Congress adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for the purposes of removal\xe2\x80\x9d language to \xe2\x80\x9cforeclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 433, n.\xc2\xa010.  The provision assures that \xe2\x80\x9conce a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 440 (Souter, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Thermtron</em> held that \xc2\xa71447(d) must be read together with \xc2\xa71447(c).  There is stronger cause to hold that \xc2\xa71447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).  Both \xc2\xa71447(d) and \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions that aim to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cprolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/742/index.html">327 U. S. 742</a>, 751.  Once the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.  By declaring certification conclusive as to the federal forum\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to state court based on the court\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope-of-employment determination.  Of the two antishuttling commands, \xc2\xa71447(d) and \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), only one can prevail and the Court holds that the latter controls.  Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively\xe2\x80\x9d determines that the action shall be adjudicated in the federal forum, and may not be returned to the state system.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.  An Article III question could arise in this case only if, after full consideration, the District Court determined that Haley engaged in tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment.  Because, at that point, little would be left to adjudicate as to his liability, and because a significant federal question (whether he has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law as that term is used in Article III.  Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have authority, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Attorney General concludes, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9324. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is appropriate to afford protection to an employee on duty at the time and place of an \xe2\x80\x9cincident\xe2\x80\x9d alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred.  Just as the Government\xe2\x80\x99s certification that an employee \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his employment\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to threshold judicial review, <em>Lamagno</em>, 515 U. S., at 434, so a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation.  Otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.  This position is supported by <em>Willingham</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/402/index.html">395 U. S. 402</a>, which concerned 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442, the federal officer removal statute.  Section 1442 allows a federal officer to remove a civil action from state court if the officer is \xe2\x80\x9csued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court held in <em>Willingham</em> that the language of \xc2\xa71442 is \xe2\x80\x9cbroad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  395 U. S., at 406\xe2\x80\x93407.  There is no reason to conclude that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remove a suit to federal court under \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), unlike a federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remove under \xc2\xa71442, should be controlled by the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Tugging against this reading is a \xe2\x80\x9cwho decides\xe2\x80\x9d concern.  If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, in fact, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial.  Upon the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification, however, the action is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be \xe2\x80\xa6 brought against the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), and the Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in common-law suits, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign.  Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial.  The Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose\xe2\x80\x94to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit and to place those burdens on the Government\xe2\x80\x94also bears on the appropriate trier of any facts essential to certification.  Immunity-related issues should be decided at the earliest opportunity.  See, <em>e.g., Hunter</em> v. <em>Bryant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/224/index.html">502 U.

See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).  When a federal employee is sued for wrongful or negligent conduct, the Act empowers the Attorney General to certify that the employee \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1), (2).  Upon the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification, the employee is dismissed from the action, and the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee.  The litigation is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 60 Stat. 842.  If the action commenced in state court, the case is to be removed to a federal district court, and the certification remains \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 420 (1995), we held that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Westfall Act scope-of-employment certification is subject to judicial review.  Today, we address three further questions regarding the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s operation: (1) Is Attorney General certification proper when a federal officer denies the occurrence of the tortious conduct alleged by the plaintiff; (2) does \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), by rendering the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of removal,\xe2\x80\x9d bar remand even if the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee; and (3) does 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s bar on appellate review of remand orders override \xc2\xa72679(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s direction that, for purposes of removal, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is conclusive.  The first two questions were advanced in the petition for certiorari; in our order granting review, we asked the parties to address the impact of \xc2\xa71447(d) on this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pat Osborn, plaintiff-petitioner in the civil action now before the Court, sued federal employee Barry Haley in a Kentucky state court.  She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge.  Osborn further alleged that Haley\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment.  The United States Attorney, serving as the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s delegate, countered Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations by certifying that Haley \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his employment \xe2\x80\xa6 at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s] complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief in Opposition 23 (hereinafter Luber App.).  Based on this certification, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, as \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) instructs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the federal forum, the United States Attorney denied the tortious conduct Osborn attributed to Haley, asserting that the wrongdoing she alleged never occurred.  Accepting Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true, the District Court entered an order that rejected the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Westfall Act certification, denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to substitute the United States as defendant in place of Haley, and remanded the case to the state court.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order, and instructed that court to retain jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.  On the merits, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that the District Court, in denying substitution of the United States as defendant in lieu of Haley, misconstrued the Westfall Act.   Substitution of the United States is not improper simply because the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification rests on an understanding of the facts that differs from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  The United States, we hold, must remain the federal defendant in the action unless and until the District Court determines that the employee, <em>in fact</em>, and not simply as alleged by the plaintiff, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment.  On the jurisdictional issues, we hold that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, <em>i.e.</em>, once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court.  We also hold that \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s bar on appellate review of remand orders does not displace \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), which shields from remand an action removed pursuant to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Pat Osborn worked for Land Between the Lakes Association (LBLA), a private company that contracted with the United States Forest Service to provide staff for the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  While employed by LBLA, Osborn applied for a trainee position with the Forest Service.  Respondent Barry Haley, a Forest Service officer, was responsible for the Service\xe2\x80\x99s hiring process.  At a meeting with LBLA employees, Haley announced that he had hired someone else for the job Osborn sought.  Osborn asked why Haley did not inform her before the meeting, and she made a joke at Haley\xe2\x80\x99s expense.  After the meeting, Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor told her to apologize to Haley; she refused.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few weeks later, Osborn filed a complaint with the United States Department of Labor, asking the Department to investigate whether the Forest Service, in its hiring decision, had given appropriate consideration to the veterans\xe2\x80\x99 preference points to which she was entitled.  The Department\xe2\x80\x99s investigator, Robert Kuenzli, after interviewing Haley, concluded that the hiring procedure had been handled correctly.  Kuenzli so informed Osborn, who then asked him to close her complaint.  On the same day LBLA\xe2\x80\x99s executive director, respondent Gaye Luber, summoned Osborn and demanded that she apologize to Haley for \xe2\x80\x9cnot being a good Forest Service partner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb618, Luber App. 4.  Osborn again refused.  Two days later, she was fired.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Osborn filed suit against Haley, Luber, and LBLA in a Kentucky state court.  She alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment relationship with LBLA and conspired to cause her wrongful discharge.  Specifically, she charged that Haley maliciously induced Luber to fire her, and that Haley did so in retaliation for Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Labor complaint requesting a veterans\xe2\x80\x99 preference inquiry.  Complaint \xc2\xb629, Luber App. 7.  In response the local United States Attorney, invoking the Westfall Act, certified on behalf of the Attorney General that Haley \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his employment with the U. S. Forest Service at the time of the conduct alleged in [Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s] complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Luber App. 23.  As is customary, the certification stated no reasons for the determination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Westfall Act, Congress instructed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUpon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending.  Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.  <em>This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nCiting this provision, as well as the federal officer removal statute, \xc2\xa71442,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the United States removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  The United States Attorney notified the District Court that the United States should be substituted for Haley as defendant, and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Osborn had not  exhausted administrative remedies, as required by the FTCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Osborn opposed the substitution and the motion to dismiss.  She argued that Haley\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was outside the scope of his employment, hence the Westfall Act afforded him no immunity.  As support for her opposition, Osborn submitted a memorandum of understanding between the LBLA and the Forest Service, which cautioned Forest Service employees against involvement in LBLA employment decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apparently under the impression that the United States, at that preliminary stage, did not dispute Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations, the District Court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing.  Under Kentucky law, the court observed, if Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations were true, Haley had acted outside the scope of his employment.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view the closeness in time of Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s request for a Department of Labor investigation, Kuenzli\xe2\x80\x99s call to Haley, and Luber\xe2\x80\x99s demand for an apology justified an inference that Haley interfered with Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s employment in violation of the LBLA-Forest Service memorandum of understanding.  So reasoning, the District Court overruled the Westfall Act certification and denied substitution.  Under this ruling, the United States was no longer before the court.  Furthermore, the parties were not of diverse citizenship and no federal law was at issue.  The District Court therefore held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Invoking \xc2\xa71447(c),[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the court concluded that the case must be remanded to the state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States moved for reconsideration, urging that, contrary to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s impression, the Government did contest Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations.  Recalling that it had denied Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations in its answer to her complaint, the United States submitted sworn declarations from Haley and Luber.  Haley\xe2\x80\x99s stated that he was not in communication with Luber between the time of Kuenzli\xe2\x80\x99s investigation and Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s firing.  Luber\xe2\x80\x99s declaration stated that Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s request for an investigation regarding her veterans\xe2\x80\x99 preference points could not have had any bearing on Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s termination, for Luber was unaware of the request at the relevant time.  Absent contrary evidence, the Government maintained, these declarations sufficed to support the certification and the continuance of the United States as defendant in place of Haley.  In the alternative, the Government sought discovery.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reconsideration motion.  The Haley and Luber declarations, the court said, clarified that the controversy centered on whether there had been any communication between Haley and Luber influencing Luber\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire Osborn.  The Westfall Act would have shielded Haley, the Court suggested, had the United States admitted a Haley-Luber communication but defended its content as within the scope of Haley\xe2\x80\x99s employment.  Westfall Act certification was improper, the court concluded, because the United States did not admit, but instead denied, the occurrence of the event central to proof of Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The District Court acknowledged disagreement among the Circuits on the availability of a Westfall Act certification when the United States \xe2\x80\x9cden[ies] the occurrence of the basic incident charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 995 F.\xc2\xa02d 1122, 1124 (CA1 1993) (en banc).  Compare <em>ibid</em>. and <em>McHugh</em> v. <em>University of Vermont</em>, 966 F.\xc2\xa02d 67, 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (CA2 1992) (prohibiting incident-denying certifications), with <em>Heuton</em> v. <em>Anderson</em>, 75 F.\xc2\xa03d 357, 360 (CA8 1996); <em>Kimbro</em> v. <em>Velten</em>, 30 F.\xc2\xa03d 1501, 1508 (CADC 1994); and <em>Melo</em> v. <em>Hafer</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d 736, 746\xe2\x80\x93747 (CA3 1994) (allowing incident-denying certifications).  Choosing to follow the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Wood</em>, the District Court adhered to its prior ruling that the Westfall Act certification in this case was invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying certification and substitution.  422 F.\xc2\xa03d 359, 365 (2005).  The Court of Appeals, in accord with <em>Heuton</em>, <em>Kimbro</em>, and <em>Melo</em>, held that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff centrally relies.  422 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 364.  Rather, the court held, where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is based on a different understanding of the facts than is reflected in the complaint, including a denial of the harm-causing incident, the district court must resolve the factual dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting <em>Melo</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 747).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit also vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order remanding the case to the state court.  Section 2679(d)(2), the Court of Appeals stressed, instructs that the \xe2\x80\x9ccertification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court read that instruction to proscribe shuttling cases back to state courts and, instead, to require district court adjudication of the controversy even when a Westfall Act certification is rejected and, correspondingly, substitution of the United States as defendant is denied.  422 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 365.  On that issue too, the Court of Appeals noted a division among the Circuits.  Compare <em>Borneman</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 213 F.\xc2\xa03d 819, 826 (CA4 2000); <em>Garcia</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 88 F.\xc2\xa03d 318, 325\xe2\x80\x93327 (CA5 1996); and <em>Aliota</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, 984 F.\xc2\xa02d 1350, 1356 (CA3 1993) (holding that a district court lacks authority to remand a case removed under \xc2\xa72679(d)(2)), with <em>Haddon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 68 F.\xc2\xa03d 1420, 1427 (CADC 1995); and <em>Nasuti</em> v. <em>Scannell</em>, 906 F.\xc2\xa02d 802, 814, n.\xc2\xa017 (CA1 1990) (holding remand proper when district court rejects the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise\xe2\x80\x9d?  In answering this question, we also resolve the second question presented in the petition for certiorari\xe2\x80\x94whether the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s rule against remanding actions removed pursuant to \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) applies when the federal court determines that the United States should not be substituted as defendant in place of the federal employee.  Our disposition is informed by, and tracks, the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Aliota</em>, 984 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1354\xe2\x80\x931357.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the provision we asked the parties to address: \xc2\xa71447(d).  That provision states in relevant part: \xe2\x80\x9cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Thermtron Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hermansdorfer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/336/index.html">423 U. S. 336</a> (1976), we held that the preceding subsection, \xc2\xa71447(c), confined \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Under \xc2\xa71447(d), the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9conly remand orders issued under \xc2\xa71447(c) and invoking the [mandatory] grounds specified therein\xe2\x80\x94that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94are immune from review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 346.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Thermtron</em> had been properly removed to the federal court.  The sole reason the District Court gave for remanding it was that court\xe2\x80\x99s crowded docket.  This Court held the remand order reviewable, observing that \xc2\xa71447(c) could not sensibly be read to confer on the district courts \xe2\x80\x9ccarte blanche authority \xe2\x80\xa6 to revise the federal statutes governing removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 351.  See also <em>Quackenbush</em> v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/706/index.html">517 U. S. 706</a> (1996) (holding abstention-based remand order immediately appealable).  But see <em>Gravitt</em> v. <em>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/723/index.html">430 U. S. 723</a> (1977) <em>(per curiam)</em> (holding unreviewable a remand order purporting to rest on a ground within the scope of \xc2\xa71447(c)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States urges us to apply <em>Thermtron</em> and hold the remand order in this case reviewable because that order was not based on a ground specified in \xc2\xa71447(c).  To determine whether <em>Thermtron</em> controls, we must start with an examination of the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand of actions filed in state court.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 1, the Act grants the Attorney General authority to certify that a federal employee named defendant in a tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1), (2).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the action is commenced in a federal court, and the Attorney General certifies that the employee \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his office or employment at the [relevant] time,\xe2\x80\x9d the United States must be substituted as the defendant.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1).  If the action is launched in a state court, and the Attorney General makes the same certification, the action \xe2\x80\x9cshall be removed\xe2\x80\x9d to the appropriate federal district court, and again the United States must be substituted as the defendant.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).  Of prime importance to our decision, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) concludes with the command: \xe2\x80\x9cTh[e] certification of the Attorney General shall <em>conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This directive markedly differs from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 instruction for cases in which the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9crefuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(3).  In that event, the defendant employee may petition the court in which the action was instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification.  If the complaint was filed in a state court, the Attorney General <em>may </em>remove the case to the appropriate federal court, but he is not obliged to do so.  <em>Ibid</em>.  If the court, state or federal, issues the certification, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  If removal has occurred, and thereafter \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>shall be remanded to the State court</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification, and those in which he does not, leads us to conclude that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification was unwarranted.  Absent certification, \xc2\xa72679(d)(3) directs that the case must be remanded to the state court in which the action commenced.  In contrast, when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, his certificate \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively establish[es] scope of office or employment <em>for purposes of removal</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) (emphasis added).  Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant <em>for purposes of trial</em> if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope-of-employment certification was incorrect.  For purposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case, however, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification dispositive.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification was erroneous, the final instruction in \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) would be weightless.  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification would not \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively establish scope of office or employment\xe2\x80\x9d for either trial or removal.  Instead, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope certification would supply only a tentative basis for removal, rather than a conclusive one.  In <em>Lamagno</em>, the Court unanimously agreed that Congress spoke unambiguously on this matter: Congress adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of removal\xe2\x80\x9d language to \xe2\x80\x9cforeclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U. S., at 433, n.\xc2\xa010; see <em>id</em>., at 440 (Souter, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is nothing equivocal about [\xc2\xa72679(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s] provision that once a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions on removal of actions filed in state court in clear view, we return to the question whether an order remanding a case removed pursuant to \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) is reviewable.  <em>Thermtron</em> held that \xc2\xa71447(d) must be read together with \xc2\xa71447(c).  There is stronger cause, we conclude, to hold that \xc2\xa71447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).  Both \xc2\xa71447(d) and \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions.  Each aims to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cprolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/742/index.html">327 U. S. 742</a>, 751 (1946).  Section 2679(d)(2) is operative when the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum.  At that point, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The command that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification \xe2\x80\x9cshall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), differentiates certified Westfall Act cases from the typical case remanded for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Ordinarily, when the plaintiff moves to remand a removed case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the federal district court undertakes a threshold inquiry; typically the court determines whether complete diversity exists or whether the complaint raises a federal question.  In Attorney General certified Westfall Act cases, however, no threshold determination is called for; the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certificate forecloses any jurisdictional inquiry.  By declaring the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d as to the federal forum\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to the state court where it originated based on the court\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope-of-employment determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision that \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) leaves the district court without authority to send a certified case back to the state court scarcely means that whenever the district court misconstrues a jurisdictional statute, appellate review of the remand is in order.  Such an exception would, of course, collide head on with \xc2\xa71447(d), and with our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Things Remembered, Inc.</em> v. <em>Petrarca</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/124/index.html">516 U. S. 124</a>, 127\xe2\x80\x93128 (1995).  Only in the extraordinary case in which Congress has ordered the intercourt shuttle to travel just one way\xe2\x80\x94from state to federal court\xe2\x80\x94does today\xe2\x80\x99s decision hold sway.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, of the two antishuttling commands, \xc2\xa71447(d) and \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), only one can prevail.  We hold that \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) controls.  Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) is a forum-selecting rule Congress made \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the ken of district courts to revise.

S., at 434.  It was argued in that case that if certification is rejected and substitution denied \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the federal court concludes that the employee acted outside the scope of his employment, and if the tort plaintiff and the [defendant-employee] are not of diverse citizenship, \xe2\x80\xa6 then the federal court will be left with a case without a federal question to support the court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435.  <em>Lamagno</em> was an action commenced in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, so there was in that case \xe2\x80\x9cnot even the specter of an Article III problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 435.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the question would arise only if, after full consideration, the District Court determines that Haley in fact engaged in the tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment charged in Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  At that point, however, little would be left to adjudicate, at least as to Haley\xe2\x80\x99s liability.  Because a significant federal question (whether Haley has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would  \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law, as that term is used in Article III.  See <em>Verlinden B. V.</em> v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/index.html">461 U. S. 480</a>, 493 (1983).  Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have discretion, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction.  See <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ.</em> v. <em>Cohill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/343/index.html">484 U. S. 343</a>, 350\xe2\x80\x93351 (1988) (when federal character of removed case is eliminated while the case is <em>sub judice</em>, court has discretion to retain jurisdiction, to remand, or to dismiss); cf. <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Gibbs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/index.html">383 U.

Thus, under the precedent that guides us, the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the jurisdictional issues resolved, we reach the principal question raised by petitioner Osborn: whether the United States Attorney validly certified that Haley \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his employment \xe2\x80\xa6 at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Luber App. 23.  We note first that the certificate is formally in order; it closely tracks the language of the Westfall Act.  See \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) (authorizing certification \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>Lamagno</em>, we held that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is \xe2\x80\x9cthe first, but not the final word\xe2\x80\x9d on whether the federal officer is immune from suit and, correlatively, whether the United States is properly substituted as defendant.  515 U. S., at 432.  A plaintiff may request judicial review of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s scope-of-employment determination, as Osborn did here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier recounted, see <em>supra</em>, at 6, the District Court initially accepted Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true because it believed that the United States did not dispute them.  Applying Kentucky law, that court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cHaley\xe2\x80\x99s alleged actions occurred outside the scope of his employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.  In a motion for reconsideration, the Government clarified that, far from admitting Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, it disputed the very occurrence of the harm-causing conduct Osborn alleged.  In support of the motion, the Government submitted affidavits from Haley and Luber denying that they engaged in the conduct ascribed to them in Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  The Government contended that Haley remained within the proper bounds of his employment at the relevant time and place because the wrongdoing Osborn alleged never happened.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reconsideration motion asked the District Court to resolve the factual dispute, <em>i.e.</em>, to determine whether, as the complaint alleged, Haley prevailed upon Luber to discharge Osborn, or whether, as Haley asserted, he never communicated with Luber about Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s LBLA employment.  The court did not grant the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request for resolution of the factual dispute.  Instead, it held the Westfall Act certification invalid precisely because the Government denied that Haley engaged in harm-causing conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two Courts of Appeals have held that Westfall Act certification is improper when the Government denies the occurrence of the alleged injury-causing action or episode.  See <em>Wood,</em> 995 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1123 (CA1); <em>McHugh,</em> 966 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (CA2).  The Sixth Circuit, in this case, and several other Courts of Appeals have held that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegation of conduct beyond the scope of a federal official\xe2\x80\x99s employment does not block certification where the Government contends that the alleged tortious conduct did not occur.  See <em>Heuton</em>, 75 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 360 (CA8); <em>Kimbro,</em> 30 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1508 (CADC); <em>Melo,</em> 13 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 746\xe2\x80\x93747 (CA3).  We agree that Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Government determines, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Westfall Act grants a federal employee suit immunity, we reiterate, when \xe2\x80\x9cacting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1), (2).  That formulation, we are persuaded, encompasses an employee on duty at the time and place of an \xe2\x80\x9cincident\xe2\x80\x9d alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred.  See <em>Wood</em>, 995 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1134 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]urely the statute applies with the same force whether a postal service driver says that he did not hit the plaintiff\'s car or that he did so but was not at fault.\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Melo</em>, 13 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 747.  And just as the Government\xe2\x80\x99s certification that an employee \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his employment\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to threshold judicial review, <em>Lamagno</em>, 515 U. S., at 434, so a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation.  Were it otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, given the purpose of the Westfall Act to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is altogether appropriate to afford protection to a \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent \xe2\x80\xa6 employee \xe2\x80\xa6 as a matter of course.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wood</em>, 995 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1135 (joint opinion of Coffin, Selya, and Boudin, JJ., dissenting).  But it would make scant sense to read the Act as leaving an employee charged with an intentional tort[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] to fend for himself when he denies wrongdoing and asserts he \xe2\x80\x9cengaged only in proper behavior occurring wholly within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

The Tenth Circuit reversed, reading \xc2\xa71442(a)(1) to permit removal only when a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cexclude[s] the possibility that the suit is based on acts or conduct not justified by his federal duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan</em> v. <em>Willingham</em>, 383 F.\xc2\xa02d 139, 141 (1967).  We rejected that narrow construction of the statute and held \xc2\xa71442 \xe2\x80\x9cbroad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  395 U.

The Court held that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cshould have the opportunity to <em>present their version of the facts</em> to a federal, not a state, court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 409<em> </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no reason to conclude that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remove a suit to federal court under \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), unlike a federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remove under \xc2\xa71442,  should be controlled by the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  In <em>Willingham</em>, the federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelationship to [the plaintiff] derived solely from their official duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Similarly here, Haley interacted with Osborn and Luber only through his employment as a Forest Service officer.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  For purposes of removal under \xc2\xa71442(a), the defendants in <em>Willingham</em> were not required to accept the truth of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations that they were \xe2\x80\x9con a frolic of their own,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 407 (internal quotation marks omitted), and had tortured plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cout of malice,\xe2\x80\x9d 383 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 140 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So here, for purposes of removal under \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), Haley and the Government were not required to accept as true Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations that Haley \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously induced\xe2\x80\x9d her dismissal from LBLA \xe2\x80\x9cin retaliation for plaintiff filing a veterans\xe2\x80\x99 preference inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb629, Luber App. 7.  Haley, like the defendant in <em>Willingham</em>, may have been on frolic of his own as Osborn alleged, and therefore may not be entitled to immunity.

If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, <em>in fact</em>, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial.

Upon certification, the action is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be \xe2\x80\xa6 brought against the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., unless and until the district court determines that the federal officer originally named as defendant was acting outside the scope of his employment.  The Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in suits at common law, we have held, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign.  <em>Lehman</em> v. <em>Nakshian</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/index.html">453 U.

We need not today decide whether qualification for Westfall Act immunity is similarly limited, for in this case, a nexus plainly exists connecting the incident Osborn alleged and Haley\xe2\x80\x99s federal employment.  We note, however, that nothing in our opinion commits the Court to the view that Westfall Act immunity is available in fanciful situations like the one Justice Breyer hypothesizes, <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, in which the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are wholly unrelated to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s federal employment.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer posits the case of a Yellowstone Park forest ranger accused of misdeeds at Coney Island.  He says we would find Westfall Act immunity\xe2\x80\x94more accurately, we would uphold Westfall Act certification\xe2\x80\x94even if the ranger\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpresen[ce] on Coney Island must have been \xe2\x80\xa6 on a frolic of his own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  If Justice Breyer is imagining a case in which the ranger was in fact on a frolic at Coney Island, but the Attorney General nevertheless issued a Westfall Act certificate, we would not approve the certification.  In that imaginary case, there would be no sense in which the ranger was acting within the scope of his employment <em>at the time</em> of the incident charged in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  If, instead, Justice Breyer has in mind a ranger accused of frolicking at Coney Island, when all the while he stayed close to his desk at Yellowstone Park, then Justice Breyer is correct: Westfall Act immunity might be available under our approach.  If such a case ever shows up in a federal court, however, the district judge might be called upon to determine whether removal and substitution under \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) are limited by a nexus requirement similar to the one that limits removal under \xc2\xa71442.</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The overlap of certification validity and the merits of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim, evident here, is uncommon.  It is unlikely to occur when the plaintiff alleges negligent conduct.  The question whether a federal driver was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of an accident, for example, can generally be answered without simultaneously determining whether the federal employee drove negligently or carefully.  And even when the plaintiff alleges an intentional tort, it may be possible to resolve the scope-of-employment question without deciding the merits of the claim.  If a plaintiff charges a federal employee with sexual assault, for example, upon determining that there was sexual contact, a district court could find that the employee acted outside the scope of his duties, leaving the question whether the contact was consensual for jury resolution.</p>\n<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0But cf. 995 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1137 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not address the case in which the Attorney General refuses certification.  In that event, \xc2\xa72679(d)(3) allows the named defendant to \xe2\x80\x9cpetition the court to find and certify that [he] was acting within the scope of his \xe2\x80\xa6 employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, the Westfall Act gives the named defendant no right to remove an uncertified case.  But see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a)(1).  That right is accorded to the Attorney General only.  Because the scope determination would be made in such a case before any substitution of the United States as defendant takes place, it is arguable that a jury trial of that issue would be required if the case is before a federal court.  If the case was brought in a state court and the Attorney General declines to remove, the Seventh Amendment would not figure in the case, for it is inapplicable to proceedings in state court.  <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R.

Nothing in our opinion touches on that relationship in the typical case in which a defendant official raises a defense of absolute or qualified immunity.  We simply observe that the Westfall Act grants federal employees a species of immunity, and that, under our jurisprudence, immunity-related questions should be resolved at the earliest opportunity.  Justice Breyer is right, however, to this extent.  We recognize that judges have a greater factfinding role in Westfall Act cases than they traditionally have in other immunity contexts.  The Act makes that inevitable.  When Westfall Act immunity is in dispute, a district court is called upon to decide who the proper defendant is: the named federal employee, or the United States.  That decision cannot be left for jury resolution late in proceedings without undermining the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s very purpose: to shift the burden of defending the suit to the United States whenever the defendant-employee was, at the relevant time, acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962210">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nOSBORN V.

Having recognized, as it must, that the District Court in this case invoked \xc2\xa71447(c) and remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>ante</em>, at 6, the Court nevertheless reaches the amazing conclusion that \xc2\xa71447(d) does not \xe2\x80\x9ccontro[l]\xe2\x80\x9d whether the remand order is reviewable on appeal.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How can that be?  How can a statute explicitly eliminating appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order not \xe2\x80\x9ccontro[l]\xe2\x80\x9d whether an appellate court has jurisdiction to review a remand order?  The Court says the answer to this riddle lies in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(d)(2).  But that section says only that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification is \xe2\x80\x9cconclusiv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of <em>removal</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added); it says absolutely nothing about the reviewability of remand orders.  Thus, the most \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) can prove is that the District Court should not have remanded the case; that its remand order was erroneous.  But our precedents make abundantly clear that \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x99s appellate-review bar applies with full force to erroneous remand orders.  Just last Term we acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ca remand premised on an erroneous conclusion of no jurisdiction is unappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kircher</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 8).

Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion repudiates that principle.  The <em>only </em>basis for its holding is that \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) renders the remand erroneous.  This utterly novel proposition, that a remand order can be set aside when it is contrary to law, leaves nothing remaining of \xc2\xa71447(d).

S. 140</a> (1934).  See <em>ante, </em>at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (adopting this argument).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The continuing vitality of <em>Waco</em> is dubious in light of more recent precedents, see <em>Kircher</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___, n.\xc2\xa013 (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa013).  We need not address that question here, however, since <em>Waco </em>is patently inapposite.  There, removal had been premised on diversity jurisdiction.  The District Court dismissed the party whose citizenship was alleged to supply the requisite diversity, finding that party\xe2\x80\x99s joinder improper, and thus remanded the case for lack of jurisdiction.  We found the dismissal order to be reviewable on appeal, even though the remand order was not.  293 U. S., at 143.  But there is a crucial distinction between that case and this one: In <em>Waco</em>, reversal of the dismissal would not have subverted the remand.  There was <em>no question</em> that the suit would proceed in state court regardless of whether the diverse party was rightfully or wrongfully dismissed.  Nowhere did the <em>Waco</em> Court so much as hint that the District Court might need to reexamine its remand order; to the contrary, it was clear that the remand would occur, no matter what: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s [dismissal] order stands, the cross-action will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. <em>A reversal cannot affect the order of remand</em>, but it will at least, if the dismissal of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was erroneous, remit the entire controversy, with the [diverse party] still a party, to the state court for such further proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 143\xe2\x80\x93144 (emphasis added).  In other words, the remand order and the dismissal order were truly \xe2\x80\x9cseparate orders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 142; we could review\xe2\x80\x94even reverse\xe2\x80\x94the dismissal order without affecting the remand or its impact on the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s case far more closely resembles <em>Kircher</em>.  There, the remand order had been predicated upon a finding that the cause of action was not a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d class-action suit as defined by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112 Stat. 3227, and therefore that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction.  The District Court remanded so the suit could continue in state court, outside the confines of SLUSA.  If the suit had been \xe2\x80\x9ccovered,\xe2\x80\x9d SLUSA would have precluded the action from going forward in any court, state or federal.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777p(b).  We therefore determined that neither the remand itself <em>nor the determination of SLUSA inapplicability</em> was reviewable on appeal: \xe2\x80\x9cThe District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order here cannot be disaggregated as the <em>Waco</em> orders could, and if [we were to find the suit to be covered by SLUSA], there [would be] nothing to remand to state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, n.\xc2\xa013 (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, n.\xc2\xa013).  That is precisely the situation in this case: The remand here is predicated upon a finding that the United States should not be substituted as a defendant under the Westfall Act.  If we were to disagree with the District Court and substitute the United States as a defendant, while at the same time recognizing (as \xc2\xa71447(d) requires) that there is nothing we can do about the remand order, the case would go back to state court as an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), see <em>ante</em>, at 1, and the remanded case would be styled <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>United States</em>.  But the state court would have to dismiss such a case at once, since federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA suits.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  Thus, as in <em>Kircher</em>, but unlike <em>Waco</em>, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the preliminary matter\xe2\x80\x94here, Westfall Act certification; in <em>Kircher</em>, SLUSA applicability\xe2\x80\x94is inextricably intertwined with the remand order.

Title 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d) provides, with one exception not relevant here, that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  In sanctioning appellate review notwithstanding \xc2\xa71447(d), the Court relies on its determination that Congress, through \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), has prohibited remand in cases like this one, in order to give effect to the conclusive character of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s certification on the issue of removal jurisdiction.  But as we recently held, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kircher</em> v. <em>Putnam Funds Trust</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 7) (quoting <em>Briscoe</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/404/index.html">432 U. S. 404</a>, 414, n. 13 (1977)).  Thus, rather than allowing \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) to trump \xc2\xa71447(d), I would reaffirm the rule that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order is unreviewable even if it is based on an erroneous understanding of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But I would not otherwise limit the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s (or the employee\xe2\x80\x99s) efforts to give the intended effect to the certification prior to any remand that might be ordered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court, therefore, that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order resubstituting Haley as defendant.  That order was not \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed,\xe2\x80\x9d so by its own terms \xc2\xa71447(d) does not apply to review of that decision.  Allowing review of a resubstitution order makes good on the promise of the Westfall Act: by permitting disaggregation of a remand order from a substantive determination about substitution that preceded it (in the manner exemplified by <em>Waco</em> v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/140/index.html">293 U. S. 140</a> (1934)), it gives an employee-defendant a right to appeal any denial of the benefit of substituting the Government as defendant in costly litigation arising out of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s federal service.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The circumstances in which the Westfall Act was adopted, responding as it did to a series of our decisions that Congress saw as having \xe2\x80\x9cseriously eroded the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees,\xe2\x80\x9d 102 Stat. 4563, note following 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72671, point to the importance Congress placed on giving a federal employee a full opportunity to seek this protection.  Incidentally, of course, my reading of the statutes can give an appellate court the opportunity to correct a district court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous understanding of the legitimacy of removal before any remand is effected, making it very unlikely that a mistakenly premised remand order will be carried out.  If a district court resisted edification, however, the remand order would be conclusive against appeal, in accord with \xc2\xa71447(d).

The policy of avoiding litigation over remands is tempered by allowing appeals on the important matter of substitution.

But I dissent from Part III.  I continue to believe that the Westfall Act permits the Attorney General to certify only when accepting, at least conditionally, the existence of some kind of \xe2\x80\x9cincident.\xe2\x80\x9d  But where the incident, if it took place at all, <em>must have </em>fallen outside the scope of employment, the Act does not permit certification.  See <em>Wood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 995 F.\xc2\xa02d 1122 (CA1 1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Attorney General did claim, in the alternative, that <em>if </em>an incident took place (<em>i.e.</em>, if the federal employee Haley spoke to Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s employer with respect to Osborn\xe2\x80\x99s employment), any such incident would have fallen within the scope of Haley\xe2\x80\x99s employment.  But, for procedural reasons, that alternative claim is not before us.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa06<em>.  </em>Hence I must consider this case as if it were quite a different kind of case, one in which what took place was either an incident <em>outside the scope of employment </em>or no incident at all.  Consider, for example, an aggravated sexual assault, a theft of personal property, or an auto accident on Coney Island where the Government employee, say a Yellowstone Park forest ranger, if present on Coney Island must have been there on a frolic of his own.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach finds Westfall Act immunity in cases of this kind.  I would not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language suggests that it does not apply in such circumstances.  The statute says that the Attorney General must certify that the employee \xe2\x80\x9cwas acting within the scope of his office or employment <em>at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) (emphasis added).  The italicized words, read naturally, assume some kind of incident, the <em>characterization</em> of which (<em>e.g.</em>, as within the scope of employment) determines whether immunity attaches.  By way of contrast, permitting purely incident-denying certifications, as the majority does, can only be squared with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text if the Attorney General is required to supply the reviewing court with proof of what the employee <em>was</em> doing (and that such activities <em>were</em> within the scope of employment) \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the incident\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a showing that would prove quite difficult in a case such as this, where the plaintiff has alleged that the tort was committed at some unknown time over a period of days, or weeks, or even longer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another, there is nothing to suggest the Westfall Act sought to provide immunity for tort claims necessarily falling outside the scope of federal employment.  As its popular name suggests, the Act focused upon <em>Westfall</em> v. <em>Erwin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/292/index.html">484 U. S. 292</a> (1988), an earlier case in which the Court considered whether, to obtain immunity from state-law tort suits, a federal official had to show not just that his conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of [his] employment,\xe2\x80\x9d but also that it was \xe2\x80\x9c<em>discretionary in nature</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 295 (emphasis added).  The Court answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  It held that a federal employee was <em>not </em>immune from a state-law tort suit, even for simple negligence, unless the employee could also show that his conduct was discretionary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Westfall Act basically seeks to overturn this holding.  As this Court has said, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Congress wrote the Westfall Act \xe2\x80\xa6 , the legislators had one purpose firmly in mind [namely] to override <em>Westfall </em>v.<em> Erwin</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 425 (1995).  The House Judiciary Committee wrote that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional effect \xe2\x80\xa6 is to return Federal employees to the status they held prior to the <em>Westfall </em>decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93700, p.\xc2\xa04 (1988).  And that \xe2\x80\x9cstatus,\xe2\x80\x9d many thought, was an immunity that applied to nondiscretionary, as well as discretionary, actions that fell \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coffice or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(b)(1); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93700, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a word, the Act seeks to <em>maintain </em>the scope of pre-<em>Westfall </em>immunity <em>minus Westfall\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary function\xe2\x80\x9d limitation</em>.  That purpose does not encompass an extension of immunity to all-or-nothing conduct, <em>i.e.</em>, those serious assaults or personal \xe2\x80\x9cfrolics\xe2\x80\x9d that, <em>if they took place at all, </em>could not possibly have fallen within the scope of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coffice or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, to try to bring the latter type of conduct within the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s immunity creates a series of anomalies.  As the Court recognizes, its interpretation may limit the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain jury consideration of factual matters critical to his or her case.  Indeed, <em>any </em>Government employee defendant, including a defendant whom the Attorney General does <em>not </em>want to defend, can ask the judge to issue a certificate.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(3).  On the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute, the issuance of the certificate could depend upon whether, for example, the aggravated sexual assault took place at all or whether the defendant was at Yellowstone or Coney Island at the relevant times.  And, in deciding these questions (as the judge would have to do to determine whether the certificate should issue), the judge, not the jury, would decide the main issue in the case.  (The Court declines to address the effect of its analysis on \xc2\xa72679(d)(3).  <em>Ante</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa017.  But the relevant language in this provision is virtually identical to the language at issue in this case, see \xc2\xa72679(d)(2), so one cannot seriously suggest that the Act by its own terms affords employees any narrower a basis for seeking certification than it affords the Attorney General.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is highly unusual to permit special, speedy judge factfinding where immunity is at issue.  Ordinarily, when a party asserts an immunity defense, <em>i.e.</em>, an \xe2\x80\x9centitlement not to stand trial <em>under certain circumstances,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 525 (1985) (emphasis added), special immunity-related procedures focus, not upon factfinding, but upon the proper <em>legal characterization </em>of the facts as given.  Where the parties\xe2\x80\x99 immunity-related disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <em>law</em>, namely whether the particular set of facts alleged by the plaintiff does, or does not, fall within the immunity\xe2\x80\x99s legal scope, the defendant is entitled to a quick determination of the legal question by the trial judge and, if necessary, an immediate interlocutory appeal.  <em>Id.</em>, at 526, 530.  See <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/731/index.html">457 U. S. 731</a>, 742\xe2\x80\x93743 (1982); see also <em>Helstoski</em> v. <em>Meanor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/500/index.html">442 U. S. 500</a>, 507\xe2\x80\x93508 (1979).  But where that disagreement amounts to a dispute about the <em>facts, </em>immunity law does <em>not</em> ordinarily entitle the defendant to special procedural treatment.  Rather, the defendant must take the <em>facts </em>as the plaintiff asserts them.  Like any other defendant, he can move for summary judgment.  <em>Mitchell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 526; <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 646\xe2\x80\x93647, n. 6 (1987).  But if the plaintiff provides sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment, the defendant must win the case at trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus ordinarily an immunity defense provides special procedural treatment only for a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s legal claim that the facts <em>taken as the plaintiff asserts them </em>(or <em>taken as the assertions have survived a motion for summary judgment</em>) fall within the scope of the immunity.  It does not provide special treatment for disputes about the facts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/304/index.html">515 U. S. 304</a>, 319\xe2\x80\x93320 (1995) (defendant raising immunity defense \xe2\x80\x9cmay not appeal a district court\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a \xe2\x80\x98genuine\xe2\x80\x99 issue of fact for trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Westfall Act works a major change in this fact/law relationship.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the defendant will have the right to ask the judge to determine the facts, <em>i.e.</em>, to determine whether the events plaintiff says occurred did in fact happen.  And that is so <em>even where the plaintiff has enough evidence to bring the case to the jury</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Act proves even more anomalous in the case of a federal employee claiming an assault that violates both (a) state tort law and (b) federal civil rights law.  Suppose that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sole defense is \xe2\x80\x9cmistaken identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The defendant argues that nothing took place between him and the plaintiff, that at the relevant time he was working peacefully at his desk.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the defendant is entitled to have the <em>judge </em>decide the factual question; and, should the judge decide in his favor (in respect to the state-law tort claim), collateral estoppel likely means an end of the matter in respect to the federal civil rights claim, as well.  Yet the Westfall Act explicitly <em>exempts </em>from its scope any claim of \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of a federal statute\xe2\x80\x9d or the Federal Constitution.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72679(b)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rests much of its analysis on <em>Willingham</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/402/index.html">395 U. S. 402</a> (1969), but I do not think that case offers much support.  <em>Willingham</em> addressed <em>only</em> a federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s right to remove a case to federal court (via \xc2\xa71442(a)(1)).  <em>Id.</em>, at 403.  Once there, the officer could pursue traditional immunity defenses, <em>i.e.</em>, based on the facts as alleged by the plaintiff or as they survived summary judgment; that is all the Court could have meant when it said that officers \xe2\x80\x9cshould have the opportunity to present their version of the facts to a federal, not a state, court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 409.  Moreover, in <em>Mesa</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/121/index.html">489 U. S. 121</a>, 139 (1989), this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal officer removal under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a) must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.\xe2\x80\x9d    Because the federal employee defendants in <em>Mesa</em> \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not and could not present an official immunity defense\xe2\x80\x9d to the charges against them, removal was improper under \xc2\xa71442(a)(1).  <em>Id.</em>, at 133.  The majority reads the Westfall Act much more broadly than this Court read \xc2\xa71442(a) in <em>Mesa</em>, permitting removal in cases where there is unquestionably no official immunity defense available (at least as such defenses have been understood by this Court until today).  And in so doing, the majority opens wide the door not just to removal, which was all that was at issue in <em>Willingham</em> and <em>Mesa</em>, but, much more consequentially, to substituting a judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding for a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s jury trial right.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not claim that my own reading of the Westfall Act will totally eliminate the difficulties I have mentioned.  But an interpretation that reads the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language more literally will minimize them, while also largely mitigating the problem of clever pleading with which the majority is rightly concerned, <em>ante</em>, at 20.  The Act says the \xe2\x80\x9cAttorney General\xe2\x80\x9d must certify that the \xe2\x80\x9cemployee was acting within the scope of his office or employment <em>at the time of the incident </em>out of which the claim arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(d)(2) (emphasis added).  As I have said, that language prevents the Attorney General from denying that any \xe2\x80\x9cincident\xe2\x80\x9d at all occurred without at least adding in the alternative that any incident the plaintiff might be able to show falls within the employee\xe2\x80\x99s scope of employment regardless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, if a plaintiff claims an <em>intentional</em> touching (outside the scope of employment), the Attorney General is free to claim (a) there was no touching but (b) were the evidence to show a touching, it was accidental (within the scope of employment).  Yet if the plaintiff accuses the employee, a Yellowstone Park ranger, of negligent driving on Coney Island, the Attorney General could not make a similar claim. (Nor could he likely do so in respect to an employee whom the plaintiff claims committed a serious sexual assault.)  That is because if these latter incidents did happen, they must have fallen outside the scope of employment, while if they did not happen, then <em>nothing </em>involving the employee happened at all.  In such cases no Westfall Act immunity would be available.  And that is just as it should be.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach resembles, but differs in important respects from that of the First Circuit in <em>Wood</em>.  In <em>Wood</em>, the First Circuit held that a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate could resolve factual conflicts as to \xe2\x80\x9cincident-describing and incident-characterizing facts,\xe2\x80\x9d but must leave for the jury (if it came to that) disputes over whether any incident occurred at all.  995 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1129.  Here, I offer a compromise between <em>Wood</em> and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s more extreme approach.  I would permit a judge reviewing a Westfall Act certificate to resolve <em>any</em> factual disputes relevant to whether the defendant was \xe2\x80\x9cacting within the scope of his office or employment,\xe2\x80\x9d including, when necessary, determining whether the incident occurred at all.  But I would only permit the judge to fulfill this factfinding function in those cases where the Attorney General (or the defendant employee, under \xc2\xa72679(d)(3)) can offer <em>some</em> plausible explanation of the alleged incident that would bring the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions within the scope of his federal office or employment. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, absent some undefined constraint that might be imposed in future cases, <em>ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa014, would permit factfinding by a judge (and, where the Attorney General requests, removal to federal court) in <em>any</em> state-law tort case involving a federal employee.  I would permit judges to fulfill this rather extraordinary factfinding function only in those cases where the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury or loss of property, or personal injury or death\xe2\x80\x9d for which the plaintiff seeks recovery <em>might</em> have \xe2\x80\x9caris[en] or result[ed] from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of [the federal employee] while acting within the scope of his office or employment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, where there is <em>some chance</em> the injury (if any) was caused by the kinds of actions for which the Act expressly grants employees immunity, under \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).  This approach protects the innocent employee as well as the guilty, <em>ante</em>, at 20, but only in the class of law suits the Act can plausibly be read to cover.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act as does the Court, I would vacate its judgment.  I would, however, permit the Court of Appeals to consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative assertion of immunity (including whether it was properly barred by the trial court), and to determine whether Westfall Act immunity applies on that basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I dissent from Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
