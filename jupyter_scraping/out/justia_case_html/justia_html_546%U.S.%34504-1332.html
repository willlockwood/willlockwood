HALLOCK et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x931332.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 28, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 18, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">In a warranted search of Susan and Richard Hallocks\xe2\x80\x99 residence, Customs Service agents seized computer equipment, software, and disk drives.  No criminal charges were ever brought, but the equipment was returned damaged, with all of the stored data lost, forcing Susan to close her computer software business.  She sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346, and alleging negligence by the customs agents in executing the search.  While that suit was pending, Susan also filed this action against the individual agents under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, alleging that the damage they caused to her computers deprived her of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  After the District Court dismissed the first suit on the ground that the agents\xe2\x80\x99 activities fell within an exception to the Tort Claims Act\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity, \xc2\xa72680(e), the agents moved for judgment in the <em>Bivens </em>action.  They relied on the Tort Claims Act\xe2\x80\x99s judgment bar, \xc2\xa72676, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment in an action under 1346(b) \xe2\x80\xa6 constitute[s] a complete bar to any action \xe2\x80\xa6 against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the Tort Claims Act suit against the Government failed to raise the Act\xe2\x80\x99s judgment bar.  The Second Circuit affirmed, after first ruling in favor of jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.  Under this doctrine, appellate authority to review \xe2\x80\x9call final decisions of the district courts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71291, includes jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d but are sufficiently important and collateral to the merits that they should \xe2\x80\x9cnonetheless be treated as \xe2\x80\x98final,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Digital Equipment Corp.</em> v. <em>Desktop Direct, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/863/index.html">511 U.

S. 139</a>, 144.  Those conditions are \xe2\x80\x9cstringent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Digital Equipment, supra, </em>at 868.  Unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests \xc2\xa71291 is meant to further.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Among the \xe2\x80\x9csmall class\xe2\x80\x9d of orders this Court has held to be collaterally appealable are those rejecting absolute immunity, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/731/index.html">457 U. S. 731</a>, 742, qualified immunity, <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 530, and a State\xe2\x80\x99s Eleventh Amendment immunity claim, <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, </em>at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.  In each of these cases, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was immediately appealable the right would be effectively lost.  However, to accept the generalization that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition would leave \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x99s final order requirement in tatters.  See <em>Digital Equipment, supra, </em>at 872\xe2\x80\x93873.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Thus, only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify as orders that cannot be reviewed \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d after a conventional final judgment.  The further characteristic that merits collateral appealability is \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of the final judgment requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Digital Equipment, supra, </em>at 878\xe2\x80\x93879.  In each case finding appealability, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial, <em>e.g.,</em> honoring the separation of powers, <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 749, 758, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>at 526, and respecting a State\xe2\x80\x99s dignitary interests, <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, </em>at 146.  It is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest that counts.  <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</em> v. <em>Livesay,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/463/index.html">437 U. S. 463</a>, 468.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The customs agents\xe2\x80\x99 claim here does not serve a weighty public objective.  This case must be distinguished from qualified immunity cases.  The nub of such immunity is the need to induce government officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 817; a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.  There is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable.  It is the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to government employees were important enough, \xc2\xa71291 would fade out whenever the government or an official lost in an early round.  Another difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bar\xe2\x80\x99s essential procedural element.  While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The closer analogy to the judgment bar is the defense of res judicata.  Both are grounded in the perceived need to avoid duplicative litigation, not in a policy of freeing a defendant from any liability.  But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so important that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them.

S. 863</a>, 867 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The issue here is whether a refusal to apply the judgment bar of the Federal Tort Claims Act is open to collateral appeal.  We hold it is not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The complaint alleges that Susan Hallock owned a computer software business that she and her husband, Richard, operated from home.  After information about Richard Hallock\xe2\x80\x99s credit card was stolen and used to pay the subscription fee for a child pornography Web site, agents of the United States Customs Service, investigating the Web site, traced the payment to Richard Hallock\xe2\x80\x99s card and got a warrant to search the Hallocks\xe2\x80\x99 residence.  With that authority, they seized the Hallocks\xe2\x80\x99 computer equipment, software, and disk drives.  No criminal charges were ever brought, but the Government\xe2\x80\x99s actions produced a different disaster.  When the computer equipment was returned, several of the disk drives were damaged, all of the stored data (including trade secrets and account files) were lost, and the Hallocks were forced out of business.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 2002, Susan Hallock and her company brought an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346, and alleging negligence by the customs agents in executing the search.  The merits of the claim were never addressed, for the District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, holding that the agents\xe2\x80\x99 activities occurred in the course of detaining goods and thus fell within an exception to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity, \xc2\xa72680(e).  <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>United States, </em>253 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 361 (NDNY 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the suit against the Government was still pending, Susan Hallock filed this action against the individual agents under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), alleging in her complaint that the agents had damaged her computers and thus deprived her of property including business income in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  After the District Court dismissed the first suit against the Government, the agents moved for judgment in the <em>Bivens </em>action, citing the judgment bar of the Tort Claims Act, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment in an action under 1346(b) of this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72676.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the action against the Government under the Tort Claims Act was solely on a procedural ground, and thus failed to raise the judgment bar.  <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>281 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 425, 427 (NDNY 2003).  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, after first finding jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.  <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>387 F.\xc2\xa03d 147 (2004).  We granted certiorari to consider the judgment bar, 545 U.

S. 299</a>, 305 (1996), the collateral order doctrine accommodates a \xe2\x80\x9csmall class\xe2\x80\x9d of rulings, not concluding the litigation, but conclusively resolving \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  The claims are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cohen, supra, </em>at 546. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions: that an order \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority</em> v. <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/139/index.html"></a><a href="/us/506/139/index.html">506 U.

The conditions are \xe2\x80\x9cstringent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Digital Equipment, supra, </em>at 868 (citing <em>Midland Asphalt Corp.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/794/index.html">489 U. S. 794</a>, 799 (1989)), and unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests \xc2\xa71291 is meant to further: judicial efficiency, for example, and the \xe2\x80\x9csensible policy \xe2\x80\x98of avoid[ing] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Risjord,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/368/index.html">449 U.

S. 323</a>, 325 (1940)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Digital Equipment, </em>511 U. S., at 868 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98narrow\xe2\x80\x99 exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  And we have meant what we have said; although the Court has been asked many times to expand the \xe2\x80\x9csmall class\xe2\x80\x9d of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior cases mark the line between rulings within the class and those outside.  On the immediately appealable side are orders rejecting absolute immunity, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/731/index.html">457 U. S. 731</a>, 742 (1982), and qualified immunity, <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 530 (1985).  A State has the benefit of the doctrine to appeal a decision denying its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, </em>at 144\xe2\x80\x93145, and a criminal defendant may collaterally appeal an adverse ruling on a defense of double jeopardy, <em>Abney</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/651/index.html">431 U. S. 651</a>, 660 (1977).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The examples admittedly raise the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s temptation to generalize.  In each case, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was immediately appealable, the right would be effectively lost.  Those seeking immediate appeal therefore naturally argue that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition.  But this generalization is too easy to be sound and, if accepted, would leave the final order requirement of \xc2\xa71291 in tatters.  We faced this prospect in <em>Digital Equipment, supra, </em>an appeal from an order rescinding a settlement agreement.  Petitioner asserted a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right not to stand trial\xe2\x80\x99 requiring protection by way of immediate appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d analogizing the rescission to a denial of immunity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 869.  We said no, however, lest \xe2\x80\x9cevery right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal [be] loosely . . . described as conferring a \xe2\x80\x98right not to stand trial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 873.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9calmost every pretrial or trial order might be called \xe2\x80\x98effectively unreviewable\xe2\x80\x99 in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 872.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAllowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move \xc2\xa71291 aside for claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, that the statute of limitations has run, that the movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, that an action is barred on claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim.  Such motions can be made in virtually every case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 873 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify, then, as orders that cannot be reviewed \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d after a conventional final judgment, the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under <em>Cohen; </em>and as <em>Digital Equipment </em>explained, that something further boils down to \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 878\xe2\x80\x93879 (citing <em>Van Cauwenberghe</em> v. <em>Biard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/517/index.html">486 U. S. 517</a>, 524 (1988)).

In explaining collateral order treatment when a qualified immunity claim was at issue in <em>Mitchell,</em> <em>supra, </em>we spoke of the threatened disruption of governmental functions, and fear of inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in public service if a full trial were threatened whenever they acted reasonably in the face of law that is not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 526.  <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/506/139/index.html"></a><a href="/us/506/139/index.html">506 U.

And although the double jeopardy claim given <em>Cohen </em>treatment in <em>Abney,</em> <em>supra, </em>did not implicate a right to be free of all proceedings whatsoever (since prior jeopardy is essential to the defense), we described the enormous prosecutorial power of the Government to subject an individual \xe2\x80\x9cto embarrassment, expense and ordeal \xe2\x80\xa6 compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 661\xe2\x80\x93662 (internal quotation marks omitted); the only way to alleviate these consequences of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s superior position was by collateral order appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In each case, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial: honoring the separation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, respecting a State\xe2\x80\x99s dignitary interests, and mitigating the government\xe2\x80\x99s advantage over the individual.  That is, it is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest, that counts when asking whether an order is \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d unreviewable if review is to be left until later.  <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</em> 437 U.

One can argue, of course, that if the <em>Bivens </em>action goes to trial the efficiency of Government will be compromised and the officials burdened and distracted, as in the qualified immunity case: if qualified immunity gets <em>Cohen </em>treatment, so should the judgment bar to further litigation in the aftermath of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s success under the Tort Claims Act.  But the cases are different.  Qualified immunity is not the law simply to save trouble for the Government and its employees; it is recognized because the burden of trial is unjustified in the face of a colorable claim that the law on point was not clear when the official took action, and the action was reasonable in light of the law as it was.  The nub of qualified immunity is the need to induce officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 818 (1982); see also <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 202 (2001); a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable.  It is not the preservation of initiative but the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the judgment bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to Government employees were important enough for <em>Cohen </em>treatment, collateral order appeal would be a matter of right whenever the government lost a motion to dismiss under the Tort Claims Act, or a federal officer lost one on a <em>Bivens</em> action<em>, </em>or a state official was in that position in a case under 42  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, or <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/index.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908).  In effect, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291 would fade out whenever the government or an official lost an early round that could have stopped the fight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bar\xe2\x80\x99s essential procedural element.  While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  If a <em>Bivens </em>action alone is brought, there will be no possibility of a judgment bar, nor will there be so long as a <em>Bivens </em>action against officials and a Tort Claims Act against the Government are pending simultaneously (as they were for a time here).  In the present case, if Susan Hallock had brought her <em>Bivens </em>action and no other, the agents could not possibly have invoked the judgment bar in claiming a right to be free of trial.  The closer analogy to the judgment bar, then, is not immunity but the defense of claim preclusion, or res judicata.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the statutory judgment bar is arguably broader than traditional res judicata, it functions in much the same way, with both rules depending on a prior judgment as a condition precedent*<footcall num="*"> and neither reflecting a policy that a defendant should be scot free of any liability.  The concern behind both rules is a different one, of avoiding duplicative litigation, \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple suits on identical entitlements or obligations between the same parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74402, p.\xc2\xa09 (2d ed. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).<font super="1">  But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so great that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them.  As we indicated in <em>Digital Equipment</em>, in the usual case, absent particular reasons for discretionary appeal by leave of the trial court, a defense of claim preclusion is fairly subordinated to the general policy of deferring appellate review to the moment of final judgment.  511 U.
