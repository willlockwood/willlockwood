S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77201 is \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a tax deficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sansone</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/343/index.html">380 U. S. 343</a>, 351.  Petitioner Boulware was charged with criminal tax evasion and filing a false income tax return for diverting funds from a closely held corporation, HIE, of which he was the president, founder, and controlling shareholder.  To support his argument that the Government could not establish the tax deficiency required to convict him, Boulware sought to introduce evidence that HIE had no earnings and profits in the relevant taxable years, so he in effect received distributions of property that were returns of capital, up to his basis in his stock, which are not taxable, see 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a).  Under \xc2\xa7301(a), unless the Internal Revenue Code requires otherwise, a \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution of property\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmade by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock shall be treated in the manner provided in [\xc2\xa7301(c)].\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 301(c) provides that the portion of the distribution that is a \xe2\x80\x9cdividend,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by \xc2\xa7316(a), must be included in the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s gross income; and the portion that is not a dividend is, depending on the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s basis for his stock, either a nontaxable return of capital or a taxable capital gain.  Section 316(a) defines \xe2\x80\x9cdividend\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution\xe2\x80\x9d out of \xe2\x80\x9cearnings and profits.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s <em>in limine</em> motion to bar evidence supporting Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s return-of-capital theory, relying on the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miller </em>decision that a diversion of funds in a criminal tax evasion case may be deemed a return of capital only if the taxpayer or corporation demonstrates that the distributions were intended to be such a return.  The court later found Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of evidence insufficient under <em>Miller </em>and declined to instruct the jury on his theory.  In affirming his conviction, the Ninth Circuit held that Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s proffer was properly rejected under <em>Miller </em>because he offered no proof that the amounts diverted were intended as a return of capital when they were made.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A distributee accused of criminal tax evasion may claim return-of-capital treatment without producing evidence that, when the distribution occurred, either he or the corporation intended a return of capital.

S. 561</a>, 573.  In economic reality, a shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s informal receipt of corporate property  \xe2\x80\x9cmay be as effective a means of distributing profits among stockholders as the formal declaration of a dividend,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Palmer</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/63/index.html">302 U. S. 63</a>, 69, or as effective a means of returning a shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s capital, see <em>ibid</em>.  Economic substance remains the touchstone for characterizing funds that a shareholder diverts before they can be recorded on a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s books.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s view that a return-of-capital defense requires evidence of a corresponding contemporaneous intent sits uncomfortably not only with the tax law\xe2\x80\x99s economic realism, but also with the particular wording of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a).  As these sections are written, the tax consequences of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s distribution made with respect to stock depend, not on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to return capital or get it back, but on facts wholly independent of intent: whether the corporation had earnings and profits, and the amount of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s basis for his stock.  The <em>Miller</em> court could claim no textual hook for its contemporaneous intent requirement, but argued that it avoided supposed anomalies.  The court, however, mistakenly reasoned that applying \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) in criminal cases unnecessarily emphasizes the deficiency\xe2\x80\x99s amount while ignoring the willfulness of the intent to evade taxes.  Willfulness is an element of the crimes because the substantive provisions defining tax evasion and filing a false return expressly require it, see, <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa77201.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) relieves the Government of the burden of proving willfulness or impedes it from doing so if there is evidence of willfulness.  The <em>Miller</em> court also erred in finding it troublesome that, without a contemporaneous intent requirement, a shareholder distributee would be immune from punishment if the corporation had no earnings and profits but convicted if the corporation did have earning and profits.  An acquittal in the former instance would in fact result merely from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to prove an element of the crime.  The fact that a shareholder of a successful corporation may have different tax liability from a shareholder of a corporation without earnings and profits merely follows from the way \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) are written and from \xc2\xa77201\xe2\x80\x99s tax deficiency requirement.  Even if there were compelling reasons to extend \xc2\xa77201 to cases in which no taxes are owed, Congress, not the Judiciary, would have to do the rewriting.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Miller</em> also suffers from its own anomalies.  First, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316 are odd stalks for grafting a contemporaneous intent requirement.  Correct application of their rules will often become possible only at the end of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s tax year, regardless of the shareholder or corporation\xe2\x80\x99s understanding months earlier when a particular distribution may have been made.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7301(a), which expressly provides that distributions made with respect to stock \xe2\x80\x9cshall be treated in the manner provided in [\xc2\xa7301(c)],\xe2\x80\x9d ostensibly provides for all variations of tax treatment of such distributions unless a separate Code provision requires otherwise.  Yet <em>Miller</em> effectively converts the section into one of merely partial coverage, leaving the tax status of one class of distributions in limbo in criminal cases.  Allowing \xc2\xa761(a) of the Code, which defines gross income, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9call income from whatever source derived,\xe2\x80\x9d to step in where \xc2\xa7301(a) has been pushed aside would sanction yet another eccentricity: \xc2\xa7301(a) would not cover what it says it \xe2\x80\x9cshall,\xe2\x80\x9d (distributions with respect to stock for which no more specific provision is made), while \xc2\xa761(a) would have to apply to what by its terms it should not (a receipt of funds for which tax treatment is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7301(a)). <em>Miller</em> erred in requiring contemporaneous intent, and the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment here, relying on <em>Miller</em>, is likewise erroneous.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0This Court declines to address the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that before any distribution may be treated as a return of capital, it must first be distributed to the shareholder \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 stock.\xe2\x80\x9d  The facts in this case have not been raked over with that condition in mind, and any canvas of evidence and Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s proffer should be made by a court familiar with the entire evidentiary record.  Nor will the Court take up in the first instance the question whether an unlawful diversion may ever be deemed a \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to [a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s] stock.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">470 F.\xc2\xa03d 931, vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962538">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF THE COURT<br/>\nBOULWARE V.

At trial,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the United States sought to establish that Boulware had received taxable income by \xe2\x80\x9csystematically divert[ing] funds from HIE in order to support a lavish lifestyle.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 F.\xc2\xa03d 794, 799 (CA9 2004).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence showed that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Boulware] gave millions of dollars of HIE money to his girlfriend \xe2\x80\xa6 and millions of dollars to his wife \xe2\x80\xa6 without reporting any of this money on his personal income tax returns. . . . [H]e siphoned off this money primarily by writing checks to employees and friends and having them return the cash to him, by diverting payments by HIE customers, by submitting fraudulent invoices to HIE, and by laundering HIE money through companies in the Kingdom of Tonga and Hong Kong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn defense, Boulware sought to introduce evidence that HIE had no retained or current earnings and profits in the relevant taxable years, with the consequence (he argued) that he in effect received distributions of property that must have been returns of capital, up to his basis in his stock.  See \xc2\xa7301(c)(2).  Because the return of capital was nontaxable, the argument went, the Government could not establish the tax deficiency required to convict him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government moved <em>in limine</em> to bar evidence in support of Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s return-of-capital theory, on the grounds of \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevan[ce] in [this] criminal tax case,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 20.  The Government relied on the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, 545 F.\xc2\xa02d 1204 (1976), in which that court held that in a criminal tax evasion case, a diversion of funds may be deemed a return of capital only after \xe2\x80\x9csome demonstration on the part of the taxpayer and/or the corporation that such [a distribution was] intended to be such a return,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1215.  Boulware, the Government argued, had offered to make no such demonstration.  App. 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion, and when Boulware sought \xe2\x80\x9cto present evidence of [HIE\xe2\x80\x99s] alleged over-reporting of income, and an offer of proof relating to the issue of \xe2\x80\xa6 dividends,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 135, the District Court denied his request.  The court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot only would much of [his proffered] evidence be excludable as expert legal opinion, it is plainly insufficient under the Miller case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 138, and accordingly declined to instruct the jury on Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s return-of-capital theory.  The jury rejected his alternative defenses (that the diverted funds were nontaxable corporate advances or loans, or that he used the moneys for corporate purposes), and found him guilty on nine counts, four of tax evasion and five of filing a false return.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  470 F.\xc2\xa03d 931 (2006).  It acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cimposing an intent requirement creates a disconnect between civil and criminal liability,\xe2\x80\x9d but thought that under <em>Miller</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe characterization of diverted corporate funds for civil tax purposes does not dictate their characterization for purposes of a criminal tax evasion charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 934.  The court held the test in a criminal case to be \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the defendant has willfully attempted to evade the payment or assessment of a tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because Boulware \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98presented no concrete proof that the amounts were considered, intended, or recorded on the corporate records as a return of capital at the time they were made,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 935 (quoting <em>Miller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1215), the Ninth Circuit held that Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s proffer was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly rejected \xe2\x80\xa6 as inadequate,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Thomas concurred because the panel was bound by <em>Miller</em>, but noted that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x94and now the majority opinion\xe2\x80\x94hold that a defendant may be criminally sanctioned for tax evasion without owing a penny in taxes to the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 938.  That, he said, not only \xe2\x80\x9cindicate[s] a logical fallacy, but is in flat contradiction with the tax evasion statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement \xe2\x80\xa6 of a tax deficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

As those sections are written, the tax consequences of a \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution by a corporation with respect to its stock\xe2\x80\x9d depend, not on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to return capital or to get it back, but on facts wholly independent of intent: whether the corporation had earnings and profits, and the amount of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s basis for his stock.  Cf. <em>Truesdell</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Action on Decision 1988\xe2\x80\x9325, 1988 WL 570761 (Sept. 12, 1988) (recommendation regarding acquiescence); IRS Non Docketed Service Advice Review, 1989 WL 1172952 (Mar. 15, 1989) (reply to request for reconsideration) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ntent is irrelevant. . . . [E]very distribution made with respect to a shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s stock is taxable as ordinary income, capital gain, or not at all pursuant to section 301(c) dependent upon the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s earnings and profits and the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s stock basis.  The determination is computational and not dependent upon intent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the <em>Miller</em> court went the other way, needless to say, it could claim no textual hook for the contemporaneous intent requirement, but argued for it as the way to avoid two supposed anomalies.  First, the court thought that applying \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) in criminal cases unnecessarily emphasizes the exact amount of deficiency while \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely ignor[ing] one essential element of the crime charged: the willful intent to evade taxes . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  545 F. 2d, at 1214.  But there is an analytical mistake here.  Willfulness is an element of the crimes charged because the substantive provisions defining tax evasion and filing a false return expressly require it, see \xc2\xa77201 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny person who willfully attempts . . . \xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa77206(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cWillfully makes and subscribes . . . \xe2\x80\x9d).  The element of willfulness is addressed at trial by requiring the Government to prove it.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) as written (that is, without an intent requirement) relieves the Government of this burden of proving willfulness or impedes it from doing so if evidence of willfulness is there.  Those two sections as written simply address a different element of criminal evasion, the existence of a tax deficiency, and both deficiency and willfulness can be addressed straightforwardly (in jury instructions or bench findings) without tacking an intent requirement onto the rule distinguishing dividends from capital returns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the <em>Miller</em> court worried that if a defendant could claim capital treatment without showing a corresponding and contemporaneous intent,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a] taxpayer who diverted funds from his close corporation when it was in the midst of a financial difficulty and had no earnings and profits would be immune from punishment (to the extent of his basis in the stock) for failure to report such sums as income; while that very same taxpayer would be convicted if the corporation had experienced a successful year and had earnings and profits.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 F. 2d, at 1214.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a result,\xe2\x80\x9d said the court, \xe2\x80\x9cwould constitute an extreme example of form over substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Circuit thus assumed that a taxpayer like Boulware could be convicted of evasion with no showing of deficiency from an unreported dividend or capital gain.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the acquittal that the author of <em>Miller</em> called form trumping substance would in fact result from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to prove an element of the crime.  There is no criminal tax evasion without a tax deficiency, see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and there is no deficiency owing to a distribution (received with respect to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s stock) if a corporation has no earnings and profits and the value distributed does not exceed the taxpayer-shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s basis for his stock.  Thus the fact that a shareholder distributee of a successful corporation may have different tax liability from a shareholder of a corporation without earnings and profits merely follows from the way \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) are written (to distinguish dividend from capital return), and from the requirement of tax deficiency for a \xc2\xa77201 crime.  Without the deficiency there is nothing but some act expressing the will to evade, and, under \xc2\xa77201, acting on \xe2\x80\x9cbad intentions, alone, [is] not punishable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>D\xe2\x80\x99Agostino</em>, 145 F.\xc2\xa03d 69, 73 (CA2 1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is neither here nor there whether the <em>Miller</em> court was justified in thinking it would improve things to convict more of the evasively inclined by dropping the deficiency requirement and finding some other device to exempt returns of capital.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Even if there were compelling reasons to extend \xc2\xa77201 to cases in which no taxes are owed, it bears repeating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he spirit of the doctrine which denies to the federal judiciary power to create crimes forthrightly admonishes that we should not enlarge the reach of enacted crimes by constituting them from anything less than the incriminating components contemplated by the words used in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/246/index.html">342 U. S. 246</a>, 263 (1952) (opinion for the Court by Jackson, J.).  If \xc2\xa7301, \xc2\xa7316(a), or \xc2\xa77201 could stand amending, Congress will have to do the rewriting.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only is <em>Miller</em> devoid of the support claimed for it, but it suffers the demerit of some anomalies of its own.  First and most obviously, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316 are odd stalks for grafting a contemporaneous intent requirement, given the fact that the correct application of their rules will often become known only at the end of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s tax year, regardless of the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s or corporation\xe2\x80\x99s understanding months earlier when a particular distribution may have been made.  Section 316(a)(2) conditions treating a distribution as a constructive dividend by reference to earnings and profits, and earnings and profits are to be \xe2\x80\x9ccomputed as of the close of the taxable year \xe2\x80\xa6 without regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  A corporation may make a deliberate distribution to a shareholder, with everyone expecting a profitable year and considering the distribution to be a dividend, only to have the shareholder end up liable for no tax if the company closes out its tax year\nin the red (so long as the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s basis covers the distribution); when such facts are clear at the time the reporting forms and returns are filed,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the shareholder does not violate \xc2\xa77201 by paying no tax on the moneys received, intent being beside the point.  And since intent to make a distribution a taxable one cannot control, it would be odd to condition nontaxable return-of-capital treatment on contemporaneous intent, when the statute says nothing about intent at all.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The intent interpretation is strange for another reason, too (a reason in some tension with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that an unreported distribution without contemporaneous intent to return capital will support a conviction for evasion).  The text of \xc2\xa7301(a) ostensibly provides for all variations of tax treatment of distributions received with respect to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s stock unless a separate provision of the Code requires otherwise.  Yet <em>Miller</em> effectively converts the section into one of merely partial coverage, with the result of leaving one class of distributions in a tax status limbo in criminal cases.  That is, while \xc2\xa7301(a) expressly provides that distributions made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock \xe2\x80\x9cshall be treated in the manner provided in [\xc2\xa7301(c)],\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Miller</em>, a distribution from a corporation without earnings and profits would fail to be a return of capital for lack of contemporaneous intent to treat it that way; but to the extent that distribution did not exceed the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s basis for the stock (and thus become a capital gain), \xc2\xa7301(a) would leave the distribution unaccounted for.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer to say that \xc2\xa761(a) of the Code would step in where \xc2\xa7301(a) has been pushed out.  Although \xc2\xa761(a) defines gross income, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9call income from whatever source derived,\xe2\x80\x9d the plain text of \xc2\xa7301(a) does provide otherwise for distributions made with respect to stock.  So using \xc2\xa761(a) as a stopgap would only sanction yet another eccentricity: \xc2\xa7301(a) would be held not to cover what its text says it \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d (the class of distributions made with respect to stock for which no other more specific provision is made), while \xc2\xa761(a) would need to be applied to what by its terms it should not be (a receipt of funds for which tax treatment is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7301(a)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The implausibility of a statutory reading that either creates a tax limbo or forces resort to an atextual stopgap is all the clearer from the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s discussion in this case of its own understanding of the consequences of <em>Miller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule: the court openly acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cimposing an intent requirement creates a disconnect between civil and criminal liability,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 934.  In construing distribution rules that draw no distinction in terms of criminal or civil consequences, the disparity of treatment assumed by the Court of Appeals counts heavily against its contemporaneous intent construction (quite apart from the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that its interpretation entails criminal liability for evasion without any showing of a tax deficiency).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miller</em> erred in requiring a contemporaneous intent to treat the receipt of corporate funds as a return of capital, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals here, relying on <em>Miller</em>, is likewise erroneous.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has raised nothing that calls for affirmance in the face of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Miller</em>.  The United States does not defend differential treatment of criminal and civil cases, see Brief for United States 24, and it thus stops short of fully defending the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s treatment.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, instead, is that we should affirm under the rule that before any distribution may be treated as a return of capital (or, by a parity of reasoning, a dividend), it must first be distributed to the shareholder \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to . . . stock.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 19 (internal quotations omitted).  The taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s intent, the Government says, may be relevant to this limiting condition, and Boulware never expressly claimed any such intent.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ntent is \xe2\x80\xa6 relevant to whether a payment is a \xe2\x80\x98distribution \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to [a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s] stock\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); but see Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (\xe2\x80\x9c[J]ust to be clear, the Government is arguing for an objective test here\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government is of course correct that \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 stock\xe2\x80\x9d is a limiting condition in \xc2\xa7301(a).  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  As the Government variously says, it requires that \xe2\x80\x9cthe distribution of property by the corporation be made to a shareholder because of his ownership of its stock,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 16; and that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an amount paid by a corporation to a shareholder [be] paid to the shareholder in his capacity as such,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.301\xe2\x80\x931(c) (2007) (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This, however, is not the time or place to home in on the \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 stock\xe2\x80\x9d condition.  Facts with a bearing on it may range from the distribution of stock ownership[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] to conditions of corporate employment (whether, for example, a shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on behalf of a corporation amount to a good reason to treat a payment of property as salary).  The facts in this case have yet to be raked over with the stock ownership condition in mind, since <em>Miller</em> seems to have pretermitted a full consideration of the defensive proffer, and if consideration is to be given to that condition now, the canvas of evidence and Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s proffer should be made by a court familiar with the whole evidentiary record.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a more specific version of its \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to . . . stock\xe2\x80\x9d position, the Government says that the diversions of corporate funds to Boulware were in fact unlawful, see Brief for United States 34\xe2\x80\x9337; see also n.\xc2\xa05, <em>supra</em>, and it argues that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) are inapplicable to illegal transfers, see Brief for United States 34\xe2\x80\x9337; see also <em>D\xe2\x80\x99Agostino</em>, 145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 73 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98no earnings and profits, no income\xe2\x80\x99 rule would not necessarily apply in a case of <em>unlawful</em> diversion, such as embezzlement, theft, a violation of corporate law, or an attempt to defraud third party creditors\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)); see also n.\xc2\xa08, <em>supra</em>.  The Government goes so far as to claim that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only rational basis for the jury\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was a conclusion that [Boulware] unlawfully diverted the funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 37.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we decline to take up the question whether an unlawful diversion may ever be deemed a \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution . . . with respect to [a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s] stock,\xe2\x80\x9d a question which was not considered by the Ninth Circuit.  We do, however, reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current characterization of the jury verdict in Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s case.  True, the jurors were not moved by Boulware\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the diversions were corporate advances or loans, or that he was using the funds for corporate purposes.  But the jury was not asked, and cannot be said to have answered, whether Boulware breached any fiduciary duty as a controlling shareholder, unlawfully diverted corporate funds to defraud his wife, or embezzled HIE\xe2\x80\x99s funds outright.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sections \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301 and 316(a) govern the tax consequences of constructive distributions made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock.
