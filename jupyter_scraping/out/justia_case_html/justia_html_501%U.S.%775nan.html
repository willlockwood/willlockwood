The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that immunity did not extend to suits by Indian tribes, and Alaska seeks review of that determination.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1980, Alaska enacted a revenue-sharing statute that provided annual payments of $25,000 to each "Native village government" located in a community without a state-chartered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="778">Page 501 U. S. 778</a></p><p> municipal corporation.  Alaska Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 29.89.050 (1984).  The State\'s attorney general believed the statute to be unconstitutional.  In his view, Native village governments were "racially exclusive groups" or "racially exclusive organizations" whose status turned exclusively on the racial ancestry of their members; therefore, the attorney general believed, funding these groups would violate the equal protection clause of Alaska\'s Constitution.  Acting on the attorney general\'s advice, the Commissioner of Alaska\'s Department of Community and Regional Affairs (petitioner here), enlarged the program to include all unincorporated communities, whether administered by Native governments or not.  Shortly thereafter, the legislature increased funding under the program to match its increased scope.  Funding, however, never reached the full $25,000 initially allocated to each unincorporated Native community.</p>\n<p>The legislature repealed the revenue-sharing statute in 1985, <em>see</em> 1985 Alaska Sess.Laws, ch. 90, and replaced it with one that matched the program as expanded by the commissioner.  In the same year, respondents filed this suit, challenging the commissioner\'s action on federal equal protection grounds, and seeking an order requiring the commissioner to pay them the money that they would have received had the commissioner not enlarged the program.  The District Court initially granted an injunction to preserve sufficient funds for the 1986 fiscal year, but then dismissed the suit as violating the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, first on the ground that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362 constituted a congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>Native Village of Noatak v. Hoffman,</em> 872 F.2d 1384 (1989) (later withdrawn), and then, upon reconsideration, on the ground that Alaska had no immunity against suits by Indian tribes.  896 F.2d 1157 (1989).

And even if they did, respondents contend, the States have consented to suits by tribes in the "plan of the convention."  We consider these points in turn.</p>\n<p>In arguing that sovereign immunity does not restrict suit by Indian tribes, respondents submit, first, that sovereign </p><p><a class="page-number" name="780">Page 501 U. S. 780</a></p><p> immunity only restricts suits by individuals against sovereigns, not by sovereigns against sovereigns, and as we have recognized, <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\'n v.

Respondents\' conception of the nature of sovereign immunity finds some support both in the apparent understanding of the Founders and in dicta of our own opinions. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But whatever the reach or meaning of these early statements, the notion that traditional principles of sovereign immunity only restrict suits by individuals was rejected in <em>Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/case.html">292 U. S. 313</a></span> (1934).  It is with that opinion, and the conception of sovereignty that it embraces, that we must begin.</p>\n<p>In <em>Monaco,</em> the Principality had come into possession of Mississippi state bonds, and had sued Mississippi in federal court to recover amounts due under those bonds.  Mississippi defended on grounds of the Eleventh Amendment, among others.  Had respondents\' understanding of sovereign immunity been the Court\'s, the Eleventh Amendment would not have limited the otherwise clear grant of jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 501 U. S. 781</a></p><p> in Article III to hear controversies "between a State . . . and foreign States."  But we held that it did.</p>\n<p>"Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of \xc2\xa7 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against nonconsenting States.  Behind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control. . . .  There is . . . the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been a \'surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.\'  The Federalist, No. 81."</p>\n<p><em>Monaco, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/case.html#322">292 U. S. 322</a></span>-323 (footnote omitted).  Our clear assumption in <em>Monaco</em> was that sovereign immunity extends against both individuals and sovereigns, so that there must be found inherent in the plan of the convention a surrender by the States of immunity as to either.  Because we perceived in the plan "no ground upon which it can be said that any waiver or consent by a State of the Union has run in favor of a foreign State," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/case.html#330">292 U. S. 330</a></span>, we concluded that foreign states were still subject to the immunity of the States.</p>\n<p>We pursue the same inquiry in the present case, and thus confront respondents\' second contention:  that the States waived their immunity against Indian tribes when they adopted the Constitution.  Just as in <em>Monaco</em> with regard to foreign sovereigns, so also here with regard to Indian tribes, there is no compelling evidence that the Founders thought such a surrender inherent in the constitutional compact.

That is true in some respects:  they are, for example, domestic.  The relevant difference between States and foreign sovereigns, however, is not domesticity, but the role of each in the convention within which the surrender of immunity was for the former, but not for the latter, implicit.  What makes the States\' surrender of immunity from suit by sister States plausible is the mutuality of that concession.  There is no such mutuality with either foreign sovereigns or Indian tribes.  We have repeatedly held that Indian tribes enjoy immunity against suits by States, <em>Potawatomi Tribe, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/505/case.html#509">498 U. S. 509</a></span>, as it would be absurd to suggest that the tribes surrendered immunity in a convention to which they were not even parties.  But if the convention could not surrender the tribes\' immunity for the benefit of the States, we do not believe that it surrendered the States\' immunity for the benefit of the tribes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents argue that, if the Eleventh Amendment operates to bar suits by Indian tribes against States without their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 501 U. S. 783</a></p><p> consent, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362 operates to void that bar.  They press two very different arguments, which we consider in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Minnesota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/181/case.html">270 U. S. 181</a></span> (1926), we held that the United States had standing to sue on behalf of Indian tribes as guardians of the tribes\' rights, and that, since "the immunity of the State is subject to the constitutional qualification that she may be sued in this Court by the United States," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/181/case.html#195">270 U. S. 195</a></span>, no Eleventh Amendment bar would limit the United States\' access to federal courts for that purpose.  Relying upon our decision in <em>Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U. S. 463</a></span> (196), respondents argue that we have read \xc2\xa7 1362 to embody a general delegation of the authority to sue on the tribes\' behalf from the Federal Government back to tribes themselves.  Hence, respondents suggest, because the United States would face no sovereign immunity limitation, in no case brought under \xc2\xa7 1362 can sovereign immunity be a bar.  Section 1362 provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>What is striking about this most unremarkable statute is its similarity to any number of other grants of jurisdiction to district courts to hear federal question claims.  Compare it, for example, with \xc2\xa7 1331(a) as it existed at the time \xc2\xa7 1362 was enacted:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 501 U. S. 784</a></p><p> treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(a) (1964 ed.).  Considering the text of \xc2\xa7 1362 in the context of its enactment, one might well conclude that its <em>sole</em> purpose was to eliminate any jurisdictional minimum for "arising under" claims brought by Indian tribes.  Tribes already had access to federal courts for "arising under" claims under \xc2\xa7 1331, where the amount in controversy was greater than $10,000; for all that appears from its text, \xc2\xa7 1362 merely extends that jurisdiction to claims below that minimum.  Such a reading, moreover, finds support in the very title of the Act that adopted \xc2\xa7 1362:</p>\n<p>"To amend the Judicial Code to permit Indian tribes to maintain civil actions in Federal district courts without regard to the $10,000 limitation, and for other purposes."</p>\n<p>80 Stat. 880.</p>\n<p><em>Moe,</em> however, found something more in the title\'s "other purposes" -- an implication that</p>\n<p>"a tribe\'s access to federal court to litigate [federal question cases] would be <em>at least in some respects</em> as broad as that of the United States suing as the tribe\'s trustee,"</p>\n<p>425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#473">425 U. S. 473</a></span> (emphasis added).  The "respect" at issue in <em>Moe</em> was access to federal court for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief from state taxation.  The Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, denied such access to persons other than the United States; we held that \xc2\xa7 1362 revoked that denial as to Indian tribes.  <em>Moe</em> did not purport to be saying that \xc2\xa7 1362 equated tribal access with the United States\' access <em>generally,</em> but only "at least in some respects," 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#473">425 U. S. 473</a></span>, or "in certain respects," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#474">425 U. S. 474</a></span>.  Respondents now urge us, in effect, to eliminate this limitation utterly -- for it is impossible to imagine any more extreme replication of the United States\' ability to sue than replication even to the point of allowing unconsented suit against state sovereigns.  This is a vast expansion upon <em>Moe.</em>  Section 1341, which <em>Moe</em> held \xc2\xa7 1362 to eliminate in its application to tribal suits, was merely a limitation that Congress itself had created -- committing state tax injunction suits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 501 U. S. 785</a></p><p> to state courts as a matter of comity.  Absent that statute, state taxes could constitutionally be enjoined.  <em>See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html">491 U. S. 58</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#71">491 U. S. 71</a></span>, n. 10 (1989). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The obstacle to suit in the present case, by contrast, is a creation not of Congress, but of the Constitution.  A willingness to eliminate the former in no way bespeaks a willingness to eliminate the latter, especially when limitation to "certain respects" has explicitly been announced.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as we shall discuss in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/case.html#786">501 U. S. </a></span> our cases require Congress\' exercise of the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity, where it exists, to be exercised with unmistakeable clarity.  To avoid that difficulty, respondents assert that \xc2\xa7 1362 represents not an abrogation of the States\' sovereign immunity, but rather a <em>delegation</em> to tribes of the Federal Government\'s exemption from state sovereign immunity.  We doubt, to begin with, that that sovereign exemption can be delegated -- even if one limits the permissibility of delegation (as respondents propose) to persons on whose behalf the United States itself might sue.  The consent, "inherent in the convention," to suit by the United States -- at the instance and under the control of responsible federal officers -- is not consent to suit by anyone whom the United States might select; and even consent to suit by the United States for a particular person\'s benefit is not consent to suit by that person himself.</p>\n<p>But, in any event, assuming that delegation of exemption from state sovereign immunity is theoretically possible, there is no reason to believe that Congress ever contemplated such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 501 U. S. 786</a></p><p> a strange notion.  Even if our decision in <em>Moe</em> could be regarded as in any way related to sovereign immunity, <em>see</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra,</em> it could nevertheless not be regarded as in any way related to congressional "delegation."  The opinion does not mention that word, and contains not the slightest suggestion of such an analysis.  To say that</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 1362 . . . suggests that, in certain respects, tribes suing under this section were to be accorded treatment similar to that of the United States had it sued on their behalf,"</p>\n<p>425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#474">425 U. S. 474</a></span>, does not remotely imply delegation -- only equivalence of treatment.  The delegation theory is entirely a creature of respondents\' own invention.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, respondents ask us to recognize \xc2\xa7 1362 as a congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  We have repeatedly said that this power to abrogate can only be exercised by a clear legislative statement.  As we said in <em>Dellmuth v. Muth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html">491 U. S. 223</a></span> (1989),</p>\n<p>"To temper Congress\' acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment\'s role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test:"</p>\n<p>"Congress may abrogate the States\' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html#227">491 U. S. 227</a></span>-228.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that \xc2\xa7 1362 does not reflect an "unmistakably clear" intent to abrogate immunity, made plain "in the language of the statute."  As we have already noted, the text is no more specific than \xc2\xa7 1331, the grant of general federal question jurisdiction to district courts, and no one contends that \xc2\xa7 1331 suffices to abrogate immunity for all federal questions. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 501 U. S. 787</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents\' argument, however, is not that \xc2\xa7 1362 is a "clear statement" under the standard of <em>Dellmuth,</em> but rather that it was a sufficiently clear statement under the standard of <em>Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/184/case.html">377 U. S. 184</a></span> (1964), the existing authority for "abrogation" at the time of \xc2\xa7 1362\'s enactment in 1966.  In <em>Parden,</em> we found a sufficiently clear intent to avoid state immunity in a statute that subjected to liability "every" common carrier in interstate commerce, where the State, after the statute\'s enactment, chose to become a carrier in interstate commerce.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/184/case.html#187">377 U. S. 187</a></span>-188.  Similarly, respondents argue, a statute that grants jurisdiction to district courts to hear "all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe" should constitute a sufficiently clear expression of intent to abrogate immunity.  <em>Dellmuth</em> is not to the contrary, respondents maintain, since the statute there was enacted in the mid-1970\'s, long after the rule of <em>Parden</em> had been drawn into question.  <em>Dellmuth, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html#231">491 U. S. 231</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We shall assume for the sake of argument (though we by no means accept) that Congress must be presumed to have had as relatively obscure a decision as <em>Parden</em> in mind as a backdrop to all its legislation.  But even if Congress were aware of <em>Parden\'s</em> minimal clarity requirement, nothing in <em>Parden</em> could lead Congress to presume that that requirement applied to the <em>abrogation</em> of state immunity.  <em>Parden</em> itself neither mentioned nor was premised upon abrogation.  Its theory was that, by entering a field of economic activity that is federally regulated, the State impliedly "consent[s]" to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 501 U. S. 788</a></p><p> bound by that regulation and to be subject to suit in federal court on the same terms as other regulated parties, thus "waiv[ing]" its Eleventh Amendment immunity.  377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/184/case.html#186">377 U. S. 186</a></span>.  Not until 1976 (10 years after the passage of \xc2\xa7 1362) did we first acknowledge a congressional power to abrogate state immunity -- under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/case.html">427 U. S. 445</a></span> (1976).  Thus, <em>Parden</em> would have given Congress no reason to believe it could abrogate state sovereign immunity, and gives us no reason to believe that Congress intended abrogation by a means so subtle as \xc2\xa7 1362.  At the time \xc2\xa7 1362 was enacted, abrogation would have been regarded as such a novel (not to say questionable) course that a general "arising under" statute like \xc2\xa7 1362 would not conceivably have been thought to imply it.  We conclude that neither under the current standard of <em>Dellmuth</em> nor under any standard in effect at the time of <em>Parden</em> was \xc2\xa7 1362 an abrogation of state sovereign immunity. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Finally, respondents argue that, even if the Eleventh Amendment bars their claims for damages, they still seek injunctive relief, which the Eleventh Amendment would not bar.

We think not.

The majority rejects this argument, holding that \xc2\xa7 1362 cannot authorize respondents\' suit because the statute\'s language does not reflect an "unmistakably clear" intent to abrogate the States\' sovereign immunity.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/case.html#786">501 U.

I have never accepted the validity of that so-called "clear statement rule," and I remain of the view, expressed by Justice Brennan for four of us in <em>Atascadero,</em> that such</p>\n<p>"special rules of statutory drafting are not justified (nor are they justifiable) as efforts to determine the genuine intent of Congress. . . .

Despite the Court\'s attempt to give it a constitutional cast, the clear statement rule, at bottom, is a tool of statutory construction like any other.  So it must be, for the Judiciary has no power to redraw legislative enactments; where Congress has the authority to regulate a sphere of activity, we simply must do our best to determine whether it has done so in any particular instance.  The majority\'s rule is one method for accomplishing that task.  It is premised on the perception that Congress does not casually alter the "balance of power" between the Federal Government and the States.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#242">473 U.

Chief Justice Marshall explained for the Court in <em>Worcester</em> that a federally recognized tribe</p>\n<p>"is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of [the State] can have no force, and which the citizens of [the State] have no right to enter, but with the assent of the [tribes] themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of Congress.

Despite the States\' undeniable interest in regulating activities within its borders, and despite traditional principles of federalism, the State\'s authority has been largely displaced in matters pertaining to Native Americans.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/737/case.html">See The Kansas Indians,</a></span></em> 5 Wall. 737 (1867) (finding state taxes inapplicable to tribal lands despite partial assimilation of tribe into white society); <em>United States v.

S. 194</a></span> (1976) (holding that Congress may constitutionally inhibit a State\'s exercise of its police power over non-Indian land through federal legislation ratifying an agreement with a tribe), nor to state regulations that directly infringe upon tribal self-government.  <em>See McClanahan v.

Because spheres of activity otherwise susceptible to state regulation are, "according to the settled principles of our Constitution, . . . committed exclusively to the government of the Union," <em>Worcester v. Georgia,</em> 6 Pet. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html#561">31 U. S. 561</a></span>, where Native American affairs are concerned, the presumptions underlying the clear statement rule, and thus the rule itself, have no place in interpreting statutes pertaining to the tribes.</p>\n<p>Employing the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, I conclude that Congress intended, through \xc2\xa7 1362, to authorize constitutional claims for damages by tribes against the States.  Section 1362 provides:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of <em>all</em> civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The majority notes, correctly, that this language is no broader than that of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(a), as it existed at the time \xc2\xa7 1362 was enacted.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/case.html#784">501 U. S. 784</a></span>.  As the preceding discussion makes clear, however, this is an area in which "a page of history is worth a volume of logic."  <em>New York Trust Co. v.

A review of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 501 U. S. 793</a></p><p> history of the latter statute reveals that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 1362 to have a broader reach.</p>\n<p>Prior to 1966, the Indian tribes were largely dependent upon the United States Government to enforce their rights against state encroachment.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Minnesota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/181/case.html">270 U. S. 181</a></span> (1926).  This arrangement derived from the historic trust relationship between the tribes and the United States.  <em>See</em> F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 308 (1982 ed.).  In seeking judicial protection of tribal interests, the Federal Government, of course, was unrestrained by the doctrine of state sovereign immunity.  <em>United States v. Minnesota,</em> 270 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/181/case.html#195">270 U. S. 195</a></span>, citing <em>United States v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/621/case.html">143 U. S. 621</a></span> (1892).</p>\n<p>In 1966, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362 as part of a larger national policy of "self-determination" for the Native American peoples.  <em>See</em> M. Price &amp; R. Clinton, Law and the American Indian 86-91 (2d ed.1983).  Consistent with that policy,</p>\n<p>"Congress contemplated that \xc2\xa7 1362 would be used particularly in situations in which the United States suffered from a conflict of interest or was otherwise unable or unwilling to bring suit as trustee for the Indians."</p>\n<p><em>Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html">463 U. S. 545</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#560">463 U. S. 560</a></span>, n. 10 (1983).  In other words, Congress sought to eliminate the tribes\' dependence upon the United States for the vindication of federal rights in the federal courts.</p>\n<p>In light of that legislative purpose, we held in <em>Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U. S. 463</a></span> (1976), that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, does not bar an action to enjoin the collection of state taxes brought by a tribe pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1362, although it precludes such a suit by a private litigant.  Construing \xc2\xa7 1362, we identified a congressional intent that</p>\n<p>"a tribe\'s access to federal court to litigate a matter arising \'under the Constitution, laws, or treaties\' would be, at least in some respects, as broad as that of the United States suing as the tribe\'s trustee."</p>\n<p>425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#473">425 U. S. 473</a></span>.  Because the Federal Government could have brought </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 501 U. S. 794</a></p><p> such a suit on the tribes\' behalf, <em>see Heckman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/413/case.html">224 U. S. 413</a></span> (1912), we held that the tribes were similarly empowered by \xc2\xa7 1362.</p>\n<p>I agree with respondents that the litigation authority bestowed on the tribes through \xc2\xa7 1362 also includes the right to bring federal claims against the States for damages.  The legislative history of the statute reveals Congress\' intention that the tribes bring litigation "involving issues identical to those" that would have been raised by the United States acting as trustee for the tribes.  H.R.Rep. No. 2040, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1966) (House Report).  There is no reason to believe that this authority would be limited to prospective relief in the broad range of suits brought against the States.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, the vindication of Native American rights has been the institutional responsibility of the Federal Government since the Republic\'s founding.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/1/case.html">30 U. S. </a></span> Georgia,</em> 5 Pet. 1,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/1/case.html#17">30 U. S. 17</a></span> (1831).  Section 1362 represents a frank acknowledgment by the Government that it often lacks the resources or the political will adequately to fulfill this responsibility.  Given this admission, we should not lightly restrict the authority granted the tribes to defend their own interests.  Rather, the most reasoned interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1362 is as a congressional authorization to bring those suits that are necessary to vindicate fully the federal rights of the tribes.  It hardly requires explication that monetary remedies are often necessary to afford such relief.  Providing</p>\n<p>"the means whereby the tribes are assured of the same judicial determination whether the action is brought in their behalf by the Government or by their own attorneys,"</p>\n<p>House Report at 2-3, necessarily entails access to monetary redress from the States where federal rights have been violated.</p>\n<p>In resisting this conclusion, the majority asserts that, because the Tax Injunction Act is merely a congressional enactment, while the doctrine of sovereign immunity is a constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="795">Page 501 U. S. 795</a></p><p> one, a "willingness to eliminate the former in no way bespeaks a willingness to eliminate the latter."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/case.html#785">501 U. S. 785</a></span>.  But the premise does not lead to the conclusion.  Congress, through appropriate legislation, may abrogate state sovereign immunity, just as it may repeal or amend its own prior enactments.  Moreover, the Tax Injunction Act, like the sovereign immunity doctrine, is rooted in historical notions of federalism and comity.  <em>See Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/case.html">454 U. S. 100</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/case.html#103">454 U. S. 103</a></span> (1981), and cases cited therein.  In light of these parallels, I find the expansive congressional purpose the Court identified in <em>Moe</em> to provide substantial support for the proposition that \xc2\xa7 1362 was intended to convey federal jurisdiction over "<em>all</em> civil actions," \xc2\xa7 1362 (emphasis added), brought by recognized tribes that the Government could have brought on their behalf.</p>\n<p>"Finally, in construing this \'admittedly ambiguous\' statute, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/318/705/case.html">Board of Comm\'rs v.

Unlike the ill-conceived interpretive rule adopted so recently in <em>Atascadero,</em> this canon of construction dates back to the earliest years of our Nation\'s history.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html#582">31 U.

Indeed, it is rooted in the unique trust relationship between the tribes and the Federal Government that is inherent in the constitutional plan.  <em>See</em> U.S.Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3; Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 3.  In light of this time-honored principle of construction, it requires no linguistic contortion to read \xc2\xa7 1362\'s grant of federal jurisdiction over "all civil actions" to encompass </p><p><a class="page-number" name="796">Page 501 U.
