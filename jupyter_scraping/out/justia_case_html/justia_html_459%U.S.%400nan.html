Kansas P. &amp; L. Co., 459 U.S.  400 (1983)</h3><p><b>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co.</b></p><p><b>No. 81-1370</b></p><p><b>Argued November 9, 1982</b></p><p><b>Decided January 24, 1983</b></p><p><b>459 U.S. 400</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>In 1975, appellee public utility entered into two intrastate contracts with appellant\'s predecessor-in-interest to purchase wellhead and residue gas from a certain gas field.  Each contract contains a "governmental price escalator clause," which provides that, if any governmental authority fixes a price for any natural gas that is higher than the contract price, the contract price shall be increased to that level, and a "price redetermination clause," which gives appellant the option to have the contract price redetermined no more than once every two years by averaging the prices being paid under three other gas contracts chosen by the parties.  If the price is increased pursuant to either clause, each contract requires appellee, within specified time periods, to seek from the Kansas Corporation Commission (Commission) approval to pass the increase through to consumers.  If pass-through approval is refused and appellee elects not to pay the increase, appellant has the option to terminate the agreement.  Pursuant to the price redetermination clauses, the parties agreed on a higher price to be effective November 27, 1977, the Commission approved the pass-through of the increase to consumers, and appellee paid the new price through 1978.  Effective December 1, 1978, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 replaced earlier federal price controls for interstate natural gas with gradually increasing price ceilings, including a ceiling for newly discovered or newly produced gas (\xc2\xa7 102) and a lower ceiling for categories of gas not otherwise covered by the Act (\xc2\xa7 109).  The Act also extended federal price regulation to the intrastate gas market, providing in \xc2\xa7 105(b)(1) that the ceiling price for intrastate gas shall be the lower of the \xc2\xa7 102 price and "the price under the terms of the existing contract, to which such natural gas was subject on [November 9, 1978]."  As authorized by the federal Act, the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act was enacted in May, 1979, imposing price controls on the intrastate gas market with regard to contracts executed before April 20, 1977, and prohibiting consideration either of ceiling prices set by federal authorities or of prices paid in Kansas under other contracts in the application of governmental price escalator and price redetermination clauses.  However, the Kansas Act permits indefinite price escalator clauses to operate after March 1, 1979, to raise the price of "old" intrastate gas up to the federal Act\'s \xc2\xa7 109 ceiling price.  In November, 1978, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 459 U. S. 401</a></p><p> appellant notified appellee that gas prices would be escalated to the \xc2\xa7 102 price pursuant to the governmental price escalator clauses, but appellee, after failing to obtain pass-through approval because of its failure to file a timely application with the Commission, elected not to pay the higher price, and appellant then sought to terminate the contracts.  When appellee contended that the governmental price escalator clauses were not triggered by the federal Act, and that the Kansas Act prohibited their activation, appellant filed suit in a Kansas state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had the contractual right to terminate the contracts.  Appellee later rejected appellant\'s request under the price redetermination clauses for a price increase, to be effective in November, 1979, contending that the Kansas Act had extinguished appellee\'s obligation to comply with those clauses.  Appellant then filed an amended complaint, alleging that it was entitled to terminate the contracts because of appellee\'s refusal to redetermine the price.  Appellee counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the contracts were still in effect.  The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee, holding that the federal Act\'s imposition of price ceilings on intrastate gas did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses, and that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The Kansas Act does not impair appellant\'s contracts with appellee in violation of the Contract Clause, and thus the contract price may be escalated under either escalator clause only to the ceiling under \xc2\xa7 109 of the federal Act, not to the \xc2\xa7 102 ceiling.

Nor are the means chosen to implement these purposes deficient, particularly in light of the deference to which the Kansas Legislature\'s judgment is entitled.

The Kansas Supreme Court did not err in holding that the enactment of \xc2\xa7 105 of the federal Act did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses in these contracts so as to entitle appellant to a price increase on December 1, 1978.  As a matter of federal statutory interpretation, the federal Act does not trigger such clauses automatically.  By the language of \xc2\xa7 105(b)(1), Congress set a ceiling for the operation of contractual provisions; it did not prescribe a price.  And the Kansas Supreme Court\'s holding that the particular governmental price escalator clauses involved here were insufficient to escalate the gas price is an interpretation of state law to which this Court defers.

It presents a federal Contract Clause issue and a statutory issue.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On September 27, 1975, The Kansas Power &amp; Light Company (KPL), a public utility and appellee here, entered into two intrastate natural gas supply contracts with Clinton Oil Company, the predecessor-in-interest of appellant Energy Reserves Group, Inc. (ERG).  Under the first contract, KPL agrees to purchase gas directly at the wellhead on the Spivey-Grabs Field in Kingman and Harper Counties in southern Kansas.  The second contract obligates KPL to purchase from the same field residue gas, that is, gas remaining after certain recovery and processing steps are completed.  The original contract price was $1.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas.  The contracts continue in effect for the life of the field or for the life of the processing plants associated with the field.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Each contract contains two clauses known generically as indefinite price escalators.  The first is a governmental price escalator clause; this provides that, if a governmental authority fixes a price for any natural gas that is higher than the price specified in the contract, the contract price shall be increased to that level. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The second is a price redetermination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 459 U. S. 404</a></p><p> clause; this gives ERG the option to have the contract price redetermined no more than once every two years. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The new price is then set by averaging the prices being paid under three other gas contracts chosen by the parties.</p>\n<p>When the price is increased pursuant to either of these clauses, each contract requires KPL to seek from the Kansas Corporation Commission (Commission) approval to pass the increase through to consumers.  App. to Juris.Statement 69a.  The application for approval is to be submitted within 5 days after a price increase resulting from governmental action, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 459 U. S. 405</a></p><p> or no fewer than 60 days before a price redetermination increase is to become effective.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the Commission refuses to permit the pass-through and KPL elects not to pay the increase, ERG has the option to terminate the agreement on 30 days\' written notice.</p>\n<p>Each contract states that the purpose of the price escalator clauses is "solely" to compensate ERG for "anticipated" increases in its operating costs and in the value of its gas.  <em>Id.</em> at 70a.  Each contract also provides:  "Neither party shall be held in default for failure to perform hereunder if such failure is due to compliance with," <em>ibid.,</em> any "relevant present and future state and federal laws."  <em>Id.</em> at 69a.</p>\n<p>In 1977, ERG invoked the price redetermination clause, and the parties agreed on a price of $1.77 per Mcf, effective November 27 of that year. T he Commission approved the pass-through of this increase to consumers.  KPL paid the new price through 1978. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>On December 1, 1978, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (Act), Pub.L. 95-621, 92 Stat. 3350, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3301 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. V), designed in principal part to encourage increased natural gas production, became effective.  The Act replaced the federal price controls that had been established under the Natural Gas Act, ch. 556, 52 Stat. 821, with price ceilings that rise monthly based on "an inflation adjustment factor" and other considerations.  Different ceilings are set for different types of gas.  Section 102 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3312 (1976 ed., Supp. V), sets a gradually increasing ceiling price for newly discovered or newly produced natural gas.  The December 1978 ceiling price under \xc2\xa7 102 was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 459 U. S. 406</a></p><p> $2.078 per million British thermal units.  Section 104 sets ceiling prices for "old" interstate gas, that is, gas from already discovered and producing wells.  Section 109 sets another ceiling price for categories of natural gas not covered by the other sections of the Act.  As of December, 1978, the \xc2\xa7 109 ceiling price was $1.63 per million Btu\'s.</p>\n<p>In another departure from the 1938 Natural Gas Act, the new Act extended federal price regulation to the intrastate gas market.  <em>See</em> S.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1126, pp. 67-68 (1978); H.R. Conf Rep. No. 95-1752, pp. 67-68 (1978).  Section 105 of the Act establishes the rule for applying price ceilings to intrastate gas, described as gas not committed to interstate commerce on November 8, 1978. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It provides, in its subsection (b)(1), that the maximum lawful price of such gas</p>\n<p>"shall be the lower of . . . the price under the terms of the existing contract, to which such natural gas was subject on [November 9, 1978], . . . or . . . the maximum lawful price . . . computed for such month under section 102 (relating to new natural gas). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]"</p>\n<p>The parties agree that \xc2\xa7 105(b)(1) governs these contracts.</p>\n<p>The Act, by \xc2\xa7 602(a), also permits a State</p>\n<p>"to establish or enforce any maximum lawful price for the first sale of natural </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 459 U. S. 407</a></p><p> gas produced in such State which does not exceed the applicable maximum lawful price, if any, under title I of this Act."</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>In direct response to the Act, the Kansas Legislature promptly imposed price controls on the intrastate gas market.  In May, 1979, the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act (Kansas Act), 1979 Kan.Sess.Laws, ch. 171, codified as Kan.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 55-1401 to 55-1415 (Supp.1982), was enacted. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Kansas Act applies only to natural gas contracts executed before April 20, 1977, \xc2\xa7 55-1403, and controls natural gas prices until December 31, 1984, \xc2\xa7 55-1411.  Section 55-1404 prohibits consideration either of ceiling prices set by federal authorities or of prices paid in Kansas under other contracts in the application of governmental price escalator clauses and price redetermination clauses. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Section </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 459 U. S. 408</a></p><p> 55-1405 of the Kansas Act, however, permits indefinite price escalator clauses to operate after March 1, 1979, to raise the price of old intrastate gas up to the federal Act\'s \xc2\xa7 109 ceiling price.  Section \xc2\xa7 55-1406 exempts new gas and gas from stripper wells.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>On November 20, 1978, ERG and other gas suppliers having similar contracts with KPL notified KPL that gas prices would be escalated to the \xc2\xa7 102 price on December 1, pursuant to the governmental price escalator clause.  KPL sought pass-through approval from the Commission for this increase by an application filed December 7, one day too late to satisfy the 5-day contractual requirement.  KPL never elected to pay the higher price.</p>\n<p>On June 5, 1979, ERG notified KPL that it would terminate the contracts within 30 days because KPL had failed to apply to the Commission for pass-through authority within five days of December 1, 1978, had failed to obtain Commission approval, and had failed to pay the increased price ERG contends was required by the governmental price escalator clause.  KPL\'s response was that the clause was not triggered by the Act, and that the Kansas Act prohibited its activation.  ERG then filed an action in the District Court of Harper County, Kan., praying for a declaratory judgment that it had the contractual right to terminate the contracts.</p>\n<p>On July 24, in light of KPL\'s refusal to terminate, ERG requested an increase up to the Act\'s \xc2\xa7 102 ceiling price under the price redetermination clause.  The increase was to be effective in November, 1979, the next redetermination date possible under the contracts.  KPL conceded that the price redetermination clause permitted such an increase, but contended that \xc2\xa7 55-1404 of the Kansas Act had extinguished the utility\'s obligation to comply with that clause.  ERG then filed an amended complaint, alleging that it was entitled to terminate the contracts because of KPL\'s refusal to redetermine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 459 U. S. 409</a></p><p> the price.  KPL counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the contracts were still in effect.</p>\n<p>On the parties\' cross-motions for summary judgment, the state trial court held that the Act\'s imposition of price ceilings on intrastate gas did not trigger the governmental escalator clause.  It also found that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause, reasoning that Kansas has a legitimate interest in addressing and controlling the serious economic dislocations that the sudden increase in gas prices would cause, and that the Kansas Act reasonably furthered that interest.  App. to Juris.Statement 25a, 42a, 45a.  The Supreme Court of Kansas, by unanimous vote, affirmed.  230 Kan. 176, 630 P.2d 1142 (1981).

The constitutional issue is whether the Kansas Act impairs ERG\'s contracts with KPL in violation of the Contract Clause, U.S.Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 1. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The statutory issue is whether the federal enactment of \xc2\xa7 105 triggered the governmental price escalator clause.  As to the latter issue, if \xc2\xa7 105\'s enactment did have that effect, ERG was entitled to a price increase on December 1, 1978.  If not, ERG could rely only on the price redetermination clause for any increase.  That clause could not be exercised until November, 1979.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 459 U. S. 410</a></p><p> statutory issue thus controls the timing of any increase.  The constitutional issue, on the other hand, affects the price that ERG may claim under either clause.  If ERG prevails, the price may be escalated to the \xc2\xa7 102 ceiling; if ERG does not prevail, the price may be escalated only to the \xc2\xa7 109 ceiling.

Significant here is the fact that the parties are operating in a heavily regulated industry. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  <em>See Veix v. Sixth Ward Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn.,</em> 310 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/32/case.html#38">310 U. S. 38</a></span>.  State authority to regulate natural gas prices is well established.  <em>See Cities Service Gas Co. v. Peerless Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/179/case.html">340 U. S. 179</a></span> (1950). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  At the time of the execution of these contracts, Kansas did not regulate natural gas prices specifically, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] but its supervision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 459 U. S. 414</a></p><p> of the industry was extensive and intrusive. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Moreover, under the authority of \xc2\xa7 5(a) of the 1938 Natural Gas Act, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) set "just and reasonable" rates for prices of gas both at the wellhead and in pipelines.  Although prices in the intrastate market have diverged somewhat from those in the interstate market due to the recent shortage of natural gas, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] the regulation of interstate prices effectively limits intrastate price increases. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 459 U. S. 415</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is in this context that the indefinite escalator clauses at issue here are to be viewed.  In drafting each of the contracts, the parties included a statement of intent, which made clear that the escalator clause was designed to guarantee price increases consistent with <em>anticipated</em> increases in the value of ERG\'s gas.  App. to Juris.Statement 70a.  While it is not entirely inconceivable that ERG in September, 1975, anticipated the deregulation of gas prices introduced by the Act in 1978, we think this is highly unlikely, and we read the statement of intent to refer to nothing more than changes in value resulting from changes in the federal regulator\'s "just and reasonable" rates.  In exchange for these anticipated increases, KPL agreed to accept gas from the Spivey-Grabs field for the lifetime of that field.  Thus, at the time of the execution of the contracts, ERG did not expect to receive deregulated prices.  The very existence of the governmental price escalator clause and the price redetermination clause indicates that the contracts were structured against the background of regulated gas prices.  If deregulation had not occurred, the contracts undoubtedly would have called for a much smaller price increase than that provided by the Kansas Act\'s adoption of the \xc2\xa7 109 ceiling. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 459 U. S. 416</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, the contracts expressly recognize the existence of extensive regulation by providing that any contractual terms are subject to relevant present and future state and federal law. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  This latter provision could be interpreted to incorporate all future state price regulation, and thus dispose of the Contract Clause claim.  Regardless of whether this interpretation is correct, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] the provision does suggest that ERG knew its contractual rights were subject to alteration by state price regulation.  Price regulation existed and was foreseeable as the type of law that would alter contract obligations.  Reading the Contract Clause as ERG does would mean that indefinite price escalator clauses could exempt ERG from any regulatory limitation of prices whatsoever.  Such a result cannot be permitted.  <em>Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter,</em> 209 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/349/case.html#357">209 U. S. 357</a></span>.  In short, ERG\'s reasonable expectations have not been impaired by the Kansas Act.  <em>See El Paso v. Simmons,</em> 379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/497/case.html#515">379 U. S. 515</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>To the extent, if any, the Kansas Act impairs ERG\'s contractual interests, the Kansas Act rests on, and is prompted by, significant and legitimate state interests.  Kansas has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 459 U. S. 417</a></p><p> exercised its police power to protect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation.  The State reasonably could find that higher gas prices have caused and will cause hardship among those who use gas heat but must exist on limited fixed incomes.</p>\n<p>The State also has a legitimate interest in correcting the imbalance between the interstate and intrastate markets by permitting intrastate prices to rise only to the \xc2\xa7 109 level.  By slowly deregulating interstate prices, the Act took the cap off intrastate prices as well. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The Kansas Act attempts to coordinate the intrastate and interstate prices by supplementing the federal Act\'s regulation of intrastate gas.  Congress specifically contemplated such action:</p>\n<p>"The conference agreement provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the authority of any State to establish or enforce any maximum lawful price for sales of gas in intrastate commerce which does not exceed the applicable maximum lawful price, if any, under Title I of this Act.  This authority extends to the operation of any indefinite price escalator clause."</p>\n<p>S.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1126, pp. 124-125 (1978); H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 951752, pp. 124-125 (1978).  There can be little doubt about the legitimate public purpose behind the Act. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 459 U. S. 418</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nor are the means chosen to implement these purposes deficient, particularly in light of the deference to which the Kansas Legislature\'s judgment is entitled.  On the surface, the State\'s Act seems limited to altering indefinite price escalation clauses of intrastate contracts that affect less than 10% of the natural gas consumed in Kansas.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  To analyze properly the Kansas Act\'s effect, however, we must consider the entire state and federal gas price regulatory structure.  Only natural gas subject to indefinite price escalator clauses poses the danger of rapidly increasing prices in Kansas.  Gas under contracts with fixed escalator clauses and interstate gas purchased by the utilities subject to \xc2\xa7 109 would not escalate as would intrastate gas subject to indefinite price escalator clauses.  The Kansas Act simply brings the latter category into line with old interstate gas prices by limiting the operation of the indefinite price escalator clauses.</p>\n<p>The Kansas Act also rationally exempts the types of new gas the production of which Congress sought to encourage through the higher \xc2\xa7 102 prices.  Finally, the Act is a temporary measure that expires when federal price regulation of certain categories of gas terminates.  The Kansas statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 459 U. S. 419</a></p><p> completes the regulation of the gas market by imposing gradual escalation mechanisms on the intrastate market, consistent with the new national policy toward gas regulation.</p>\n<p>We thus resolve the constitutional issue against ERG.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We turn to ERG\'s statutory contention that the Kansas courts misconstrued \xc2\xa7 105 as fixing the contract price at the November 9, 1978, level.  While, on this point, the opinion of the Kansas Supreme Court is not entirely clear to us, it does not appear so to construe \xc2\xa7 105.  And KPL, in fact, does not contend that it did.  Instead, the court recognized that \xc2\xa7 105 permits the indefinite price escalator clauses to continue to operate to raise the contract price up to the lawful ceiling.  <em>See Pennzoil Co. v. FERC,</em> 645 F.2d 360, 379 (CA5 1981) ("[T]he NGPA does not preclude escalation of area rate clauses [a type of indefinite price escalators] to NGPA prices"), <em>cert. denied,</em> 454 U.S. 1142 (1982).</p>\n<p>The actual point of dispute is whether the governmental price escalator clauses in these contracts were triggered by the enactment of \xc2\xa7 105.  The Kansas Supreme Court acknowledged that the Act could trigger a governmental price escalator clause.  230 Kan. at 184, 630 P.2d at 1149.  In this case, however, it held that "[t]he NGPA did not trigger a price increase because the contracts herein did not contain a sufficient escalation mechanism."  <em>Id.</em> at 185, 630 P.2d at 1150.  We agree that, as a matter of federal statutory interpretation, the Act does not trigger such clauses automatically.  <em>See</em> 44 Fed.Reg. 16895, 16904 (1979). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Section 105(b)(1) provides that the ceiling price shall be the lower of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 459 U.

The conferees do not intend that the mere establishment of the ceiling prices under this Act shall trigger indefinite price escalator clauses in existing intrastate contracts."</p>\n<p>S.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1126, pp. 8283 (1978); H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1752, pp. 82-83 (1978).  <em>See Pennzoil Co. v. FERC,</em> 645 F.2d at 379.</p>\n<p>The Kansas Supreme Court relied on its prior decision in <em>Mesa Petroleum Co. v. Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> 229 Kan. 631, 629 P.2d 190, <em>clarified,</em> 230 Kan. 166, 630 P.2d 1129 (1981), <em>cert. denied,</em> 455 U.S. 928 (1982), which interpreted the effect of \xc2\xa7 105 on a similar contract provision.  In that decision, it read \xc2\xa7 105 to set the lawful ceiling at the lower price provided by the contract.  In light of our discussion above, we view this reading of the federal statute as unassailable.  The Kansas Supreme Court\'s further holding in this case that these particular governmental price escalator clauses were insufficient to escalate the gas price is an interpretation of state law to which, of course, we defer.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The regulation of energy production and use is a matter of national concern.  Congress set out on a new path with the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  In pursuing this path, Congress explicitly envisioned that the States would regulate intrastate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 459 U. S. 421</a></p><p> markets in accordance with the overall national policy.  The Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act is one State\'s effort to balance the need to provide incentives for the production of gas against the need to protect consumers from hardships brought on by deregulation of a traditionally regulated commodity.  We see no constitutional or statutory infirmity in Kansas\' attempt.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The governmental price escalator provision states:</p>\n<p>"If any federal or Kansas regulatory or governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises shall at any time hereafter fix a price per MCF applicable to any natural gas of any vintage produced in Kansas higher than the contract price then in effect under this gas contract, the price to be paid for gas thereafter shall be increased to equal such regulated price.

The court concluded, however, that the State\'s interest and chosen means could justify a retroactive application.  230 Kan. at 189-190, 630 P.2d at 1153.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>"No State shall . . . pass any . . .

Under the contract, ERG was entitled to an increase of two cents per Mcf each year absent a price redetermination in excess of that amount.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A price redetermination occurred in November, 1977, and by November, 1978, the contract price had risen to $1.77 per Mcf.

Given the nature of the industry -- sales to public utilities -- it is impossible for any regulation not to have a major effect on a small number of participants.  This differs from the statute under challenge in <em>Allied Structural Steel Co.,</em> where a small number of employers were singled out from the larger group.  The fact that there was a close vote at the committee stage, and that some of the committee dissenters expressed the view that the Kansas Act was special interest legislation, bears little if any resemblance to the circumstantial evidence present in <em>Allied Structural Steel Co.</em>  Nor is there any indication that the Kansas political process had broken down.  <em>Cf.</em> Note, 89 Yale L.J. at 1645 (provided "legislature is functioning properly, selection of a public purpose and determinations of necessity and appropriateness should be left to it").  In addition, the automatic price pass-through adjustment indicates that KPL will not benefit significantly from the statute.
