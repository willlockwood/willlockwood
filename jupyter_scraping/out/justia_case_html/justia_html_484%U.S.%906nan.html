The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. </p><p></p><p> Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. In White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/445/case.html#451">455 U.S. 445, 451</a>, 1166 (1982), we held that a claim " for attorney\'s fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action," and that such a request was not a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). In the years that have followed, we have not determined if White\'s holding applies only to fee requests under a separate statutory provision like 1988, or if it also renders "collateral" those fee requests made in cases where the fee award arises as an integral part of the underlying dispute between the parties. Consequently, several questions concerning the finality (and, as a result, the appealability) of judgments encompassing fee awards in cases of the latter type have been the subject of confusion in the Courts of Appeals. This case raises such a question. Here, respondent prevailed in its action seeking judgment on four promissory notes executed by petitioners. The District Court awarded respondent principal and interest " plus reasonable attorney\'s fees incurred" by respondent. App. to Pet. for Cert. D-7. The District Court did not fix an amount for the attorney\'s fees at that time. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment below; it mentioned, but did not specifically review, the District Court\'s award of attorney\'s fees. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/752/307/">752 F.2d 307</a>, 308 (CA7 1985). On respondent\'s subsequent petition for fees, however, the District Court entertained petitioners\' Illinois law challenge to the fee award, and determined that Illinois law prohibited a fee award in this case. 635 F.Supp. 1257 (ND Ill.1986). The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that " reservation of the determination of the amount of attorney\'s fees does not deprive the initial [district court] judgment of finality," and therefore the District Court could not reconsider respondent\'s entitlement to fees in its second decision. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/816/341/">816 F.2d 341</a>, 342 (CA7 1987). The Courts of Appeals are sharply divided over the question presented here: whether an award of attorney\'s fees, when it arises out of a claimant\'s underlying cause of action, is final before that award is quantified.

Four Circuits have held that an attorney\'s fee award, when that award is not won in a collateral proceeding (such as a 1988 action), is not final until the amount of the award is quantified.
