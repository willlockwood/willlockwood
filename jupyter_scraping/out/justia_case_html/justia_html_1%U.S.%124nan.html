For instance, a bond to pay L.100, with annual interest at 6 per cent and at the end of six months, L. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>] is paid in. This payment shall not be apportioned, L. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] to the discharge of the half year\'s interest, and L. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>] to the diminution of the principal; so as to calculate the remaining interest at 6 per cent, upon L. [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>] for six months; But the interest shall be charged at the end of the year upon L.100; the payment of L.
