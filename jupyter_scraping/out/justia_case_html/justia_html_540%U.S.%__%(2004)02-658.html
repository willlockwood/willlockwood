Argued October 8, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 21, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s (CAA or Act) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa77477, was designed to ensure that the air quality in \xe2\x80\x9cattainment areas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> areas that are already \xe2\x80\x9cclean,\xe2\x80\x9d will not degrade, see \xc2\xa77470(1).  The program bars construction of any major air pollutant emitting facility not equipped with \xe2\x80\x9cthe best available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d (BACT).  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).  The Act defines BACT as \xe2\x80\x9can emission limitation based on the maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction \xe2\x80\xa6 which the [state] permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [the] facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).  Two provisions of the Act vest enforcement authority in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Section \xc2\xa7113(a)(5) generally authorizes the EPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAA \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d governing construction of a pollutant source, to pursue remedial action, including issuance of \xe2\x80\x9can order prohibiting construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77413(a).  Directed specifically to the PSD program, CAA \xc2\xa7167 instructs EPA to \xe2\x80\x9ctake such measures, including issuance of an order, \xe2\x80\xa6 as necessary to prevent the construction\xe2\x80\x9d of a major pollutant emitting facility that does not conform to the \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the program.  Because EPA has classified northwest Alaska, the region here at issue, as an attainment area for nitrogen dioxide, the PSD program applies to emissions of that pollutant in the region.  No \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility,\xe2\x80\x9d including any source emitting more than 250 tons of nitrogen oxides per year, \xc2\xa77479(1), may be constructed or modified unless a PSD permit has been issued for the facility, \xc2\xa77475(a)(1).  A PSD permit may not issue unless the proposed facility is subject to BACT for each CAA-regulated pollutant emitted from the facility.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe permitting authority\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77479(3) is Alaska, acting through petitioner, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  In 1988, Teck Cominco Alaska, Inc. (Cominco), obtained authorization to operate a zinc concentrate mine in northwest Alaska.  The mine is a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77475.  Its initial PSD permit authorized five diesel electric generators, MG\xe2\x80\x931 through MG\xe2\x80\x935, subject to operating restrictions.  Under a second PSD permit issued in 1994, Cominco added a sixth generator, MG\xe2\x80\x936.  In 1996, Cominco initiated a project to expand zinc production by 40% and applied to ADEC for a PSD permit to allow, <em>inter alia</em>, increased electricity generation by MG\xe2\x80\x935.  ADEC preliminarily proposed as BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x935 an emission control technology known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 90%.  Amending its application, Cominco added a seventh generator, MG\xe2\x80\x9317, and proposed, as BACT, an alternative control technology\xe2\x80\x94Low NOx\xe2\x80\x94that achieves a 30% reduction in nitrogen oxide pollutants.  In May 1999, ADEC issued a first draft PSD permit and preliminary technical analysis report, concluding that Low NOx was BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x935 and MG\xe2\x80\x9317.  ADEC identified SCR as the most stringent technology then technically and economically feasible.  ADEC nevertheless endorsed Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s proffered emissions-offsetting alternative of fitting MG\xe2\x80\x9317 and all six existing generators with Low NOx, rather than fitting MG\xe2\x80\x935 and MG\xe2\x80\x9317 with SCR.  This proposal, ADEC submitted, would achieve a maximum NOx reduction similar to the reduction SCR could achieve, and was logistically and economically less onerous for Cominco.  In July 1999, EPA objected that ADEC had identified SCR as the best control technology, but failed to require it as BACT.  ADEC responded with a second draft PSD permit and technical analysis report in September 1999, again finding Low NOx to be BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x9317.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s second draft abandoned that agency\xe2\x80\x99s May 1999 emissions-offsetting justification.  ADEC further conceded that, lacking data from Cominco, it could make no judgment as to SCR\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation, profitability, and competitiveness.  It nonetheless concluded, contradicting its earlier finding that SCR was technically and economically feasible, that SCR imposed \xe2\x80\x9ca disproportionate cost\xe2\x80\x9d on the mine.  In support of this conclusion, ADEC analogized the mine to a rural utility that would have to increase prices were it required to use SCR.  Protesting that Cominco had not adequately demonstrated site-specific factors supporting the assertion of SCR\xe2\x80\x99s economical infeasibility, EPA suggested that ADEC include an analysis of SCR\xe2\x80\x99s adverse economic impacts on Cominco.  Expressing confidentiality concerns, Cominco declined to submit financial data.  In December 1999, ADEC issued a final permit and technical analysis report approving Low NOx as BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x9317.  Again conceding that it made no judgment as to SCR\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation, profitability, and competitiveness, ADEC advanced, as cause for its decision, SCR\xe2\x80\x99s adverse effect on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s unique and continuing impact on the region\xe2\x80\x99s economic diversity and the venture\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cworld competitiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  ADEC reiterated its rural Alaska utility analogy, and compared SCR\xe2\x80\x99s cost to the costs of other, less stringent, control technologies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA then issued three orders to ADEC under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act.  Those orders prohibited ADEC from issuing a PSD permit to Cominco without satisfactorily documenting why SCR was not BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x9317.  In addition, EPA prohibited Cominco from beginning construction or modification activities at the mine, with limited exceptions.  Ruling on ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s and Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s challenges to these orders, the Ninth Circuit held that EPA had authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the State\xe2\x80\x99s justification for its BACT decision.  The Court of Appeals  emphasized that provision of a reasoned justification for a BACT determination by a permitting authority is undeniably a CAA \xe2\x80\x9crequirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  EPA had properly exercised its discretion in issuing the three orders, the Ninth Circuit held, because (1) Cominco failed to demonstrate SCR\xe2\x80\x99s economical infeasibility, and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>CAA authorizes EPA to stop construction of a major pollutant emitting facility permitted by a state authority when EPA finds that an authority\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination is unreasonable in light of 42 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77479(3), and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s listing of BACT as a \xe2\x80\x9c[p]reconstruction requiremen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for the PSD program, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77475(a)(1) and (4), to mandate a determination of BACT faithful to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  EPA urges that state permitting authorities\xe2\x80\x99 statutory discretion is constrained by \xc2\xa77479(3)\xe2\x80\x99s strong, normative terms \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cachievable.\xe2\x80\x9d  EPA accordingly reads \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 to empower the federal Agency to check a state agency\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonably lax BACT designation.  In support of this reading, EPA notes that Congress intended the PSD program to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in clean-air areas.  Without a federal Agency surveillance role that extends to BACT determinations, EPA maintains, this goal is unlikely to be realized.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history suggests that, absent national guidelines, a State deciding to set and enforce strict clean-air standards may lose existing industrial plants to more permissive States.  The legislative history further suggests that without a federal check, new plants will play one State off against another with threats to locate in whichever State adopts the most permissive pollution controls.  The Court agrees with EPA\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statutory provisions.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s CAA construction is reflected in interpretive guides EPA has several times published.  Although an interpretation presented in internal guidance memoranda does not qualify for dispositive force under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 865\xe2\x80\x93866, a cogent administrative interpretation nevertheless warrants respect, <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v.<em> Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 385.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s several arguments do not persuade the Court to reject as impermissible EPA\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding, consistently maintained interpretation.  ADEC argues that CAA\xe2\x80\x99s BACT definition, \xc2\xa77479(3), unambiguously assigns to \xe2\x80\x9cthe permitting authority\xe2\x80\x9d alone the decision of the control technology qualifying as \xe2\x80\x9cbest available.\xe2\x80\x9d  In ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s view, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement role is restricted to assuring that the permit contain a BACT limitation.  CAA entrusts state authorities with initial responsibility to make BACT determinations because they are best positioned to adjust for local circumstances that might make a technology \xe2\x80\x9cunavailable\xe2\x80\x9d in a particular area.  According state authorities initial responsibility, however, does not signify that there can be no <em>unreasonable</em> state agency BACT determinations.  Congress vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT.  Having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, Congress would not have implicitly precluded EPA from verifying a state authority\xe2\x80\x99s substantive compliance with the BACT requirement.  Nor would Congress have limited EPA to determining whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words \xe2\x80\x9cBACT.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that \xc2\xa77475(a)(8) expressly requires EPA approval of a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination in a limited category of cases does not mean EPA lacks supervisory authority in all other cases.  Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not <em>require</em> EPA approval of all state BACT determinations.  Those provisions simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.  Also unavailing is ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that any reasoned justification requirement for a BACT determination may be enforced only through state administrative and judicial processes in order to allow development of an adequate factual record, to ensure EPA carries the burdens of proof, and to promote certainty.  The Court declines to read into CAA\xe2\x80\x99s silence the unusual requirement that a federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s decisions enforcing federal law must be remitted solely to state court.  EPA has rationally interpreted the BACT provisions and its own \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facility\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  Nor is the Court persuaded by ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s practical concerns.  There is no reason to conclude that an appropriate record cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decision\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness.  In this very case, the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record.  After EPA did so, all the parties agreed to the record\xe2\x80\x99s adequacy.  As to the burdens of production and persuasion, the Court holds that EPA bears both burdens in a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order as well as in an EPA-initiated civil action.  The underlying question a reviewing court must answer is the same in either case:\xc2\xa0Was the BACT determination unreasonable given the statutory guides and the state administrative record.  Nor does the Court find compelling the suggestion that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA will be free to invalidate a BACT determination months or years after a permit issues.  This case involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, not postconstruction federal directives.  EPA itself regards it as imperative to act on a timely basis.  Courts are also less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the further planning and construction have progressed.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0In this case, EPA properly exercised its statutory authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 in finding that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Low NOx as BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x9317 lacked evidentiary support.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s orders, therefore, were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court considers whether EPA\xe2\x80\x99s finding was \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\xe2\x80\x9d under the applicable review standard set forth in the APA, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  While EPA\xe2\x80\x99s three skeletal orders were not composed with ideal clarity, they properly ground EPA\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination when read together with EPA\xe2\x80\x99s accompanying explanatory correspondence.  See <em>Bowman Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Arkansas&amp;nbhyph;Best Freight System, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/281/index.html">419 U. S. 281</a>, 286.  As the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s BACT designation did not qualify as reasonable in light of statutory guides.  In the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both technically and economically feasible.  That technology should have been designated BACT absent considerations justifying a conclusion that SCR was not achievable in this case.  ADEC, however, selected Low NOx as BACT based on Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s emissions-offsetting suggestion.  In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on that suggestion.  Rather, ADEC candidly stated that it aimed to support Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s project and its contributions to the region.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s selection of Low NOx thus rested squarely and solely on SCR\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  EPA rightly concluded that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record.  ADEC forthrightly conceded it was disarmed from reaching a judgment on SCR\xe2\x80\x99s economic impact on the mine by Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to provide relevant financial data.  No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR, would be obliged to cut personnel or raise zinc prices.  Having acknowledged that it lacked information needed to judge SCR\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation, profitability, or competitiveness, ADEC could not simultaneously proffer threats to the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation and competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible.  Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice.  To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked cost figures discussed in four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production.  ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCR\xe2\x80\x99s per-ton cost to be well within what ADEC and EPA consider economically feasible.  No reasoned explanation for ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s retreat from this position appears in the permit ADEC issued.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness to support Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s project and its contributions to the region.  This justification, however, hardly meets ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s own standard of a source-specific economic impact that demonstrates SCR to be inappropriate as BACT.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s justification that lower aggregate emissions would result from Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to install Low NOx on <em>all</em> its generators is also unpersuasive.  The final PSD permit did not offset MG\xe2\x80\x9317\xe2\x80\x99s emissions against those of the mine\xe2\x80\x99s six existing generators.  As ADEC recognized in September and December 1999, a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is part of the permit action.  In December 1999, however, only MG\xe2\x80\x9317 figured in the permit action.

In letters and orders throughout the permitting process and at oral argument, EPA repeatedly acknowledged that ADEC may yet prepare an appropriate record supporting its selection of Low NOx as BACT.  There is no reason not to take EPA at its word.

Under that program, no major air pollutant emitting facility may be constructed unless the facility is equipped with \xe2\x80\x9cthe best available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d (BACT).  As added by \xc2\xa7165, 91 Stat. 735, and amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).  BACT, as defined in the CAA, means, for any major air pollutant emitting facility, \xe2\x80\x9can emission limitation based on the maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction \xe2\x80\xa6 which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [the] facility\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regarding EPA oversight, the Act includes a general instruction and one geared specifically to the PSD program.  The general prescription, \xc2\xa7113(a)(5) of the Act, authorizes EPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAA requirement governing construction of a pollutant source, to issue an order prohibiting construction, to prescribe an administrative penalty, or to commence a civil action for injunctive relief.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77413(a).  Directed specifically to the PSD program, CAA \xc2\xa7167 instructs EPA to \xe2\x80\x9ctake such measures, including issuance of an order, or seeking injunctive relief, as necessary to prevent the construction\xe2\x80\x9d of a major pollutant emitting facility that does not conform to the PSD requirements of the Act.  42 U.

Responding to litigation initiated by an environmental group,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] however, EPA issued regulations in 1974 requiring that SIPs include a PSD program.  <em>Id.</em>, at 347, and n.\xc2\xa018 (citing 39 Fed.

No such facility may be constructed or modified unless a permit prescribing emission limitations has been issued for the facility.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(1); see \xc2\xa77479(2)(C) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d).  Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s SIP imposes an analogous requirement.  18 Alaska Admin. Code \xc2\xa750.300(c)(1) (2003).  Modifications to major emitting facilities that increase nitrogen oxide emissions in excess of 40 tons per year require a PSD permit.  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(23)(i) (2002); 18 Alaska Admin. Code \xc2\xa750.300(h)(3)(B)(ii) (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act sets out preconditions for the issuance of PSD permits.  <em>Inter alia</em>, no PSD permit may issue unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe proposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to [CAA] regulation \xe2\x80\xa6 emitted from \xe2\x80\xa6 [the] facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).  As described in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provisions, \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d (BACT) means:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  In no event shall application of \xe2\x80\x98best available control technology\xe2\x80\x99 result in emissions of any pollutants which will exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard established pursuant to section 7411 or 7412 of this title [emission standards for new and existing stationary sources].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).</p>\n<p align="left">\n40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(12) (2002) (repeating statutory definition).  Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s SIP contains provisions that track the statutory BACT requirement and definition.  18 Alaska Admin. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa750.310(d)(3) and 50.990(13) (2003).  The State, with slightly variant terminology, defines BACT as \xe2\x80\x9cthe emission limitation that represents the maximum reduction achievable for each regulated air contaminant, taking into account energy, environmental and economic impacts, and other costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under the federal Act, a limited class of sources must gain advance EPA approval for the BACT prescribed in the permit.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(8).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CAA also provides that a PSD permit may issue only if a source \xe2\x80\x9cwill not cause, or contribute to, air pollution in excess of any \xe2\x80\xa6 maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration for any pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d or any NAAQS.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(3).  Congress left to the Agency the determination of most maximum allowable increases, or \xe2\x80\x9cincrements,\xe2\x80\x9d in pollutants.  EPA regulations have defined increments for nitrogen oxides.  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(c) (2002).  Typically, to demonstrate that increments will not be exceeded, applicants use mathematical models of pollutant plumes, their behavior, and their dispersion.

The first prescription, \xc2\xa7113(a)(5) of the Act, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]henever, on the basis of any available information, [EPA] finds that a State is not acting in compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the chapter relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources,\xe2\x80\x9d EPA may \xe2\x80\x9cissue an order prohibiting the construction or modification of any major stationary source in any area to which such requirement applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

Anticipating that the project would increase nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 40 tons per year, see <em>supra</em>, at 5, Cominco applied to ADEC for a PSD permit to allow, <em>inter alia</em>, increased electricity generation by its standby generator, MG\xe2\x80\x935.

Responding to Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the preliminary permit, engineering staff in ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s Air Permits Program pointed out that, according to information Cominco provided to ADEC, \xe2\x80\x9cSCR has been installed on similar diesel-fired engines throughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 102.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite its staff\xe2\x80\x99s clear view \xe2\x80\x9cthat SCR (the most effective individual technology) [was] technologically, environmentally, and economically feasible for the Red Dog power plant engines,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 103\xe2\x80\x93104, ADEC endorsed the alternative proffered by Cominco.  To achieve nitrogen oxide emission reductions commensurate with SCR\xe2\x80\x99s 90% impact, Cominco proposed fitting the new generator MG\xe2\x80\x9317 and the six existing generators with Low NOx.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</em>  Cominco asserted that it could lower net emissions by 396 tons per year if it fitted all seven generators with Low NOx rather than fitting two (MG\xe2\x80\x935 and MG\xe2\x80\x9317) with SCR and choosing one of them as the standby unit.  <em>Id.,</em> at 87.  Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s proposal hinged on the \xe2\x80\x9cassumption \xe2\x80\xa6 that under typical operating conditions one or more engines will not be running due to maintenance of standby-generation capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If all seven generators ran continuously, however, Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s alternative would increase emissions by 79 tons per year.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accepting Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s submission, ADEC stated that Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s Low NOx solution \xe2\x80\x9cachieve[d] a similar maximum NOx reduction as the most stringent controls; [could] potentially result in a greater NOx reduction; and is logistically and economically less onerous to Cominco.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 87\xe2\x80\x9388.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the final day of the public comment period, July 2, 1999, the United States Department of the Interior, National Parks Service (NPS), submitted comments to ADEC.

NPS objected to the projected offset of new emissions from MG\xe2\x80\x935 and MG\xe2\x80\x9317 against emissions from other existing generators that were not subject to BACT.  Letter from John Notar, NPS Air Resources Division, to Jim Baumgartner, ADEC (June 2, 1999).  Such an offset, NPS commented, \xe2\x80\x9cis neither allowed by BACT, nor achieves the degree of reduction that would result if all the generators that are subject to BACT were equipped with SCR.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3.  NPS further observed that the proposed production-increase project would remove operating restrictions that the 1994 PSD permit had placed on four of the existing generators\xe2\x80\x94MG\xe2\x80\x931, MG\xe2\x80\x933, MG\xe2\x80\x934, and MG\xe2\x80\x935.

ADEC concluded, on a \xe2\x80\x9ccursory review,\xe2\x80\x9d that requiring SCR for a rural Alaska utility would lead to a 20% price increase, and that in comparison with other BACT technologies, SCR came at a \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly higher\xe2\x80\x9d cost.  <em>Ibid.</em>  No economic basis for a comparison between the mine and a rural utility appeared in ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s technical analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA protested the revised permit.  In a September 15, 1999, letter, the Agency stated: \xe2\x80\x9cCominco has not adequately demonstrated any site-specific factors to support their claim that the installation of [SCR] is economically infeasible at the Red Dog Mine.  Therefore, elimination of SCR as BACT based on cost-effectiveness grounds is not supported by the record and is clearly erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 127; see <em>id.</em>, at 138 (ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s record does not support the departure from ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s initial view that the costs for SCR were economically feasible).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To justify the September 1, 1999, permit, EPA suggested, ADEC could \xe2\x80\x9cinclude an analysis of whether requiring Cominco to install and operate [SCR] would have any adverse economic impacts upon Cominco specifically.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 127.  Stating that such an inquiry was unnecessary and expressing \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns related to confidentiality,\xe2\x80\x9d Cominco declined to submit financial data.  <em>Id.</em>, at 134.  In this regard, Cominco simply asserted, without detail, that the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coverall debt remains quite high\xe2\x80\x9d despite continuing profits.  <em>Id.</em>, at 134\xe2\x80\x93135.  Cominco also invoked the need for \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ndustrial development in rural Alaska.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 135.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 10, 1999, ADEC issued the final permit and technical analysis report.  Once again, ADEC approved Low NOx as BACT for MG\xe2\x80\x9317 \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o support Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 208.  ADEC did not include the economic analysis EPA had suggested.  <em>Id.</em>, at 152\xe2\x80\x93246.  Indeed, ADEC conceded again that it had made \xe2\x80\x9cno judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 as to the impact of \xe2\x80\xa6 [SCR\xe2\x80\x99s] cost on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 207.  Nonetheless, ADEC advanced, as cause for its decision, SCR\xe2\x80\x99s adverse effect on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunique and continuing impact on the economic diversity of th[e] region\xe2\x80\x9d and on the venture\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cworld competitiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 208.  ADEC did not explain how its inferences of adverse effects on the region\xe2\x80\x99s economy or the mine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cworld competitiveness\xe2\x80\x9d could be made without financial information showing SCR\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the \xe2\x80\x9coperation, profitability, and competitiveness\xe2\x80\x9d of the mine.  <em>Id.</em>, at 207, 299.  Instead, ADEC reiterated its rural Alaska utility analogy, and again compared SCR\xe2\x80\x99s cost to the costs of other, less stringent, control technologies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 205\xe2\x80\x93207.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same day, December 10, 1999, EPA issued an order to ADEC, under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77413(a)(5) and 7477, prohibiting ADEC from issuing a PSD permit to Cominco \xe2\x80\x9cunless ADEC satisfactorily documents why SCR is not BACT for the Wartsila diesel generator [MG\xe2\x80\x9317].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a.  In the letter accompanying the order, the Agency stated that \xe2\x80\x9cADEC\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis supports the determination that BACT is [SCR], and that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the proposed permit therefore is both arbitrary and erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 149.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 8, 2000, EPA, again invoking its authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act, issued a second order, this time prohibiting Cominco from beginning \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction or modification activities at the Red Dog mine.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  A third order, issued on March 7, 2000, superseding and vacating the February 8 order, generally prohibited Cominco from acting on ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s December 10 PSD permit but allowed limited summer construction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 62a\xe2\x80\x9364a.  On April 25, 2000, EPA withdrew its December 10 order.  App. 300; App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a.  Once ADEC issued the permit, EPA explained, that order lacked utility.  On July 16, 2003, ADEC granted Cominco a PSD permit to construct MG\xe2\x80\x9317 with SCR as BACT.  Letter from Theodore B. Olson, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of the Court (Aug. 21, 2003).  Under the July 16, 2003, permit, SCR ceases to be BACT \xe2\x80\x9cif and when the case currently pending before the Supreme Court of the United States of America is decided in favor of the State of Alaska.\xe2\x80\x9d  ADEC, Air Quality Construction Permit, Final Technical Analysis Report, Permit No. 9932\xe2\x80\x93AC005, Revision 2, p.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The day EPA issued its first order against Cominco, February 8, 2000, ADEC and Cominco petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for review of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s orders.  App. 11.  The Agency initially moved to dismiss, urging that the Court of Appeals lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  In an order released March 27, 2001, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it had adjudicatory authority pursuant to 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(1), which lodges jurisdiction over challenges to \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 final [EPA] action\xe2\x80\x9d in the Courts of Appeals.  <em>Alaska </em>v. <em>United States EPA</em>, 244 F.\xc2\xa03d 748, 750\xe2\x80\x93751.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals resolved the merits in a judgment released July 30, 2002.  298 F.\xc2\xa03d 814 (CA9).  It held that EPA had authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 to issue the contested orders, and that the Agency had properly exercised its discretion in doing so.  <em>Id.,</em> at 820\xe2\x80\x93823.  Concerning EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167, the Court of Appeals observed first that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question presented is what requirements the <em>state</em> must meet\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act to issue a PSD permit, not what the correct BACT might be.  <em>Id.</em>, at 821 (emphasis in original).  Concluding that EPA had \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the state\xe2\x80\x99s justification for its decision,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals emphasized that the \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of a reasoned justification\xe2\x80\x9d by a permitting authority is undeniably a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act.  <em>Ibid.  </em>EPA had properly exercised its discretion in issuing the three orders, the Ninth Circuit ultimately determined, because (1) Cominco failed to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[e] that SCR was economically infeasible,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 823.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77413(a)(5) and 7477.  In notably capacious terms, Congress armed EPA with authority to issue orders stopping construction when \xe2\x80\x9ca State is not acting in compliance with any [CAA] requirement or prohibition \xe2\x80\xa6 relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77413(a)(5), or when \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction or modification of a major emitting facility \xe2\x80\xa6 does not conform to the requirements of [the PSD program],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77477.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal Act enumerates several \xe2\x80\x9c[p]reconstruction requirements\xe2\x80\x9d for the PSD program.  \xc2\xa77475.  Absent these, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o major emitting facility \xe2\x80\xa6 may be constructed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  One express preconstruction requirement is inclusion of a BACT determination in a facility\xe2\x80\x99s PSD permit.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77475(a)(1) and (4).  As earlier set out, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, the Act defines BACT as \xe2\x80\x9can emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of [a] pollutant \xe2\x80\xa6 which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [a] facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).  Under this formulation, the permitting authority, ADEC here, exercises primary or initial responsibility for identifying BACT in line with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of that term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All parties agree that one of the \xe2\x80\x9cmany requirements in the PSD provisions that the EPA may enforce\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthat a [PSD] permit contain a BACT limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 34; see <em>id.</em>, at 22, 25 (same).

In keeping with the broad oversight role \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 vest in EPA, the Agency maintains, it may review permits to ensure that a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination is reasonably moored to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  See <em>id., </em>at 24.  We hold, as elaborated below, that the Agency has rationally construed the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s construction warrants our respect and approbation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BACT\xe2\x80\x99s statutory definition requires selection of an emission control technology that results in the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum\xe2\x80\x9d reduction of a pollutant \xe2\x80\x9cachievable for [a] facility\xe2\x80\x9d in view of \xe2\x80\x9cenergy, environmental, and economic impacts, and other costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

See 298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 821 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe question presented is what requirements the <em>state </em>must meet,\xe2\x80\x9d not what final substantive decision the State must make (emphasis in original)).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, EPA properly inquires whether a BACT determination appears in a PSD permit, Brief for Petitioner 34, but not whether that BACT determination \xe2\x80\x9cwas made on reasonable grounds properly supported on the record,\xe2\x80\x9d 63 Fed.

Congress, however, vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT.  We fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agency from verifying substantive compliance with the BACT provisions and, instead, limit EPA\xe2\x80\x99s superintendence to the insubstantial question whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words \xe2\x80\x9cBACT.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We emphasize, however, that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rendition of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s less than crystalline text leaves the \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting authority\xe2\x80\x9d considerable leeway.

See Brief for Petitioner 25; Reply Brief for Petitioner 6.  Had Congress intended EPA superintendence of BACT determinations, ADEC urges, Congress would have said so expressly by mandating Agency approval of all, not merely some, BACT determinations.  Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s argument overlooks the obvious difference between a statutory <em>requirement</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa77475(a)(8), and a statutory <em>authorization</em>.  Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations, they simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.  EPA recognizes that its authorization to issue a stop order may be exercised only when a state permitting authority\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unreasonable; in contrast, a required approval may be withheld if EPA would come to a different determination on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cEPA acknowledges that states have the primary role in administering and enforcing the various components of the PSD program.  States have been largely successful in this effort, and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in interpretative and enforcement issues is limited to only a small number of cases.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Act imposes a requirement of reasoned justification for a BACT determination, ADEC ultimately argues, such a requirement may be enforced only through state administrative and judicial processes.  Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9338.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  State review of BACT decisions, according to ADEC, allows development of an adequate factual record, properly imposes the burden of persuasion on EPA when it challenges a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination, and promotes certainty.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Unless EPA review of BACT determinations is channeled into state administrative and judicial forums, ADEC suggests, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing to prevent the EPA from invalidating a BACT determination at any time\xe2\x80\x94months, even years, after a permit has been issued.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be unusual, to say the least, for Congress to remit a federal agency enforcing federal law solely to state court.  We decline to read such an uncommon regime into the Act\xe2\x80\x99s silence.  EPA, the expert federal agency charged with enforcing the Act, has interpreted the BACT provisions and its own \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facility\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  See <em>supra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9321.  That rational interpretation, we agree, is surely permissible.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we persuaded by ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s practical concerns.  We see no reason to conclude that an appropriate record generally cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decision\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness.  ADEC contends that, in this very case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit on an incomplete record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 37.  ADEC, however, offers no particulars to back up its assertion that the Court of Appeals proceeded on an inadequate evidentiary record.  We note again that the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record.  298 F. 3d, at 818.  After the Agency declared that the record was complete, \xe2\x80\x9call the parties effectively agreed that the record as it stood was adequate to resolve the issues on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the burdens of production and persuasion, nothing in the Act suggests that EPA gains a proof-related tactical advantage by issuing a stop-construction order instead of seeking relief through a civil action.  But cf. <em>post</em>, at 9 (EPA authority to issue stop-construction orders creates \xe2\x80\x9cthe anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State\xe2\x80\x9d).  Correspondingly, nothing in our decision today invites or permits EPA to achieve an unfair advantage through its choice of litigation forum.  In granting EPA a choice between initiating a civil action and exercising its stop-construction-order authority, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, 26, n.\xc2\xa015, Congress nowhere suggested that the allocation of proof burdens would differ depending upon which enforcement route EPA selected.  The point ought not to be left in doubt.  Accordingly, we hold that in either an EPA-initiated civil action or a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order filed in state or federal court, the production and persuasion burdens remain with EPA and the underlying question a reviewing court resolves remains the same: Whether the state agency\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination was reasonable, in light of the statutory guides and the state administrative record.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 24.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s review of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s order is in keeping with our holding that EPA may not reduce the burden it must carry by electing to invoke its stop-construction-order authority.  Specifically, the Court of Appeals rested its judgment on what EPA showed from ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s own report: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating [to ADEC] that SCR was economically infeasible; and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.\xe2\x80\x9d  298 F. 3d, at 823.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions, and the basis for them, support the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the federal Agency\xe2\x80\x99s grounds for issuing the orders under review were not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrar[y] and capriciou[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Our own analysis, <em>infra</em> at 30\xe2\x80\x9335, similarly hinges on the question whether ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination was a reasonable one.  Our analysis would have taken the same path had EPA initiated a civil action pursuant to \xc2\xa7113(a)(5)(C), or if the suit under consideration had been filed initially in state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we find compelling ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, reiterated by the dissent, that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA would be free to invalidate a BACT determination \xe2\x80\x9cmonths, even years, after a permit has been issued.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 35; <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  This case threatens no such development.  It involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, see <em>supra</em>, at 14, not postconstruction federal Agency directives.  EPA itself regards it as \xe2\x80\x9cimperative\xe2\x80\x9d to act on a timely basis, recognizing that courts are \xe2\x80\x9cless likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the farther planning and construction have progressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 273 (July 15, 1988, EPA guidance memorandum).  In the one instance of untimely EPA action ADEC identifies, the federal courts declined to permit enforcement to proceed.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>AM General Corp.</em>, 34 F.\xc2\xa03d 472, 475 (CA7 1994) (affirming District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of an EPA-initiated enforcement action where EPA did not act until well after the facility received a PSD permit and completed plant modifications).  EPA, we are confident, could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and the dissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to review EPA\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  Cf. <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U.

We credit EPA\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding construction of the Act and confirm EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority, pursuant to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167, to rule on the reasonableness of BACT decisions by state permitting authorities.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn finally, and more particularly, to the reasons why we conclude that EPA properly exercised its statutory authority in this case.  ADEC urges that, even if the Act allows the Agency to issue stop-construction orders when a state permitting authority unreasonably determines BACT, EPA acted impermissibly in this instance.  See Brief for Petitioner 39\xe2\x80\x9348.  We note, first, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s threshold objection.  ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s petition to this Court questioned whether the Act accorded EPA oversight authority with respect to a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination.  Pet. for Cert. 13\xe2\x80\x9322.  ADEC did not present, as a discrete issue, the question whether EPA, assuming it had authority to review the substance of a state BACT determination, nevertheless abused its authority by countermanding ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s permit for the Red Dog Mine expansion.  See Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9345; cf. Reply Brief for Petitioner 15\xe2\x80\x9316, n.\xc2\xa012 (\xe2\x80\x9cEPA asserts authority to overturn only \xe2\x80\x98arbitrary or unreasoned\xe2\x80\x99 state BACT determinations\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Thus, whether the State issued a reasoned justification is \xe2\x80\x98fairly included\xe2\x80\x99 within the question presented[.]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Treating the case-specific issue as embraced within the sole question presented, we are satisfied that EPA did not act arbitrarily in finding that ADEC furnished no tenable accounting for its determination that Low NOx was BACT \nfor MG\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial review in this instance,[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] we apply the familiar default standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A), and ask whether the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s action was \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even when an agency explains its decision with \xe2\x80\x9cless than ideal clarity,\xe2\x80\x9d a reviewing court will not upset the decision on that account \xe2\x80\x9cif the agency\xe2\x80\x99s path may reasonably be discerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowman Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Arkansas&amp;nbhyph;Best Freight System, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/281/index.html">419 U. S. 281</a>, 286 (1974).  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s three skeletal orders to ADEC and Cominco surely are not composed with ideal clarity.  These orders, however, are properly read together with accompanying explanatory correspondence from EPA; so read, the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s comments and orders adequately ground the determination that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Low NOx for MG\xe2\x80\x9317 was unreasonable given the facts ADEC found.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the two draft permits and the final permit, ADEC formally followed the EPA-recommended top-down methodology to determine BACT, as Cominco had done in its application.  App. 61, 109, 175; see <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Employing that methodology in the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically and economically feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 65; see <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  That technology should have been designated BACT absent \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical considerations, or energy, environmental, or economic impacts justif[ying] a conclusion that [SCR was] not \xe2\x80\x98achievable\xe2\x80\x99 in [this] case.\xe2\x80\x9d  New Source Review Manual, p<em>.\xc2\xa0</em>B2; App. 61\xe2\x80\x9362.  ADEC nevertheless selected Low NOx as BACT; ADEC did so in May 1999 based on Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that fitting all Red Dog Mine generators with Low NOx would reduce aggregate emissions.  <em>Id., </em>at 87, 111\xe2\x80\x93112; see <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that it could reduce aggregate emissions by equipping all generators with Low NOx.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  ADEC candidly stated that it aimed \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o support Cominco\xe2\x80\x99s Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 208.  In these second and third rounds, ADEC rested its selection of Low NOx squarely and solely on SCR\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 116; <em>id.</em>, at 112\xe2\x80\x93117, 203\xe2\x80\x93208; <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA concluded that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record.  See App. 138.  In the September and December 1999 technical analyses, ADEC acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cno judgment [could then] be made as to the impact of [SCR\xe2\x80\x99s] cost on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 116, 207.  ADEC nevertheless concluded that SCR would threaten both the Red Dog Mine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunique and continuing impact on the economic diversity\xe2\x80\x9d of northwest Alaska and the mine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cworld competitiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 208.  ADEC also stressed the mine\xe2\x80\x99s role as employer in an area with \xe2\x80\x9chistorical high unemployment and limited permanent year-round job opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 207.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not see how ADEC, having acknowledged that no determination \xe2\x80\x9c[could] be made as to the impact of [SCR\xe2\x80\x99s] cost on the operation \xe2\x80\xa6 and competitiveness of the [mine],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, could simultaneously proffer threats to the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation or competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible.  ADEC, indeed, forthrightly explained why it was disarmed from reaching any judgment on whether, or to what extent, implementation of SCR would adversely affect the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation or profitability: Cominco had declined to provide the relevant financial data, disputing the need for such information and citing \xe2\x80\x9cconfidentiality\xe2\x80\x9d concerns, <em>id.</em>, at 134; see <em>supra</em>, at 13; 298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 823 (\xe2\x80\x9cCominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that SCR was economically infeasible.\xe2\x80\x9d).  No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR for its new generator, would be obliged to cut personnel, or raise zinc prices.  Absent evidence of that order, ADEC lacked cause for selecting Low NOx as BACT based on the more stringent control\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the mine\xe2\x80\x99s operation or competitiveness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice of Low NOx.  To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production; BACT\xe2\x80\x99s cost, in those instances, ranged from $0 to $936 per ton of nitrogen oxide removed.  App. 205\xe2\x80\x93206; <em>supra</em>, at 14.  ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCR\xe2\x80\x99s per-ton cost, then estimated as $2,279, to be \xe2\x80\x9cwell within what ADEC and EPA considers economically feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 84; cf. <em>id.</em>, at 204 (estimating SCR\xe2\x80\x99s per ton cost to be $2,100).  No reasoned explanation for ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s retreat from this position appears in the final permit.  See <em>id.</em>, at 138 (\xe2\x80\x9c[SCR\xe2\x80\x99s cost falls] well within the range of costs EPA has seen permitting authorities nationwide accept as economically feasible for NOx control except where there are compelling site specific factors that indicate otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d).

The State of Alaska had in place procedures that were in full compliance with the governing statute and accompanying regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  As I understand the opinion of the Court and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, there is no disagreement on this point.  Alaska followed these procedures to determine the best available control technology (BACT).  EPA, however, sought to overturn the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision, not by the process of judicial review, but by administrative fiat.  The Court errs, in my judgment, by failing to hold that EPA, based on nothing more than its substantive disagreement with the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary judgment, exceeded its powers in setting aside Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority explains, the case begins with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77413(a)(5), 7477.  These provisions give EPA authority to enforce \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the CAA.  The meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9crequiremen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d though, is not defined in these provisions.  Other provisions of the Act must be consulted.  All parties agree that the requirement in this case is the \xe2\x80\x9cpreconstruction requiremen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the best available technology [BACT] for each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from, or which results from, such facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).  BACT, in turn, is defined as</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9can emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority holds that, under the CAA, state agencies are vested with \xe2\x80\x9cinitial responsibility for identifying BACT in line with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of that term\xe2\x80\x9d and that EPA has a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad oversight role\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably moored to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  The statute, however, contemplates no such arrangement.  It directs the \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting authority\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC)\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d what constitutes BACT.  To \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d is not simply to make an initial recommendation that can later be overturned.  It is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o decide or settle \xe2\x80\xa6 conclusively and authoritatively.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Heritage Dictionary 495<em> </em>(4th ed. 2000).  Cf. 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7554 (\xe2\x80\x9cto be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BACT definition presumes that the permitting authority will exercise discretion.  It presumes, in addition, that the BACT decision will accord full consideration to the statutory factors and other relevant and necessary criteria.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the statute does not direct the State to find as BACT the technology that results in the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum reduction of a pollutant achievable for [a] facility\xe2\x80\x9d in the abstract.  <em>Ante, </em>at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, for a State to do so without regard to the other mandatory criteria would be to ignore the words of the statute.  The Act requires a more comprehensive judgment.  It provides that the permitting authority must \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] into account\xe2\x80\x9d a set of contextual considerations\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cenergy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to identify the best control technology \xe2\x80\x9con a case-by-case basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77479(3).  The majority reaches its narrow view of the scope of the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion only by wresting two adjectives, \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cachievable,\xe2\x80\x9d out of context.  In doing so, it ignores \xe2\x80\x9cthe cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>King</em> v. <em>St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/index.html">502 U. S. 215</a>, 221 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 authorize EPA to enforce requirements of the Act.  These provisions, however, do not limit the States\xe2\x80\x99 latitude and responsibility to balance all the statutory factors in making their discretionary judgments.  If a State has complied with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167 are not implicated and can supply no separate basis for EPA to exercise a supervisory role over a State\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decision.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had it altogether backwards when it reasoned that, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause neither Section 113(a)(5) nor Section 167 contains any exemption for requirements that involve the state\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d EPA had the authority to issue orders countermanding the State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination.  298 F.\xc2\xa03d 814, 820 (2002).  The question is not whether the two sections contain any exemption.  Rather, it is about the nature of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements and whether EPA has the authority to set aside a BACT determination when no requirement of the Act was violated in the first place.  In affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the majority repeats the same analytical error.  See<em> ante,</em> at 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agency from verifying substantive compliance with [BACT] \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  When the statute is read as a whole, it is clear that the CAA commits BACT determinations to the discretion of the relevant permitting authorities.  Unless an objecting party, including EPA, prevails on judicial review, the determinations are conclusive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the state agency, ADEC, recognized it was required to make a BACT determination.  It issued two detailed reports in response to comments by interested parties and concluded that Low Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) was BACT.  The requirement that the agency weigh the list of statutory factors, study all other relevant considerations, and decide the technology that can best reduce pollution within practical constraints was met in full.  As even EPA acknowledged, ADEC \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ed] a detailed accounting of the process.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 286.  This is not a case, then, where the state agency failed to have a BACT review procedure in place or altogether refused to apply the statute\xe2\x80\x99s formal requirements.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s only quarrel is with ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s substantive conclusion.  In disagreeing with ADEC, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s sole contention, in the section of its order titled \xe2\x80\x9cFindings of <em>Fact</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d is that \xe2\x80\x9cSCR is BACT.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a, 34a (emphasis added).  In addition, EPA does not allege that using Low NOx would violate other CAA requirements, such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increments, or other applicable emission standards, see<em> </em>42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(3).  On this state of the record there is no deviation from any statutory \xe2\x80\x9crequirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a result, EPA has no statutory basis to invoke the enforcement authority of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113(a)(5) and 167.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Congress intends to give EPA general supervisory authority, it says so in clear terms.  In addition to requiring EPA\xe2\x80\x99s advance approval of BACT determinations in some instances,  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(8), the statute grants EPA powers to block the construction or operation of polluting sources in circumstances not at issue here, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77426(b), (c)(1), 7410(a)(2)(D)(i).  Outside the context of the CAA, Congress likewise knows how to establish federal oversight in unambiguous language.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(a)(13)(A) (1994 ed.) (requiring, under the Medicaid Act, reimbursement according to rates that a \xe2\x80\x9cState finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services], are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Wilder</em> v. <em>Virginia Hospital Assn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/index.html">496 U. S. 498</a> (1990).  No analogous language is used in the statutory definition of BACT.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA insists it needs oversight authority to prevent a \xe2\x80\x9crace to the bottom,\xe2\x80\x9d where jurisdictions compete with each other to lower environmental standards to attract new industries and keep existing businesses within their borders.  Whatever the merits of these arguments as a general matter, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of state agencies is inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s clear mandate that States bear the primary role in controlling pollution and, here, the exclusive role in making BACT determinations.  In \xe2\x80\x9ccho[osing] not to dictate a Federal response to balancing sometimes conflicting goals\xe2\x80\x9d at the expense of \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aximum flexibility and State discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93294, p.\xc2\xa0146 (1977), Congress made the overriding judgment that States are more responsive to local conditions and can strike the right balance between preserving environmental quality and advancing competing objectives.  By assigning certain functions to the States, Congress assumed they would have a stake in implementing the environmental objectives of the Act.  At the same time, Congress charged EPA with setting ambient standards and enforcing emission limits, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(3), to ensure that the Nation takes the necessary steps to reduce air pollution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The presumption that state agencies are not to be trusted to do their part is unwarranted in another respect: EPA itself said so.  As EPA concedes, States, by and large, take their statutory responsibility seriously, and EPA sees no reason to intervene in the vast majority of cases.  Brief for Respondents 30, n.\xc2\xa09; 57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cStates have been largely successful in [\xe2\x80\x98administering and enforcing the various components of the PSD program\xe2\x80\x99], and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in interpretative and enforcement issues is limited \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  In light of this concession, EPA and <em>amici</em> not only fail to overcome the established presumption that States act in good faith, see<em> Alden</em> v. <em>Maine, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a>, 755 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are unwilling to assume the States will refuse to honor \xe2\x80\xa6 or obey the binding laws of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d), but also admit that their fears about a race to the bottom bear little relation to the real-world experience under the statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe see no reason not to take EPA at its word\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute contains safeguards to correct arbitrary and capricious BACT decisions when they do occur.  Before EPA approves a State\xe2\x80\x99s PSD permit program that allows a state agency to make BACT determinations, EPA must be satisfied that the State provides \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity for state judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  61 Fed. Reg. 1882 (1996).  Furthermore, before an individual permit may issue, the State must allow all \xe2\x80\x9cinterested persons,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9crepresentatives of the [EPA] Administrator,\xe2\x80\x9d to submit comments on, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol technology requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(2).  To facilitate EPA\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the State\xe2\x80\x99s public comment process, the statute further provides that specific procedures be followed to inform the EPA Administrator of \xe2\x80\x9cevery action\xe2\x80\x9d taken in the course of the permit approval process.  \xc2\xa77475(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cEach State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of each permit application relating to a major emitting facility received by such State and provide notice to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of such permit\xe2\x80\x9d).  Any person who participated in the comment process can pursue an administrative appeal of the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision, followed, as mentioned, by judicial review in state courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA followed none of the normal procedures here.  Only after the period for public comments expired did it intervene and seek to overturn Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s decision that Low NOx was BACT.  To justify its decision to opt out of the State\xe2\x80\x99s administrative and judicial review process and, instead, to issue a unilateral order after everyone had spoken, EPA complains that it has not before intervened in \xe2\x80\x9cany State administrative review proceedings in State courts\xe2\x80\x9d and should not now be forced to do so.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.  With scant analysis, the majority agrees.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be unusual, to say the least, for Congress to remit a federal agency enforcing federal law solely to state court.  We decline to read such an uncommon regime into the Act\xe2\x80\x99s silence\xe2\x80\x9d).  The problem, of course, is that it is all the more unusual to allow a federal agency to take unilateral action to set aside a State\xe2\x80\x99s administrative decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite EPA\xe2\x80\x99s protestations, the statute makes explicit provision for EPA to challenge a state agency\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination in state proceedings.  The statute requires States to set up an administrative process for \xe2\x80\x9cinterested persons\xe2\x80\x9d to submit comments.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(2).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]nterested persons,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress took care to note, include \xe2\x80\x9crepresentatives of the [EPA] Administrator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa746.14.990(20) (2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9can agency of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that EPA itself requires, as a condition of approving a State\xe2\x80\x99s PSD program, that this process culminate in judicial review in state courts, 61 Fed. Reg., at 1882, it follows that EPA, a subset of all \xe2\x80\x9cinterested persons,\xe2\x80\x9d must take the same procedural steps and cannot evade the more painstaking state process by a mere stroke of the pen under the agency\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On a more fundamental level, EPA and the majority confuse a substantive environmental statute like the CAA with a general administrative law statute like the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  EPA, the federal agency charged only with the CAA\xe2\x80\x99s implementation, has no roving commission to ferret out arbitrary and capricious conduct by state agencies under the state equivalent of the APA.  That task is left to state courts.  See<em> Idaho</em> v. <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe of Idaho,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/261/index.html">521 U. S. 261</a>, 276 (1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he elaboration of administrative law \xe2\x80\xa6 is one of the primary responsibilities of the state judiciary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like federal courts, state courts are charged with reviewing agency actions to ensure that they comport with principles of rationality and due process.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A); Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa744.62.570(b)(3) (2002).  Counsel for respondents were unable to identify, either in their briefs or at oral argument, a single State that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not have in its law the requirement that its own agencies \xe2\x80\xa6 act rationally.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 30.  Although it remains an open question whether EPA can bypass the state judiciary and go directly into federal district court under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71345, the availability of state judicial review defeats the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, absent EPA\xe2\x80\x99s oversight, there is a legal vacuum where BACT decisions are not subject to review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Requiring EPA to seek administrative and judicial review of a State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination, instead of allowing it to be overturned by fiat, avoids the anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State.  Whether the BACT decision is reviewed in state court, or in federal district court if that option is available,<em> </em>see <em>supra</em>, at 8, EPA, as petitioner, bears the initial burden and costs of filing a petition for review alleging that the State acted arbitrarily.  Under the scheme endorsed by the majority today, the tables are turned.  Once EPA has issued an enforcement order, and the State seeks to invalidate that order, the State bears the burden of alleging that EPA acted arbitrarily.  EPA and the majority concede that, because States enjoy substantial discretion in making BACT determinations, courts reviewing EPA\xe2\x80\x99s order must ask not simply whether EPA acted arbitrarily but the convoluted question whether EPA acted arbitrarily in finding the State acted arbitrarily.  Even under this unwieldy standard of review, and even if the burdens of persuasion and production remain with EPA, see <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, the initial burden of pleading and litigation now belongs to the State.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To make its decision more palatable, the majority holds that EPA still bears the burdens of production and persuasion, but there is little authority for this.  The Court purports to rely on McCormick on Evidence for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98looking for the burden of pleading is not a foolproof guide to the allocation of burdens of proof.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28, n.\xc2\xa017 (quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7337, pp. 411\xe2\x80\x93412 (5th ed. 1999)).  The example\xe2\x80\x94affirmative defense\xe2\x80\x94discussed in that passage of the treatise, however, is far afield from the issues raised in this case.  In fact, the treatise instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n most cases, the party who has the burden of pleading a fact will have the burdens of producing evidence and of persuading the jury of its existence as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 411.  This is because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.  In this case, EPA changed the <em>status quo ante</em> by issuing an order invalidating ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Without upsetting accepted evidentiary principles, the majority cannot explain why EPA, as respondent in federal court\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the State, as petitioner alleging that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>fait accompli</em> was arbitrary\xe2\x80\x94should bear the burdens of persuasion and production, or how this unusual reallocation of burdens should work in practice.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, even the majority accepts that, under its reading of the statute, the State now bears the burden of pleading.  With this burden-shifting benefit alone, EPA is most unlikely to follow the procedure, prescribed by federal law, of participating in the State\xe2\x80\x99s administrative process and seeking judicial review in state courts.  Instead, EPA can simply issue a unilateral order invalidating the State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination and put the burden on the State to challenge EPA\xe2\x80\x99s order.  This end run around the State\xe2\x80\x99s process is sure to undermine it.  Unless Congress was on a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand, the loophole the majority finds goes only to demonstrate the inconsistency between its approach and the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a further, and serious, flaw in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  Suppose, before EPA issued its orders setting aside the State\xe2\x80\x99s BACT determination, an Alaska state court had reviewed the matter and found no error of law or abuse of discretion in ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute would allow EPA to intervene at this point for the first time, announce that ADEC\xe2\x80\x99s determination is unreasoned under the CAA, and issue its own orders nullifying the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  This reworking of the balance between State and Federal Governments, not to mention the reallocation of authority between the Executive and Judicial Branches, shows the implausibility of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a federal agency were to exercise an analogous power to review the decisions of federal courts, the arrangement would violate the well-established rule that the judgments of Article III courts cannot be revised by the Executive or Legislative Branches.  See <em>Hayburn\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 2 Dall. 409, 410, n. (1792) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[B]y the Constitution, neither the Secretary [of] War, nor any other Executive officer, nor even the Legislature, are authorized to sit as a court of errors on \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial acts or opinions \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Plaut</em> v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/211/index.html">514 U. S. 211</a> (1995).  The principle that judicial decisions cannot be reopened at the whim of the Executive or the Legislature is essential to preserving separation of powers and judicial independence.  Judges cannot, without sacrificing the autonomy of their office, put onto the scales of justice some predictive judgment about the probability that an administrator might reverse their rulings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today denies state judicial systems the same judicial independence it has long guarded for itself\xe2\x80\x94only that the injury here is worse.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, decisions by state courts would be subject to being overturned, not just by any agency, but by an agency established by a different sovereign.  We should be reluctant to interpret a congressional statute to deny to States the judicial independence guaranteed by their own constitutions.  See<em> Buckalew</em> v. <em>Holloway</em>, 604 P.\xc2\xa02d 240, 245 (Alaska 1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that judicial independence was a paramount concern of the delegates [to the Alaska Constitutional Convention]\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> Cal. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa73 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial.  Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by this Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 7 B.  Witkin, Summary of California Law 159\xe2\x80\x93160 (9th ed. 1988) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Under] the principle of separation of powers \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, one [department] cannot exercise or interfere with the functions of either of the others\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Federal Government is free, within its vast legislative authority, to impose federal standards.  For States to have a role, however, their own governing processes must be respected.  <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a> (1992).  If, by some course of reasoning, state courts must live with the insult that their judgments can be revised by a federal agency, the Court should at least insist upon a clear instruction from Congress.  That directive cannot be found here.  Cf. <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/452/index.html">501 U. S. 452</a>, 460 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a final deficiency in the scheme the majority finds in the statute.  Nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis prevents EPA from issuing an order setting aside a BACT determination months, or even years, later.  Congress cannot have intended this result.  After all, when Congress provides for EPA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, it directs the agency to act sooner rather than later by establishing a pre-authorization procedure.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77475(a)(8).  The majority misses the point when it faults ADEC for \xe2\x80\x9coverlook[ing] the obvious difference between a statutory requirement \xe2\x80\xa6 and a statutory authorization.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 25 (emphasis deleted).  ADEC does not overlook the difference between approval before the fact and oversight after the fact.  Rather, ADEC, unlike the majority, recognizes that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s explicit provision for a preauthorization process underscores the need for finality in state permitting decisions, making implausible an interpretation of the statute that would allow a <em>post hoc</em> veto procedure that upsets the same reliance and expectation interests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s initial response that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case threatens no such development [because] [i]t involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, not postconstruction federal Agency directives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 29, provides no assurance that the logic of its reasoning would not in the future allow EPA\xe2\x80\x99s belated interventions.  When the majority confronts the problem, it concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cEPA, we are confident, could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and the dissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to review EPA\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The authority it cites for this proposition, however, consists of nothing more than a religious exemption case that is far removed from the issues presented here and a dissent from a case that has been overruled in part.  <em>Ibid.</em>  State agencies rely on this dictum at their own risk.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reassurance to the States will likely be to no avail.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe principle that the United States are not bound by any statute of limitations, nor barred by any laches of their officers, however gross, in a suit brought by them as a sovereign Government to enforce a public right, or to assert a public interest, is established past all controversy or doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Beebe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/127/338/index.html">127 U. S. 338</a>, 344 (1888); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Summerlin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/414/index.html">310 U. S. 414</a>, 416 (1940) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well settled that the United States is not bound by state statutes of limitation or subject to the defense of laches in enforcing its rights\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/243/389/index.html">243 U. S. 389</a>, 409 (1917) (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]aches or neglect of duty on the part of officers of the Government is no defense to a suit by it to enforce a public right or protect a public interest\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0A suit by the United States to enforce and maintain its policy \xe2\x80\xa6 stands upon a different plane in this and some other respects from the ordinary private suit \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 167, moreover, is mandatory.  Once a violation of a statutory \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d is found, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Administrator shall \xe2\x80\xa6 take such measures, including issuance of an order, or seeking injunctive relief, as necessary to prevent the construction or modification of a major emitting facility which does not conform to the requirements of this part \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77477.  In short, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement authority can\xe2\x80\x94indeed, must\xe2\x80\x94be exercised at any point.  In light of our precedents a court would be hard pressed to hold otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seeks to limit the consequence of its holding by quoting the response by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel at oral argument that ADEC could \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d arrive at the same BACT determination if only it would pile on another layer of procedure and justify its decision on an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appropriate record.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 36 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 35).  As the Court of Appeals recognized in a prior case, however, this option gives no solace to the States:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0The hardship is the process itself.  Process costs money.  If a federal licensee must spend years attempting to satisfy an elaborate, shifting array of state procedural requirements, then he must borrow a fortune to pay lawyers, economists, accountants, archaeologists, historians, engineers, recreational consultants, environmental consultants, biologists and others, with no revenue, no near-term prospect of revenue, and no certainty that there ever will be revenue.  Meanwhile, politics, laws, interest rates, construction costs, and costs of alternatives change.  Undue process may impose cost and uncertainty sufficient to thwart the federal determination that a power project should proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sayles Hydro Associates </em>v. <em>Maughan</em>, 985 F.\xc2\xa02d 451, 454 (CA9 1993).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf there is to be a second look, notwithstanding the 18 months ADEC spent analyzing BACT, a third or fourth look is just as permissible.  The majority creates a sort of Zeno\xe2\x80\x99s paradox for state agencies.  Because there can always be an additional procedure to ensure that the preceding process was followed, no matter how many steps States take toward the objective, they may never reach it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a most regrettable result.  In the proper discharge of their responsibilities to implement the CAA in different conditions and localities nationwide, the States maintain permanent staffs within special agencies.  These state employees, who no doubt take pride in their own resourcefulness, expertise, and commitment to the law, are the officials directed by Congress to make case-by-case, site-specific, determinations under the Act.  Regulated persons and entities should be able to consult an agency staff with certainty and confidence, giving due consideration to agency recommendations and guidance.  After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, a state agency can no longer represent itself as the real governing body.  No matter how much time was spent in consultation and negotiation, a single federal administrator can in the end set all aside by a unilateral order.  This is a great step backward in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 design to grant States a significant stake in developing and enforcing national environmental objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If EPA were to announce that permit applications subject to BACT review must be submitted to it in the first instance and can be forwarded to the State only with EPA\xe2\x80\x99s advance approval, I should assume even the majority would find the basic structure of the BACT provisions undercut.  In practical terms, however, the majority displaces state agencies, and degrades their role, in much the same way.  In the case before us the applicant made elaborate submissions to ADEC.  For over a year and a half, there ensued the constructive discourse that is the very object of the agency process, with both the ADEC staff and the applicant believing the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision would be dispositive.  EPA did not participate in the administrative process, but waited until after the record was closed to intervene by issuing an order setting aside the BACT determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are advised that an applicant sometimes must spend up to $500,000 on the permit process and that, for a complex project, the time for approval can take from five to seven years.  Brief for National Environmental Development Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8.  Under the new multiple-tiered process, permit expenditures become less justified, state officials less credible, reliance less certain.  The Court should be under no illusion that its decision respects the State\xe2\x80\x99s administrative process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal balance is remitted, in many instances, to Congress.  Here the Court remits it to a single agency official.  This is inconsistent with the assurance Congress gave to regulated entities when it allowed state agencies to decide upon the grant or denial of a permit under the BACT provisions of the CAA.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end EPA appears to realize the weakness of its arguments and asks us simply to defer to its expertise in light of the purported statutory ambiguity.  See<em> </em>Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9343 (asking for deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)).  To its credit, the majority holds <em>Chevron </em>deference inapplicable.  Deference is inappropriate for all the reasons the majority recites, <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, plus one more: The statute is not in any way ambiguous. As a result, our inquiry should proceed no further.</p>\n<p align="left"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Actions, however, speak louder than words, and the majority ends up giving EPA the very <em>Chevron </em>deference\xe2\x80\x94and more\xe2\x80\x94it says should be denied.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is chock full of <em>Chevron</em>-like language.  Compare 467 U. S., at 843 (\xe2\x80\x9cwhether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 845 (\xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s view \xe2\x80\xa6 is a reasonable one\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>ante</em>, at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9c[EPA\xe2\x80\x99s] arguments do not persuade us to reject [them] as impermissible\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante,</em> at 27 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0That rational interpretation, we agree, is surely permissible\xe2\x80\x9d).  So deficient are its statutory arguments that the majority must hide behind <em>Chevron</em>\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary, despite its explicit holding that <em>Chevron</em> does not apply.  In applying <em>Chevron</em> <em>de facto</em> under these circumstances, however, the majority undermines the well-established distinction our precedents draw between <em>Chevron</em> and less deferential forms of judicial review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The broader implication of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is more unfortunate still.  The CAA is not the only statute that relies on a close and equal partnership between federal and state authorities to accomplish congressional objectives.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 505 U. S., at 167 (listing examples).  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, these other statutes, too, could be said to confer on federal agencies ultimate decisionmaking authority, relegating States to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, instead of coequal sovereigns entitled to the same dignity and respect.  Cf.<em> Alden</em> v. <em>Maine, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a> (1999).  If cooperative federalism, <em>Hodel</em> v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/index.html">452 U. S. 264</a>, 289 (1981), is to achieve Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of allowing state governments to be accountable to the democratic process in implementing environmental policies, federal agencies cannot consign States to the ministerial tasks of information gathering and making initial recommendations, while reserving to themselves the authority to make final judgments under the guise of surveillance and oversight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, and with all respect, I dissent from the opinion and the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
