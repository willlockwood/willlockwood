To grant such an application would bring "the entire matter in controversy" before the Court for decision.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(3).</p>\n<p>Since the certificate must be dismissed, the Court should not exercise its discretionary power to bring up "the entire matter in controversy" for review.  <em>See Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. v.

Perhaps the Court of Appeals may now wish to hear this case en banc to resolve the deadlock indicated in the certificate and give full review to the entire case.  This Court does not normally review orders of administrative agencies in the first instances, and the Court does not desire to take any action at this time which might foreclose the possibility of such review in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the Board\'s application is denied.</p>\n<p>MR.
