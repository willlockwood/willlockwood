First, as required by the State\xe2\x80\x99s Top Ten Percent Law, it offers admission to any students who graduate from a Texas high school in the top 10% of their class.  It then fills the remainder of its incoming freshman class, some 25%, by combining an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAcademic Index\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the student\xe2\x80\x99s SAT score and high school academic performance\xe2\x80\x94with the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal Achievement Index,\xe2\x80\x9d a holistic review containing numerous factors, including race.  The University adopted its current admissions process in 2004, after a year-long-study of its admissions process\xe2\x80\x94undertaken in the wake of <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306\n, and <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n\xe2\x80\x94led it to conclude that its prior race-neutral system did not reach its goal of providing the educational benefits of diversity to its undergraduate students. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioner Abigail Fisher, who was not in the top 10% of her high school class, was denied admission to the University\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 freshman class.  She filed suit, alleging that the University\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race as part of its holistic-review process disadvantaged her and other Caucasian applicants, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The District Court entered summary judgment in the University\xe2\x80\x99s favor, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  This Court vacated the judgment, <i>Fisher</i> v. <i>University of Tex. at Austin</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (<i>Fisher I</i>), and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, so the University\xe2\x80\x99s program could be evaluated under the proper strict scrutiny standard.  On remand, the Fifth Circuit again affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the University.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The race-conscious admissions program in use at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"> (a)\xc2\xa0<i>Fisher I</i> sets out three controlling principles relevant to assessing the constitutionality of a public university\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative action program.  First, a university may not consider race \xe2\x80\x9cunless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, it must show that its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to accomplish that purpose.  570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___<i>.  </i>Second, \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at ___.  Third, when determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the university\xe2\x80\x99s permissible goals, the school bears the burden of demonstrating that \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crace-neutral alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d do not suffice.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The University\xe2\x80\x99s approach to admissions gives rise to an unusual consequence here.  The component with the largest impact on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s chances of admission was not the school\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race under its holistic-review process but the Top Ten Percent Plan.  Because petitioner did not challenge the percentage part of the plan, the record is devoid of evidence of its impact on diversity.  Remand for further factfinding would serve little purpose, however, because at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application, the current plan had been in effect only three years and, in any event, the University lacked authority to alter the percentage plan, which was mandated by the Texas Legislature.  These circumstances refute any criticism that the University did not make good faith efforts to comply with the law.  The University, however, does have a continuing obligation to satisfy the strict scrutiny burden: by periodically reassessing the admission program\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality, and efficacy, in light of the school\xe2\x80\x99s experience and the data it has gathered since adopting its admissions plan, and by tailoring its approach to ensure that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interests.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"> (c)\xc2\xa0Drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment at the time her application was rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Petitioner claims that the University has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity because it has failed to state more precisely what level of minority enrollment would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students, but an interest in obtaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Since the University is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient.  A university\xe2\x80\x99s goals cannot be elusory or amorphous\xe2\x80\x94they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.  The record here reveals that the University articulated concrete and precise goals\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g., </i>ending stereotypes, promoting \xe2\x80\x9ccross-racial understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d preparing students for \xe2\x80\x9can increasingly diverse workforce and society,\xe2\x80\x9d and cultivating leaders with \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that mirror the compelling interest this Court has approved in prior cases.  It also gave a \xe2\x80\x9creasoned, principled explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for its decision, <i>id., </i>at ___, in a 39-page proposal written after a year-long study revealed that its race-neutral policies and programs did not meet its goals.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Petitioner also claims that the University need not consider race because it had already \xe2\x80\x9cachieved critical mass\xe2\x80\x9d by 2003 under the Top Ten Percent Plan and race-neutral holistic review.  The record, however, reveals that the University studied and deliberated for months, concluding that race-neutral programs had not achieved the University\xe2\x80\x99s diversity goals, a conclusion supported by significant statistical and anecdotal evidence.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues further that it was unnecessary to consider race because such consideration had only a minor impact on the number of minority students the school admitted.  But the record shows that the consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on freshman class diversity.  That race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.  P.\xc2\xa015.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(4)\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner argues that there were numerous other race-neutral means to achieve the University\xe2\x80\x99s goals.  However, as the record reveals, none of those alternatives was a workable means of attaining the University\xe2\x80\x99s educational goals, as of the time of her application.

Until 1996, the University made its admissions decisions primarily based on a measure called \xe2\x80\x9cAcademic Index\xe2\x80\x9d (or AI), which it calculated by combining an applicant\xe2\x80\x99sSAT score and academic performance in high school.  In assessing applicants, preference was given to racialminorities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1996, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit invalidated this admissions system, holding that any consideration of race in college admissions violates the Equal Protection Clause.  See <i>Hopwood</i> v. <i>Texas</i>, 78 F. 3d 932, 934\xe2\x80\x93935, 948.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One year later the University adopted a new admissions policy.  Instead of considering race, the University began making admissions decisions based on an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI and his or her \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal Achievement Index\xe2\x80\x9d (PAI).  The PAI was a numerical score based on a holistic review of an application.  Included in the number were the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s essays, leadership and work experience, extracurricular activities, community service, and other \xe2\x80\x9cspecial characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d that might give the admissions committee insight into a student\xe2\x80\x99s background. Consistent with <i>Hopwood</i>, race was not a consideration in calculating an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI or PAI.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas Legislature responded to <i>Hopwood</i> as well.  It enacted H. B. 588, commonly known as the Top Ten Percent Law.  Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa751.803 (West Cum. Supp. 2015).  As its name suggests, the Top Ten Percent Law guarantees college admission to students who graduate from a Texas high school in the top 10 percent of their class.  Those students may choose to attend any of the public universities in the State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The University implemented the Top Ten Percent Law in 1998.  After first admitting any student who qualified for admission under that law, the University filled the remainder of its incoming freshman class using a combination of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI and PAI scores\xe2\x80\x94again, without considering race.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The University used this admissions system until 2003, when this Court decided the companion cases of <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306\n, and <i>Gratz </i>v. <i>Bollinger</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n.  In <i>Gratz</i>, this Court<i> </i>struck down the University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate system of admissions, which at the time allocated predetermined points to racial minority candidates.  See 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255, 275\xe2\x80\x93276.  In <i>Grutter</i>, however, the Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School\xe2\x80\x99s system of holistic review\xe2\x80\x94a system that did not mechanically assign points but rather treated race as a relevant feature within the broader context of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s application.  See 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 337, 343\xe2\x80\x93344.  In upholding this nuanced use of race, <i>Grutter</i> implicitly overruled <i>Hopwood</i>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical prohibition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the wake of <i>Grutter</i>, the University embarked upon a year-long study seeking to ascertain whether its admissions policy was allowing it to provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits of a diverse student body\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0to all of the University\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate students.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 481a\xe2\x80\x93482a (affidavit of N. Bruce Walker \xc2\xb611 (Walker Aff.)); see also <i>id.,</i> at 445a\xe2\x80\x93447a.  The University concluded that its admissions policy was not providing these benefits.  Supp. App. 24a\xe2\x80\x9325a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To change its system, the University submitted a proposal to the Board of Regents that requested permission to begin taking race into consideration as one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe many ways in which [an] academically qualified individual might contribute to, and benefit from, the rich, diverse, and challenging educational environment of the Univer-sity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 23a.  After the board approved the proposal, the University adopted a new admissions policy to implement it.  The University has continued to use that admissions policy to this day.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the University\xe2\x80\x99s new admissions policy was a direct result of <i>Grutter</i>, it is not identical to the policy this Court approved in that case.  Instead, consistent with the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative directive, the University continues to fill a significant majority of its class through the Top Ten Percent Plan (or Plan).  Today, up to 75 percent of the places in the freshman class are filled through the Plan.  As a practical matter, this 75 percent cap, which has now been fixed by statute, means that, while the Plan continues to be referenced as a \xe2\x80\x9cTop Ten Percent Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d a student actually needs to finish in the top seven or eight percent of his or her class in order to be admitted under this category.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The University did adopt an approach similar to the one in <i>Grutter </i>for the remaining 25 percent or so of the incoming class.  This portion of the class continues to be admitted based on a combination of their AI and PAI scores.  Now, however, race is given weight as a subfactor within the PAI.  The PAI is a number from 1 to 6 (6 is the best) that is based on two primary components.  The first component is the average score a reader gives the applicant on two required essays.  The second component is a full-file review that results in another 1-to-6 score, the \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal Achievement Score\xe2\x80\x9d or PAS.  The PAS is determined by a separate reader, who (1) rereads the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s required essays, (2) reviews any supplemental information the applicant submits (letters of recommendation, resumes, an additional optional essay, writing samples, artwork, etc.), and (3) evaluates the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s potential contributions to the University\xe2\x80\x99s student body based on the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s leadership experience, extracurricular activities, awards/honors, community service, and other \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cSpecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d include the socioeconomic status of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s family, the socioeconomic status of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s school, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s family responsibilities, whether the applicant lives in a single-parent home, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s SAT score in relation to the average SAT score at the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s school, the language spoken at the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s home, and, finally, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  See App. 218a\xe2\x80\x93220a, 430a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both the essay readers and the full-file readers who assign applicants their PAI undergo extensive training to ensure that they are scoring applicants consistently.  Deposition of Brian Breman 9\xe2\x80\x9314, Record in No. 1: 08\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300263, (WD Tex.), Doc. 96\xe2\x80\x933.  The Admissions Office also undertakes regular \xe2\x80\x9creliability analyses\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmeasure the frequency of readers scoring within one point of each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 474a (affidavit of Gary M. Lavergne \xc2\xb68); see also <i>id.,</i> at 253a (deposition of Kedra Ishop (Ishop Dep.)).  Both the intensive training and the reliability analyses aim to ensure that similarly situated applicants are being treated identically regardless of which admissions officer reads the file.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Once the essay and full-file readers have calculated each applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI and PAI scores, admissions officers from each school within the University set a cutoff PAI/AI score combination for admission, and then admit all of the applicants who are above that cutoff point.  In setting the cutoff, those admissions officers only know how many applicants received a given PAI/AI score combination.  They do not know what factors went into calculating those applicants\xe2\x80\x99 scores.  The admissions officers who make the final decision as to whether a particular applicant will be admitted make that decision without knowing the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  Race enters the admissions process, then, at one stage and one stage only\xe2\x80\x94the calculation of the PAS.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Therefore, although admissions officers can consider race as a positive feature of a minority student\xe2\x80\x99s application, there is no dispute that race is but a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor of a factor of a factor\xe2\x80\x9d in the holistic-review calculus.  645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 587, 608 (WD Tex. 2009).  Furthermore, consideration of race is contextual and does not operate as a mechanical plus factor for underrepresented minorities.  <i>Id.</i>, at 606 (\xe2\x80\x9cPlaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial groups other than African-Americans and Hispanics are <i>excluded</i> from benefitting from UT\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in admissions.  As the Defendants point out, the consideration of race, within the full context of the entire application, may be beneficial to any UT Austin applicant\xe2\x80\x94including whites and Asian-Americans\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12 (the contention that the University discriminates against Asian-Americans is \xe2\x80\x9centirely unsupported by evidence in the record or empirical data\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is also no dispute, however, that race, when considered in conjunction with other aspects of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s background, can alter an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s PAS score.  Thus, race, in this indirect fashion, considered with all of the other factors that make up an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI and PAI scores, can make a difference to whether an application is accepted or rejected.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner Abigail Fisher applied for admission to the University\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 freshman class.  She was not in the top 10 percent of her high school class, so she was evaluated for admission through holistic, full-file review.

A university cannot impose a fixed quota or otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cdefine diversity as \xe2\x80\x98some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Once, however, a university gives \xe2\x80\x9ca reasoned, principled explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for its decision, deference must be given \xe2\x80\x9cto the University\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, based on its experience and expertise, that a diverse student body would serve its educational goals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, <i>Fisher I </i>clarified that no deference is owed when determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the university\xe2\x80\x99s permissible goals.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at ___ (slip op., at 10).  A university, <i>Fisher I </i>explained, bears the burden of proving a \xe2\x80\x9cnonracial approach\xe2\x80\x9d would not promote its interest in the educational benefits of diversity \xe2\x80\x9cabout as well and at tolerable administrative expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Though \xe2\x80\x9c[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crequire a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence [and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Grutter</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339, it does impose \xe2\x80\x9con the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9crace-neutral alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d that are both \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdo not suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Fisher I</i> set forth these controlling principles, while taking no position on the constitutionality of the admissions program at issue in this case.  The Court held only that the District Court and the Court of Appeals had \xe2\x80\x9cconfined the strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring to the University\xe2\x80\x99s good faith in its use of racial classifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 12)  The Court remanded the case, with instructions to evaluate the record under the correct standard and to determine whether the University had made \xe2\x80\x9ca showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve\xe2\x80\x9d the educational benefits that flow from diversity.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 13).  On remand, the Court of Appeals determined that the program conformed with the strict scrutiny mandated by <i>Fisher I</i>.  See 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 659\xe2\x80\x93660.  Judge Garzadissented.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The University\xe2\x80\x99s program is <i>sui generis</i>.  Unlike other approaches to college admissions considered by this Court, it combines holistic review with a percentage plan.  This approach gave rise to an unusual consequence in this case: The component of the University\xe2\x80\x99s admissions policy that had the largest impact on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s chances of admission was not the school\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race under its holistic-review process but rather the Top Ten Percent Plan.  Because petitioner did not graduate in the top 10 percent of her high school class, she was categorically ineligible for more than three-fourths of the slots in the incoming freshman class.  It seems quite plausible, then, to think that petitioner would have had a better chance of being admitted to the University if the school used race-conscious holistic review to select its entire incoming class, as was the case in <i>Grutter</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite the Top Ten Percent Plan\xe2\x80\x99s outsized effect on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s chances of admission, she has not challenged it.  For that reason, throughout this litigation, the Top Ten Percent Plan has been taken, somewhat artificially, as a given premise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the Top Ten Percent Plan complicates this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.  In particular, it has led to a record that is almost devoid of information about the students who secured admission to the University through the Plan.  The Court thus cannot know how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In an ordinary case, this evidentiary gap perhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court for further factfinding.  When petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application was rejected, however, the University\xe2\x80\x99s combined percentage-plan/holistic-review approach to admission had been in effect for just three years.  While studies undertaken over the eight years since then may be of significant value in determining the constitutionality of the University\xe2\x80\x99s current admissions policy, that evidence has little bearing on whether petitioner received equal treatment when her application was rejected in 2008.  If the Court were to remand, therefore, further factfinding would be limited to a narrow 3-year sample, review of which might yield little insight.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, as discussed above, the University lacks any authority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan in its admissions process.  The Plan was mandated by the Texas Legislature in the wake of <i>Hopwood</i>, so the University, like petitioner in this litigation, has likely taken the Plan as a given since its implementation in 1998.  If the University had no reason to think that it could deviate from the Top Ten Percent Plan, it similarly had no reason to keep extensive data on the Plan or the students admitted under it\xe2\x80\x94particularly in the years before <i>Fisher I</i> clarified the stringency of the strict-scrutiny burden for a school that employs race-conscious review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the circumstances of this case, then, a remand would do nothing more than prolong a suit that has already persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both sides significant resources.  Petitioner long since has graduated from another college, and the University\xe2\x80\x99s policy\xe2\x80\x94and the data on which it first was based\xe2\x80\x94may have evolved or changed in material ways.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The fact that this case has been litigated on a somewhat artificial basis, furthermore, may limit its value for prospective guidance.  The Texas Legislature, in enacting the Top Ten Percent Plan, cannot much be criticized, for it was responding to <i>Hopwood</i>, which at the time was binding law in the State of Texas.  That legislative response, in turn, circumscribed the University\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in crafting its admissions policy.  These circumstances refute any criticism that the University did not make good-faith efforts to comply with the law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That does not diminish, however, the University\xe2\x80\x99s continuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing circumstances.  The University en-gages in periodic reassessment of the constitutionality, and efficacy, of its admissions program.  See Supp. App. 32a; App. 448a.  Going forward, that assessment must be undertaken in light of the experience the school has accumulated and the data it has gathered since the adoption of its admissions plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the University examines this data, it should remain mindful that diversity takes many forms.  Formalistic racial classifications may sometimes fail to capture diversity in all of its dimensions and, when used in a divisive manner, could undermine the educational benefits the University values.  Through regular evaluation of data and consideration of student experience, the University must tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances, ensuring that race plays no greater role than is neces-sary to meet its compelling interest.  The University\xe2\x80\x99s examination of the data it has acquired in the years since petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application, for these reasons, must proceed with full respect for the constraints imposed by the Equal Protection Clause.  The type of data collected, and the manner in which it is considered, will have a significant bearing on how the University must shape its admissions policy to satisfy strict scrutiny in the years to come.  Here, however, the Court is necessarily limited to the narrow question before it: whether, drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment at the time her application was rejected.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In seeking to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, petitioner makes four arguments.  First, she argues that the University has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity.  According to petitioner, the University must set forth more precisely the level of minority enrollment that would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass.\xe2\x80\x9d  Without a clearer sense of what the University\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate goal is, petitioner argues, a reviewing court cannot assess whether the University\xe2\x80\x99s admissions program is narrowly tailored to that goal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have made clear, however, the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students.  Rather, a university may institute a race-conscious admissions program as a means of obtaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Grutter</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328.  As this Court has said, enrolling a diverse student body \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 330 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Equally important, \xe2\x80\x9cstudent body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to these educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner seems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to pure numbers.  Indeed, since the University is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient.  A university\xe2\x80\x99s goals cannot be elusory or amorphous\xe2\x80\x94they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record reveals that in first setting forth its current admissions policy, the University articulated concrete and precise goals.  On the first page of its 2004 \xe2\x80\x9cProposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Univer-sity identifies the educational values it seeks to realize through its admissions process: the destruction of stereotypes, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98promot[ion of] cross-racial understanding,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the preparation of a student body \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cultivat[ion of] a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 1a; see also <i>id.,</i> at 69a; App. 314a\xe2\x80\x93315a (deposition of N. Bruce Walker (Walker Dep.)), 478a\xe2\x80\x93479a (Walker Aff. \xc2\xb64) (setting forth the same goals).  Later in the proposal, the University explains that it strives to provide an \xe2\x80\x9cacademic environment\xe2\x80\x9d that offers a \xe2\x80\x9crobust exchange of ideas, exposure to differing cultures, preparation for the challenges of an increasingly diverse workforce, and acquisition of competencies required of future leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 23a.  All of these objectives, as a general matter, mirror the \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has approved in its prior cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The University has provided in addition a \xe2\x80\x9creasoned, principled explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for its decision to pursue these goals.  <i>Fisher I</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The Univer-sity\xe2\x80\x99s 39-page proposal was written following a year-long study, which concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial understanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and learning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 25a; see also App. 481a\xe2\x80\x93482a (Walker Aff. \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb68\xe2\x80\x9312) (describing the \xe2\x80\x9cthoughtful review\xe2\x80\x9d the University undertook when it faced the \xe2\x80\x9cimportant decision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whether or not to use race in its admissions process\xe2\x80\x9d).  Further support for the University\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion can be found in the depositions and affidavits from various admissions officers, all of whom articulate the same, consistent \xe2\x80\x9creasoned, principled explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.,</i> at 253a (Ishop Dep.), 314a\xe2\x80\x93318a, 359a (Walker Dep.), 415a\xe2\x80\x93416a (Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Statement of Facts), 478a\xe2\x80\x93479a, 481a\xe2\x80\x93482a (Walker Aff. \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb64, 10\xe2\x80\x9313).  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the University\xe2\x80\x99s goal was insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, petitioner argues that the University has no need to consider race because it had already \xe2\x80\x9cachieved critical mass\xe2\x80\x9d by 2003 using the Top Ten Percent Plan and race-neutral holistic review.  Brief for Petitioner 46.  Petitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a race-conscious plan.  The record reveals, however, that, at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application, the University could not be faulted on this score.  Before changing its policy the University conducted \xe2\x80\x9cmonths of study and deliberation, including retreats, interviews, [and] review of data,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 446a, and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful in achieving\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient racial diversity at the University, Supp. App. 25a.  At no stage in this litigation has petitioner challenged the University\xe2\x80\x99s good faith in conducting its studies, and the Court properly declines to consider the extrarecord materials the dissent relies upon, many of which are tangential to this case at best and none of which the University has had a full opportunity to respond to.  See,<i> e.g., post, </i>at 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (opinion of Alito, J.) (describing a 2015 report regarding the admission of applicants who are related to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98politically connected individuals\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record itself contains significant evidence, both statistical and anecdotal, in support of the University\xe2\x80\x99s position.  To start, the demographic data the University has submitted show consistent stagnation in terms of the percentage of minority students enrolling at the Univer-sity from 1996 to 2002.  In 1996, for example, 266 African-American freshmen enrolled, a total that constituted 4.1 percent of the incoming class.  In 2003, the year <i>Grutter</i> was decided, 267 African-American students enrolled\xe2\x80\x94again, 4.1 percent of the incoming class.  The numbers for Hispanic and Asian-American students tell a similar story.  See Supp. App. 43a.  Although demographics alone are by no means dispositive, they do have some value as a gauge of the University\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enroll students who can offer underrepresented perspectives.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to this broad demographic data, the University put forward evidence that minority students admitted under the <i>Hopwood </i>regime experienced feelings of loneliness and isolation.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, App. 317a\xe2\x80\x93318a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This anecdotal evidence is, in turn, bolstered by further, more nuanced quantitative data.  In 2002, 52 percent of undergraduate classes with at least five students had no African-American students enrolled in them, and 27 percent had only one African-American student.  Supp. App. 140a.  In other words, only 21 percent of undergraduate classes with five or more students in them had more than one African-American student enrolled.  Twelve percent of these classes had no Hispanic students, as compared to 10 percent in 1996.  <i>Id.,</i> at 74a, 140a.  Though a college must continually reassess its need for race-conscious review, here that assessment appears to have been done with care, and a reasonable determination was made that the University had not yet attained its goals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, petitioner argues that considering race was not necessary because such consideration has had only a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98minimal impact\xe2\x80\x99 in advancing the [University\xe2\x80\x99s] compelling interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 46; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23:10\xe2\x80\x9312; 24:13\xe2\x80\x9325:2, 25:24\xe2\x80\x9326:3.  Again, the record does not support this assertion.  In 2003, 11 percent of the Texas residents enrolled through holistic review were Hispanic and 3.5 percent were African-American.  Supp. App. 157a.  In 2007, by contrast, 16.9 percent of the Texas holistic-review freshmen were Hispanic and 6.8 percent were African-American.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Those increases\xe2\x80\x94of 54 percent and 94 percent, respectively\xe2\x80\x94show that consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on the diversity of the University\xe2\x80\x99s freshman class.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for the impact of racial consideration to be minor.  The fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s final argument is that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are numerous other available race-neutral means of achieving\xe2\x80\x9d the University\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest.  Brief for Petitioner 47.  A review of the record reveals, however, that, at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application, none of her proposed alternatives was a workable means for the University to attain the benefits of diversity it sought.  For example, petitioner suggests that the University could intensify its outreach efforts to African-American and Hispanic applicants.  But the University submitted extensive evidence of the many ways in which it already had intensified its outreach efforts to those students.  The University has created three new scholarship programs, opened new regional admissions centers, increased its recruitment budget by half-a-million dollars, and organized over 1,000 recruitment events.  Supp. App. 29a\xe2\x80\x9332a; App. 450a\xe2\x80\x93452a (citing affidavit of Michael Orr \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb64\xe2\x80\x9320).  Perhaps more significantly, in the wake of <i>Hopwood</i>, the University spent seven years attempting to achieve its compelling interest using race-neutral holistic review.  None of these efforts succeeded, and petitioner fails to offer any meaningful way in which the University could have improved upon them at the time of her application.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to academic and socioeconomic factors in the University\xe2\x80\x99s admissions calculus.  This proposal ignores the fact that the University tried, and failed, to increase diversity through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors.  And it further ignores this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent making clear that the Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence.  <i>Grutter</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s final suggestion is to uncap the Top Ten Percent Plan, and admit more\xe2\x80\x94if not all\xe2\x80\x94the University\xe2\x80\x99s students through a percentage plan.  As an initial matter, petitioner overlooks the fact that the Top Ten Percent Plan, though facially neutral, cannot be understood apart from its basic purpose, which is to boost minority enrollment.  Percentage plans are \xe2\x80\x9cadopted with racially segregated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that drives such plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Consequently, petitioner cannot assert simply that increasing the University\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a percentage plan would make its admissions policy more race neutral.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if, as a matter of raw numbers, minority enrollment would increase under such a regime, petitioner would be hard-pressed to find convincing support for the proposition that college admissions would be improved if they were a function of class rank alone.  That approach would sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of enrolling a higher number of minority students.  A system that selected every student through class rank alone would exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training.  It would exclude a talented young biologist who struggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes.  And it would exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school, only to find herself just outside of the top decile of her class.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These are but examples of the general problem.  Class rank is a single metric, and like any single metric, it will capture certain types of people and miss others.  This does not imply that students admitted through holistic review are necessarily more capable or more desirable than those admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.  It merely reflects the fact that privileging one characteristic above all others does not lead to a diverse student body.  Indeed, to compel universities to admit students based on class rank alone is in deep tension with the goal of educational diversity as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have defined it.  See <i>Grutter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 340 (explaining that percentage plans \xe2\x80\x9cmay preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university\xe2\x80\x9d); 758 F. 3d, at 653 (pointing out that the Top Ten Percent Law leaves out students \xe2\x80\x9cwho fell outside their high school\xe2\x80\x99s top ten percent but excelled in unique ways that would enrich the diversity of [the University\xe2\x80\x99s] educational experience\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleaves a gap in an admissions process seeking to create the multi-dimensional diversity that [<i>Regents of Univ. of Cal</i>. v. <i>Bakke,</i>\n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 265 (1978)\n,] envisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  At its center, the Top Ten Percent Plan is a blunt instrument that may well compromise the University\xe2\x80\x99s own definition of the diversity it seeks.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to these fundamental problems, an admissions policy that relies exclusively on class rank creates perverse incentives for applicants.  Percentage plans \xe2\x80\x9cencourage parents to keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage students from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point averages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gratz</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 304, n. 10 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all these reasons, although it may be true that the Top Ten Percent Plan in some instances may provide a path out of poverty for those who excel at schools lacking in resources, the Plan cannot serve as the admissions solution that petitioner suggests.  Wherever the balance between percentage plans and holistic review should rest, an effective admissions policy cannot prescribe, realisti-cally, the exclusive use of a percentage plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, none of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suggested alternatives\xe2\x80\x94nor other proposals considered or discussed in the course of this litigation\xe2\x80\x94have been shown to be \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d means through which the University could have met its educational goals, as it understood and defined them in 2008.  <i>Fisher I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).

See <i>Fisher</i> v. <i>University of Tex. at Austin</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013) (<i>Fisher I</i>).  In that decision, we held that strict scrutiny requires the University of Texas at Austin (UT or University) to show that its use of race and ethnicity in making admissions decisions serves compelling interests and that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve those ends.  Rejecting the argument that we should defer to UT\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on those matters, we made it clear that UT was obligated (1) to identify the interests justifying its plan with enough specificity to permit a reviewing court to determine whether the requirements of strict scrutiny were met, and (2) to show that those requirements were in fact satisfied.  On remand, UT failed to do what our prior decision demanded.  The University has still not identified with any degree of specificity the interests that its use of race and ethnicity is supposed to serve.  Its primary argument is that merely invoking \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits of diversity\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficient and that it need not identify any metric that would allow a court to determine whether its plan is needed to serve, or is actually serving, those interests.  This is nothing less than theplea for deference that we emphatically rejected in our prior decision.  Today, however, the Court inexplicably grants that request.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent that UT has ever moved beyond a plea for deference and identified the relevant interests in more specific terms, its efforts have been shifting, unpersuasive, and, at times, less than candid.  When it adopted its race-based plan, UT said that the plan was needed to promote classroom diversity.  See Supp. App. 1a, 24a\xe2\x80\x9325a, 39a; App. 316a.  It pointed to a study showing that African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American students were underrepresented in many classes.  See Supp. App. 26a.  But UT has never shown that its race-conscious plan actually ameliorates this situation.  The University presents no evidence that its admissions officers, in administering the \xe2\x80\x9cholistic\xe2\x80\x9d component of its plan, make any effort to determine whether an African-American, Hispanic, or Asian-American student is likely to enroll in classes in which minority students are underrepresented.  And although UT\xe2\x80\x99s records should permit it to determine without much difficulty whether holistic admittees are any more likely than students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Law, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa751.803 (West Cum. Supp. 2015), to enroll in the classes lacking racial or ethnic diversity, UT either has not crunched those numbers or has not revealed what they show.  Nor has UT explained why the underrepresentation of Asian-American students in many classes justifies its plan, which discriminates <i>against</i> those students.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At times, UT has claimed that its plan is needed to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass\xe2\x80\x9d of African-American and His-panic students, but it has never explained what this term means.  According to UT, a critical mass is neither some absolute number of African-American or Hispanic students nor the percentage of African-Americans or Hispanics in the general population of the State.  The term remains undefined, but UT tells us that it will let the courts know when the desired end has been achieved.  See App. 314a\xe2\x80\x93315a.  This is a plea for deference\xe2\x80\x94indeed, for blind deference\xe2\x80\x94the very thing that the Court rejected in<i>Fisher I.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">UT has also claimed at times that the race-based component of its plan is needed because the Top Ten Percent Plan admits <i>the wrong kind</i> of African-American and Hispanic students, namely, students from poor families who attend schools in which the student body is predominantly African-American or Hispanic.  As UT put it in its brief in <i>Fisher I</i>, the race-based component of its admissions plan is needed to admit \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents, O. T. 2012, No. 11\xe2\x80\x93345, p.\xc2\xa034.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After making this argument in its first trip to this Court, UT apparently had second thoughts, and in the latest round of briefing UT has attempted to disavow ever having made the argument.  See Brief for Respondents 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that UT\xe2\x80\x99s interest is favoring \xe2\x80\x98affluent\xe2\x80\x99 minorities is a fabrication\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>id.</i>, at 15.  But it did, and the argument turns affirmative action on its head.  Affirmative-action programs were created to help <i>disadvantaged</i> students.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although UT now disowns the argument that the Top Ten Percent Plan results in the admission of the wrong kind of African-American and Hispanic students, the Fifth Circuit majority bought a version of that claim.  As the panel majority put it, the Top Ten African-American and Hispanic admittees cannot match the holistic African-American and Hispanic admittees when it comes to \xe2\x80\x9crecords of personal achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cvariety of perspectives\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clife experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunique skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  758 F.\xc2\xa03d 633, 653 (2014).  All in all, according to the panel majority, the Top Ten Percent students cannot \xe2\x80\x9cenrich the diversity of the student body\xe2\x80\x9d in the same way as the holistic admittees.  <i>Id.,</i> at 654.  As Judge Garza put it in dissent, the panel majority concluded that the Top Ten Percent admittees are \xe2\x80\x9csomehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 669\xe2\x80\x93670 (Garza, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit reached this conclusion with little direct evidence regarding the characteristics of the Top Ten Percent and holistic admittees.  Instead, the assumption behind the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is that most of the African-American and Hispanic students admitted under the race-neutral component of UT\xe2\x80\x99s plan were able to rank in the top decile of their high school classes only because they did not have to compete against white and Asian-American students.  This insulting stereotype is not supported by the record.  African-American and Hispanic students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan receive higher college grades than the African-American and Hispanic students admitted under the race-conscious program.  See Supp. App. 164a\xe2\x80\x93165a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It should not have been necessary for us to grant review a second time in this case, and I have no greater desire than the majority to see the case drag on.  But that need not happen.  When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious plan, it had every reason to know that its plan would have to satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would be <i>its burden</i> to show that the plan was narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests.  UT has failed to make that showing.  By all rights, judgment should be entered in favor of petitioner.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But if the majority is determined to give UT yet another chance, we should reverse and send this case back to the District Court.  What the majority has now done\xe2\x80\x94awarding a victory to UT in an opinion that fails to address the important issues in the case\xe2\x80\x94is simply wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Over the past 20 years, UT has frequently modified its admissions policies, and it has generally employed race and ethnicity in the most aggressive manner permitted under controlling precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before 1997, race was considered directly as part of the general admissions process, and it was frequently a controlling factor.  Admissions were based on two criteria: (1)\xc2\xa0the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s Academic Index (AI), which was computed from standardized test scores and high school class rank, and (2) the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  In 1996, the last year this race-conscious system was in place, 4.1% of enrolled freshmen were African-American, 14.7% were Asian-American, and 14.5% were Hispanic.  Supp. App. 43a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Hopwood</i> v. <i>Texas</i>, 78 F.\xc2\xa03d 932 (1996), prohibited UT from using race in admissions.  In response to <i>Hopwood</i>, beginning with the 1997 admissions cycle, UT instituted a \xe2\x80\x9cholistic review\xe2\x80\x9d process in which it considered an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s AI as well as a Personal Achievement Index (PAI) that was intended, among other things, to increase minority enrollment.  The race-neutral PAI was a composite of scores from two essays and a personal achievement score, which in turn was based on a holistic review of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s leadership qualities, extracurricular activities, honors and awards, work experience, community service, and special circumstances.  Special consideration was given to applicants from poor families, applicants from homes in which a language other than English was customarily spoken, and applicants from single-parent households.  Because this race-neutral plan gave a preference to disadvantaged students, it had the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionately\xe2\x80\x9d benefiting minority candidates.  645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 587, 592 (WD Tex. 2009).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas Legislature also responded to <i>Hopwood.  </i>In 1997, it enacted the Top Ten Percent Plan, which man-dated that UT admit all Texas seniors who rank in the top 10% of their high school classes.  This facially race-neutral law served to equalize competition between students who live in relatively affluent areas with superior schools and students in poorer areas served by schools offering fewer opportunities for academic excellence.  And by benefiting the students in the latter group, this plan, like the race-neutral holistic plan already adopted by UT, tended to benefit African-American and Hispanic students, who are often trapped in inferior public schools.  758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 650\xe2\x80\x93653.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Starting in 1998, when the Top Ten Percent Plan took effect, UT\xe2\x80\x99s holistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system continued to be used to fill the seats in the entering class that were not taken by Top Ten Percent students.  The AI/PAI system was also used to determine program placement forall incoming students, including the Top Ten Percent students.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThe University\xe2\x80\x99s revised admissions process, coupled with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in a more racially diverse environment at the University.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  In 2000, UT announced that its \xe2\x80\x9cenrollment levels for African American and Hispanic freshmen have returned to those of 1996, the year before the <i>Hopwood </i>decision prohibited the consideration of race in admissions policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 393a; see also Supp. App. 23a\xe2\x80\x9324a (pre-<i>Hopwood </i>diversity levels were \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d in 1999); App. 392a\xe2\x80\x93393a (\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Top 10 Percent Law\xe2\x80\x99 is Working for Texas\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas enabled us to diversify enrollment at UT Austin with talented students who succeed\xe2\x80\x9d).  And in 2003, UT proclaimed that it had \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 396a; see also <i>id.</i>, at 398a (\xe2\x80\x9cDiversity efforts at The University of Texas at Austin have brought a higher number of freshman minority students\xe2\x80\x94African Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans\xe2\x80\x94to the campus than were enrolled in 1996, the year a court ruling ended the use of affirmative action in the university\xe2\x80\x99s enrollment process\xe2\x80\x9d).  By 2004\xe2\x80\x94the last year under the holistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system\xe2\x80\x94UT\xe2\x80\x99s entering class was 4.5% African-American, 17.9% Asian-American, and 16.9% Hispanic.  Supp. App. 156a.  The 2004 entering class thus had a higher percentage of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanics than the class that entered in 1996, when UT had last employed racial preferences.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notwithstanding these lauded results, UT leapt at the opportunity to reinsert race into the process.  On June 23, 2003, this Court decided <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306 (2003)\n, which upheld the University of Michigan Law School\xe2\x80\x99s race-conscious admissions system.  In <i>Grutter</i>, the Court warned that a university contemplating the consideration of race as part of its admissions process must engage in \xe2\x80\x9cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 339.  Nevertheless, <i>on the very day Grutter was handed down</i>, UT\xe2\x80\x99s president announced that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he University of Texas at Austin <i>will </i>modify its admissions procedures\xe2\x80\x9d in light of <i>Grutter</i>, including by \xe2\x80\x9cimplementing procedures at the undergraduate level that combine the benefits of the Top 10 Percent Law with affirmative action programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 406a\xe2\x80\x93407a (emphasis added).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  UT purports to have later engaged in \xe2\x80\x9calmost a year of deliberations,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 482a, but there is no evidence that the reintroduction of race into the admissions process was anything other than a foregone conclusion following the president\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThe University\xe2\x80\x99s plan to resume race-conscious admissions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an internal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions\xe2\x80\x9d (Proposal).  <i>Fisher I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4).  The Proposal stated that UT needed race-conscious admissions because it had not yet achieved a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass of racial diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 25a.  In support of this claim, UT cited two pieces of evidence.  First, it noted that there were \xe2\x80\x9csignificant differences between the racial and ethnic makeup of the University\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate population and the state\xe2\x80\x99s population.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 24a.  Second, the Proposal \xe2\x80\x9crelied in substantial part,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Fisher I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4), on a study of a subset of undergraduate classes containing at least five students, see Supp. App. 26a.  The study showed that among select classes with five or more students, 52% had no African-Americans, 16% had no Asian-Americans, and 12% had no Hispanics.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Moreover, the study showed, only 21% of these classes had two or more African-Americans, 67% had two or more Asian-Americans, and 70% had two or more Hispanics.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Based on this study, the Proposal concluded that UT \xe2\x80\x9chas not reached a critical mass at the classroom level.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 24a.  The Proposal did not analyze the backgrounds, life experiences, leadership qualities, awards, extracurricular activities, community service, personal attributes, or other characteristics of the minority students who were already being admitted to UT under the holistic, race-neutral process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cTo implement the Proposal the University included a student\xe2\x80\x99s race as a component of the PAI score, beginning with applicants in the fall of 2004.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe University asks students to classify themselves from among five predefined racial categories on the application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>\xe2\x80\x9cRace is not assigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed that race is a meaningful factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>UT decided to use racial preferences to benefit African-American and Hispanic students because it considers those groups \xe2\x80\x9cunderrepresented minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 25a; see also App. 445a\xe2\x80\x93446a (defining \xe2\x80\x9cunderrepresented minorities\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cHispanic[s] and African Americans\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even though UT\xe2\x80\x99s classroom study showed that more classes lacked Asian-American students than lacked Hispanic students, Supp. App. 26a, UT deemed Asian-Americans \xe2\x80\x9c<i>overrepresented</i>\xe2\x80\x9d based on state demographics, 645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 606; see also <i>ibid. </i>(\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undisputed that UT considers African-Americans and Hispanics to be underrepresented but does not con-sider Asian-Americans to be underrepresented\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although UT claims that race is but a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor of a factor of a factor of a factor,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 608, UT acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9crace is the only one of [its] holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 54 (Oct. 10, 2012).  \xe2\x80\x9cBecause an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race is identified at the front of the admissions file, reviewers are aware of it throughout the evaluation.\xe2\x80\x9d  645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 597; see also <i>id.,</i> at 598 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] candidate\xe2\x80\x99s race is known throughout the application process\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consideration of race therefore pervades every aspect of UT\xe2\x80\x99s admissions process.  See App. 219a (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are certainly aware of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  It\xe2\x80\x99s on the front page of the application that\xe2\x80\x99s being read [and] is used in context with everything else that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s file\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is by design, as UT considers its use of racial classifications to be a benign form of \xe2\x80\x9csocial engineering.\xe2\x80\x9d  Powers, Why Schools Still Need Affirmative Action, National L. J., Aug. 4, 2014, p. 22 (editorial by Bill Powers, President of UT from 2006\xe2\x80\x932015) (\xe2\x80\x9cOpponents accuse defenders of race-conscious admissions of being in favor of \xe2\x80\x98social engineering,\xe2\x80\x99 to which I believe we should reply, \xe2\x80\x98Guilty as charged\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notwithstanding the omnipresence of racial classifications, UT claims that it keeps no record of how those classifications affect its process.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe university doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep any statistics on how many students are affected by the consideration of race in admissions decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d and it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not know how many minority students are affected in a positive manner by the consideration of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 337a.  According to UT, it has no way of making these determinations.  See <i>id.,</i> at 320a\xe2\x80\x93322a.  UT says that it does not tell its admissions officers how much weight to give to race.  See Deposition of Gary Lavergne 43\xe2\x80\x9345, Record in No. 1:08\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300263 (WD Tex.), Doc. 94\xe2\x80\x939 (Lavergne Deposition).  And because the influence of race is always \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual,\xe2\x80\x9d UT claims, it cannot provide even a single example of an instance in which race impacted a student\xe2\x80\x99s odds of admission.  See App. 220a (\xe2\x80\x9cQ. Could you give me an example where race would have some impact on an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s personal achievement score?  A.  To be honest, not really .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Although UT claims an interest in the educational benefits of diversity, it appears to have paid little attention to anything other than the number of minority students on its campus and in its classrooms.  UT\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 Proposal illustrates this approach by repeatedly citing numerical assessments of the racial makeup of the student body and various classes as the justification for adopting a race-conscious plan.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Supp. App. 24a\xe2\x80\x9326a, 30a.  Instead of focusing on the benefits of diversity, UT seems to have resorted to a simple racial census.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority, for its part, claims that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough demographics alone are by no means dispositive, they do have some value as a gauge of the University\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enroll students who can offer underrepresented perspectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  But even if UT merely \xe2\x80\x9cview[s] the demographic disparity as cause for concern,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29, and is seeking only to reduce\xe2\x80\x94rather than eliminate\xe2\x80\x94the disparity, that undefined goal cannot be properly subjected to strict scrutiny.  In that case, there is simply no way for a court to know what specific demographic interest UT is pursuing, why a race-neutral alternative could not achieve that interest, and when that demographic goal would be satisfied.  If a demographic discrepancy can serve as \xe2\x80\x9ca gauge\xe2\x80\x9d that justifies the use of racial discrimination, <i>ante</i>, at 14, then racial discrimination can be justified on that basis until demographic parity is reached.  There is no logical stopping point short of patently unconstitutional racial balancing.  Demographic disparities thus cannot be used to satisfy strict scrutiny here.

The Proposal stressed that UT \xe2\x80\x9chas not reached a critical mass at the <i>classroom level</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 24a (emphasis added); see also <i>id.</i>, at 1a, 25a, 39a; App. 316a.  In support of this proposition, UT relied on a study of select classes containing five or more students.  As noted above, the study indicated that 52% of these classes had no African-Americans, 16% had no Asian-Americans, and 12% had no Hispanics.  Supp. App. 26a.  The study further suggested that only 21% of these classes had two or more African-Americans, 67% had two or more Asian-Americans, and 70% had two or more Hispanics.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Based on this study, UT concluded that it had a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling educational interest\xe2\x80\x9d in employing racial preferences to ensure that it did not \xe2\x80\x9chave large numbers of classes in which there are no students\xe2\x80\x94or only a single student\xe2\x80\x94of a given underrepresented race or ethnicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 25a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">UT now equivocates, disclaiming any discrete interest in classroom diversity.  See Brief for Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Instead, UT has taken the position that the lack of classroom diversity was merely a \xe2\x80\x9cred flag that UT had not yet fully realized\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutionally permissible educational benefits of diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93345, at 43.  But UT has failed to identify the level of classroom diversity it deems sufficient, again making it im-possible to apply strict scrutiny.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  A reviewing court cannot determine whether UT\xe2\x80\x99s race-conscious programwas necessary to remove the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cred flag\xe2\x80\x9d without understanding the precise nature of that goal or know-ing when the \xe2\x80\x9cred flag\xe2\x80\x9d will be considered to havedisappeared.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Putting aside UT\xe2\x80\x99s effective abandonment of its interest in classroom diversity, the evidence cited in support of that interest is woefully insufficient to show that UT\xe2\x80\x99s race-conscious plan was necessary to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  As far as the record shows, UT failed to even scratch the surface of the available data before reflexively resorting to racial preferences.  For instance, because UT knows which students were admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan and which were not, as well as which students enrolled in which classes, it would seem relatively easy to determine whether Top Ten Percent students were more or less likely than holistic admittees to enroll in the types of classes where diversity was lacking.  But UT never bothered to figure this out.  See <i>ante</i>, at 9 (acknowledging that UT submitted no evidence regarding \xe2\x80\x9chow students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor is there any indication that UT instructed admissions officers to search for African-American and Hispanic applicants who would fill particular gaps at the classroom level.  Given UT\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present such evidence, it has not demonstrated that its race-conscious policy would promote classroom diversity any better than race-neutral options, such as expanding the Top Ten Percent Plan or using race-neutral holistic admissions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, if UT is truly seeking to expose its students to a diversity of ideas and perspectives, its policy is poorly tailored to serve that end.

And unless the University is engaged in unconstitutional racial balancing based on Texas demographics (where Hispanics outnumber Asian-Americans), see Part II\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x931, <i>supra</i>, it seemingly views the classroom contributions of Asian-American students as less valuable than those of Hispanic students.  In UT\xe2\x80\x99s view, apparently, \xe2\x80\x9cAsian Americans are not worth as much as Hispanics in promoting \xe2\x80\x98cross-racial understanding,\xe2\x80\x99 breaking down \xe2\x80\x98racial stereotypes,\xe2\x80\x99 and enabling students to \xe2\x80\x98better understand persons of different races.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Asian American Legal Foundation et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11 (representing 117 Asian-American organizations).

So why has UT lumped them together and concluded that it is appropriate to discriminate against Asian-American students because they are \xe2\x80\x9coverrepresented\xe2\x80\x9d in the UT student body?  UT has no good answer.  And UT makes no effort to ensure that it has a critical mass of, say, \xe2\x80\x9cFilipino Americans\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCambodian Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (Oct. 10, 2012).

UT does not specify what it means to be \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican-American,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHis-panic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAsian American,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNative American,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWhite.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 30a.  And UT evidently labels each student as falling into only a single racial or ethnic group, see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.,</i> at 10a\xe2\x80\x9313a, 30a, 43a\xe2\x80\x9344a, 71a, 156a\xe2\x80\x93157a, 169a\xe2\x80\x93170a, without explaining how individuals with ancestors from different groups are to be characterized.  As racial and ethnic prejudice recedes, more and more students will have parents (or grandparents) who fall into more than one of UT\xe2\x80\x99s five groups.  According to census figures, individuals describing themselves as members of multiple races grew by 32% from 2000 to 2010.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  A recent survey reported that 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asian-Americans marry a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  UT\xe2\x80\x99s crude classification system is ill suited for the more integrated country that we are rapidly becoming.  UT assumes that if an applicant describes himself or herself as a member of a particular race or ethnicity, that applicant will have a perspective that differs from that of applicants who describe themselves as members of different groups.  But is this necessarily so?  If an applicant hasone grandparent, great-grandparent, or great-great-grandparent who was a member of a favored group, is that enough to permit UT to infer that this student\xe2\x80\x99s classroom contribution will reflect a distinctive perspective or set of experiences associated with that group?  UT does not say.  It instead relies on applicants to \xe2\x80\x9cclassify themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  This is an invitation for applicants to game the system.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, it seems clear that the lack of classroom diver-sity is attributable in good part to factors other than the representation of the favored groups in the UT student population.  UT offers an enormous number of classes in a wide range of subjects, and it gives undergraduates a very large measure of freedom to choose their classes.  UT also offers courses in subjects that are likely to have special appeal to members of the minority groups given preferential treatment under its challenged plan, and this of course diminishes the number of other courses in which these students can enroll.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Supp. App. 72a\xe2\x80\x9373a (indicating that the representation of African-Americans and Hispanics in UT classrooms varies substantially from major to major).  Having designed an undergraduate program that virtually ensures a lack of classroom diver-sity, UT is poorly positioned to argue that this very result provides a justification for racial and ethnic discrimination, which the Constitution rarely allows.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">UT\xe2\x80\x99s purported interest in intraracial diversity, or \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity within diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 34, also falls short.  At bottom, this argument relies on the unsupported assumption that there is something deficient or at least radically different about the African-American and Hispanic students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Throughout this litigation, UT has repeatedly shifted its position on the need for intraracial diversity.  Initially, in the 2004 Proposal, UT did not rely on this alleged need at all.  Rather, the Proposal \xe2\x80\x9cexamined two metrics\xe2\x80\x94classroom diversity and demographic disparities\xe2\x80\x94that it concluded were relevant to its ability to provide [the] benefits of diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  Those metrics looked only to the numbers of African-Americans and Hispanics, not to diversity within each group.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in <i>Fisher I</i>, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument.  UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority-minority schools.  These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the Univer-sity would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity <i>within </i>groups of underrepresented minorities.  In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid. </i>(claiming that privileged minorities \xe2\x80\x9chave great potential for serving as a \xe2\x80\x98bridge\xe2\x80\x99 in promoting cross-racial understanding, as well as in breaking down racial stereotypes\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid. </i>(intimating that the underprivileged minority students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan \xe2\x80\x9c<i>reinforc[e]</i>\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstereotypical assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43\xe2\x80\x9345 (Oct. 10, 2012) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough the percentage plan certainly helps with minority admissions, by and large, the\xe2\x80\x94the minorities who are admitted tend to come from seg-regated, racially-identifiable schools,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwe wantminorities from different backgrounds\xe2\x80\x9d).

In effect, UT asks the Court \xe2\x80\x9cto <i>assume</i>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without any evidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat minorities admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review.\xe2\x80\x9d  758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669\xe2\x80\x93670 (Garza, J., dissenting).  And UT\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions appear to be based on the pernicious stereotype that the African-Americans and Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan only got in because they did not have to compete against very many whites and Asian-Americans.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (Dec. 9, 2015).

When affirmative action programs were first adopted, it was for the purpose of helping the disadvantaged.  See, <i>e.g., Bakke</i>, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 272\xe2\x80\x93275 (opinion of Powell, J.) (explaining that the school\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative action program was designed \xe2\x80\x9cto increase the representation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98economically and/or educationally disadvantaged\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 applicants\xe2\x80\x9d).  Now we are told that a program that tends to admit poor and disadvantaged minority students is inadequate because it does not work to the advantage of those who are more fortunate.  This is affirmative action gone wild.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is also far from clear that UT\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions about the socioeconomic status of minorities admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan are even remotely accurate.  Take, for example, parental education.  In 2008, when petitioner applied to UT, approximately 79% of Texans aged 25 years or older had a high school diploma, 17% had a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, and 8% had a graduate or professional degree.  Dept. of Educ., Nat. Center for Educ. Statistics, T. Snyder &amp; S. Dillow,Digest of Education Statistics 2010, p.\xc2\xa029 (2011).  In contrast, 96% of African-Americans admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan had a parent with a high school diploma, 59% had a parent with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, and 26% had a parent with a graduate or professional degree.  See UT, Office of Admissions, Student Profile, Admitted Freshman Class of 2008, p.\xc2\xa08 (rev. Aug. 1,2012) (2008 Student Profile), online at https://uteas.app.box.\xc2\xa0com\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0s\xc2\xa0/twqozsbm2vb9lhm14o0v0czvqs1ygzqr/1/7732448553/23476747441/1.  Similarly, 83% of Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan had a parent with a high school diploma, 42% had a parent with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, and 21% had a parent with a graduate or professional degree.  <i>Ibid. </i> As these statistics make plain, the minorities that UT characterizes as \xe2\x80\x9ccoming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 53 (Dec. 9, 2015), generally come from households with education levels exceeding the norm in Texas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Or consider income levels.  In 2008, the median annual household income in Texas was $49,453.  United States Census Bureau, A. Noss, Household Income for States: 2008 and 2009, p.\xc2\xa04 (2010), online at https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/acsbr09-2.pdf.  The household income levels for Top Ten Percent African-American and Hispanic admittees were on par: Roughly half of such admittees came from households below the Texas median, and half came from households above the median.  See 2008 Student Profile 6.  And a large portion of these admittees are from households with income levels far exceeding the Texas median.  Specifically, 25% of African-Americans and 27% of Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan in 2008 were raised in households with incomes exceeding $80,000.  <i>Ibid.  </i>In light of this evidence, UT\xe2\x80\x99s actual argument is not that it needs affirmative action to ensure that its minority admittees are representative of the State of Texas.  Rather, UT is asserting that it needs affirmative action to ensure that its minority students disproportionally come from families that are wealthier and better educated than the average Texas family.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to using socioeconomic status to falsely denigrate the minority students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan, UT also argues that such students are academically inferior.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93345, at 33 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he top 10% law systematically hinders UT\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to assemble a class that is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. academically excellent\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cOn average,\xe2\x80\x9d UT claims, \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican-American and Hispanic holistic admits have higher SAT scores than their Top 10% counterparts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 43, n.\xc2\xa08.  As a result, UT argues that it needs race-conscious admissions to enroll academically superior minority students with higher SAT scores.  Regrettably, the majority seems to embrace this argument as well.  See <i>ante,</i> at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument fails for a number of reasons.  First, it is simply not true that Top Ten Percent minority admittees are academically inferior to holistic admittees.  In fact, as UT\xe2\x80\x99s president explained in 2000, \xe2\x80\x9ctop 10 percent high school students make much higher grades in college than non-top 10 percent students,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[s]trong academic performance in high school is an even better predictor of success in college than standardized test scores.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 393a\xe2\x80\x93394a; see also Lavergne Deposition 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s generally true that students admitted pursuant to HB 588 [the Top Ten Percent Law] have a higher level of academic performance at the University than students admitted outside of HB 588\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the statistics in the record reveal that, for each year between 2003 and 2007, African-American in-state freshmen who were admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law earned a higher mean grade point average than those admitted outside of the Top Ten Percent Law.  Supp. App. 164a.  The same is true for Hispanic students.  <i>Id.,</i> at 165a.  These conclusions correspond to the results of nationwide studies showing that high school grades are a better predictor of success in college than SAT scores.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is also more than a little ironic that UT uses the SAT, which has often been accused of reflecting racial and cultural bias,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>] as a reason for dissatisfaction with poor and disadvantaged African-American and Hispanic students who excel both in high school and in college.  Even if the SAT does not reflect such bias (and I am ill equipped to express a view on that subject), SAT scores clearly correlate with wealth.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">UT certainly has a compelling interest in admitting students who will achieve academic success, but it does not follow that it has a compelling interest in maximizing admittees\xe2\x80\x99 SAT scores.  Approximately 850 4-year-degree institutions do not require the SAT or ACT as part of the admissions process.  See J. Soares, SAT Wars: The Case for Test-Optional College Admissions 2 (2012).  This includes many excellent schools.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent that intraracial diversity refers to something other than admitting privileged minorities and minorities with higher SAT scores, UT has failed to define that interest with any clarity.  UT \xe2\x80\x9chas not provided any concrete targets for admitting more minority students possessing [the] unique qualitative-diversity characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d it desires.  758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669 (Garza, J., dissenting).  Nor has UT specified which characteristics, viewpoints, and life experiences are supposedly lacking in the African-Americans and Hispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.  In fact, because UT administrators make no collective,<i> </i>qualitative assessment of the minorities admitted automatically, they have no way of knowing which attributes are missing.  See <i>ante,</i> at 9 (admitting that there is no way of knowing \xe2\x80\x9chow students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review\xe2\x80\x9d); 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669 (Garza, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe University does not assess whether Top Ten Percent Law admittees exhibit sufficient diversity within diversity, whether the requisite \xe2\x80\x98change agents\xe2\x80\x99 are among them, and whether these admittees are able, collectively or individually, to combat pernicious stereotypes\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, UT has not identified \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, if ever, its goal (which remains undefined) for qualitative diversity will be reached.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 671.<i> </i>UT\xe2\x80\x99s intraracial diversity rationale is thus too imprecise to permit strict scrutiny analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Finally, UT\xe2\x80\x99s shifting positions on intraracial diversity, and the fact that intraracial diversity was not emphasized in the Proposal, suggest that it was not \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mississippi Univ. for Women</i> v. <i>Hogan</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 718,\n730 (1982)\n.  Instead, it appears to be a <i>post hoc</i> rationalization.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-H1">4</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">UT also alleges\xe2\x80\x94and the majority embraces\xe2\x80\x94an interest in avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cfeelings of loneliness and isolation\xe2\x80\x9d among minority students.  <i>Ante</i>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315; see Brief for Respondents 7\xe2\x80\x938, 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  In support of this argument, they cite only demographic data and anecdotal statements by UT officials that some students (we are not told how many) feel \xe2\x80\x9cisolated.\xe2\x80\x9d  This vague interest cannot possibly satisfy strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If UT is seeking demographic parity to avoid isolation, that is impermissible racial balancing.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x931, <i>supra</i>.  And linking racial loneliness and isolation to state demographics is illogical.  Imagine, for example, that an African-American student attends a university that is 20% African-American.  If racial isolation depends on a comparison to state demographics, then that student is more likely to feel isolated if the school is located in Mississippi (which is 37.0% African-American) than if it is located in Montana (which is 0.4% African-American).  See United States Census Bureau, QuickFacts, online at https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/28,30.  In reality, however, the student may feel\xe2\x80\x94if anything\xe2\x80\x94<i>less </i>isolated in Mississippi, where African-Americans are more prevalent in the population at large.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If, on the other hand, state demographics are not driving UT\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding racial isolation, then its treatment of Asian-American students is hard to understand.  As the District Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gross number of Hispanic students attending UT exceeds the gross number of Asian-American students.\xe2\x80\x9d  645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 606.  In 2008, for example, UT enrolled 1,338 Hispanic freshmen and 1,249 Asian-American freshmen.  Supp. App. 156a.  UT never explains why the Hispanic students\xe2\x80\x94but not the Asian-American students\xe2\x80\x94are isolated and lonely enough to receive an admissions boost, notwithstanding the fact that there are more Hispanics than Asian-Americans in the student population.  The anecdotal statements from UT officials certainly do not indicate that Hispanics are somehow lonelier than Asian-Americans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, UT has failed to articulate its interest in preventing racial isolation with any clarity, and it has provided no clear indication of how it will know when such isolation no longer exists.  Like UT\xe2\x80\x99s purported interests in demographic parity, classroom diversity, and intraracial diversity, its interest in avoiding racial isolation cannot justify the use of racial preferences.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even assuming UT is correct that, under <i>Grutter</i>, it need only cite a generic interest in the educational benefits of diversity, its plan still fails strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored.  Narrow tailoring requires \xe2\x80\x9ca careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  \xe2\x80\x9cIf a \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cnonracial approach .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could promote the substantial interest about as well and at tolerable administrative expense,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 then the university may not consider race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 11) (citations omitted).  Here, there is no evidence that race-blind, holistic review would not achieve UT\xe2\x80\x99s goals at least \xe2\x80\x9cabout as well\xe2\x80\x9d as UT\xe2\x80\x99s race-based policy.  In addition, UT could have adopted other approaches to further its goals, such as intensifying its outreach efforts, uncapping the Top Ten Percent Law, or placing greater weight on socioeconomic factors.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority argues that none of these alternatives is \xe2\x80\x9ca workable means for the University to attain the benefits of diversity it sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.  Tellingly, however, the majority devotes only a single, conclusory sentence to the most obvious race-neutral alternative: race-blind, holistic review that considers the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s unique characteristics and personal circumstances.  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  Under a system that combines the Top Ten Percent Plan with race-blind, holistic review, UT could still admit \xe2\x80\x9cthe star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ctalented young biologist who struggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cstudent whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 17.  All of these unique circumstances can be considered without injecting race into the process.  Because UT has failed to provide any evidence whatsoever that race-conscious holistic review will achieve its diversity objectives more effectively than race-blind holistic review, it cannot satisfy the heavy burden imposed by the strict scrutiny standard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> The fact that UT\xe2\x80\x99s racial preferences are unnecessary to achieve its stated goals is further demonstrated by their minimal effect on UT\xe2\x80\x99s diversity.  In 2004, when race was not a factor, 3.6% of non-Top Ten Percent Texas enrollees were African-American and 11.6% were Hispanic.  See Supp. App. 157a.<i> </i>It would stand to reason that at least the same percentages of African-American and Hispanic students would have been admitted through holistic review in 2008 even if race were not a factor.  If that assumption is correct, then race was determinative for only 15 African-American students and 18 Hispanic students in 2008 (representing 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of the total enrolled first-time freshmen from Texas high schools).  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority contends that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  This argument directly contradicts this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  Because racial classifications are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a highly suspect tool,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Grutter</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S, at 326, they should be employed only \xe2\x80\x9cas a last resort,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Croson</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 519 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also <i>Grutter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 342 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]acial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where, as here, racial preferences have only a slight impact on minority enrollment, a race-neutral alternative likely could have reached the same result.  See <i>Parents Involved</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 733\xe2\x80\x93734 (holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cminimal effect\xe2\x80\x9d of school districts\xe2\x80\x99 racial classifications \xe2\x80\x9ccasts doubt on the necessity of using [such] classifications\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csuggests that other means [of achieving their objectives] would be effective\xe2\x80\x9d).  As Justice Kennedy once aptly put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe small number of [students] affected suggests that the schoo[l] could have achieved [its] stated ends through different means.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 790 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And in this case, a race-neutral alternative could accomplish UT\xe2\x80\x99s objectives without gratuitously branding the covers of tens of thousands of applications with a bare racial stamp and \xe2\x80\x9ctell[ing] each student he or she is to be defined by race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 789.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority purports to agree with much of the above analysis.  The Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[r]ace may not be considered [by a university] unless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The Court admits that the burden of proof is on UT, <i>ante, </i>at 7, and that \xe2\x80\x9ca university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a race-conscious plan,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  And the Court recognizes that the record here is \xe2\x80\x9calmost devoid of information about the students who secured admission to the Univer-sity through the Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Court thus cannot know how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  This should be the end of the case: Without identifying what was missing from the African-American and Hispanic students it was already admitting through its race-neutral process, and without showing how the use of race-based admissions could rectify the deficiency, UT cannot demonstrate that its procedure is narrowly tailored.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet, somehow, the majority concludes that <i>petitioner</i> must lose as a result of UT\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide evidence justifying its decision to employ racial discrimination.  Tellingly, the Court frames its analysis as if petitioner bears the burden of proof here.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9319.  But it is not the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden to show that the consideration of race is unconstitutional.  To the extent the record is inadequate, the responsibility lies with UT.  For \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Parents Involved</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 786 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), particularly where, as here, the summary judgment posture obligates the Court to view the facts in the light most favorable to petitioner, see <i>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</i> v. <i>Zenith Radio Corp.</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574,\n587 (1986)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given that the University bears the burden of proof, it is not surprising that UT never made the argument that it should win based on the <i>lack </i>of evidence.  UT instead asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cif the Court believes there are any deficiencies in [the] record that cast doubt on the constitutionality of UT\xe2\x80\x99s policy, the answer is to order a trial, not to grant summary judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 51; see also <i>id.</i>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9353 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f this Court has any doubts about how the Top 10% Law works, or how UT\xe2\x80\x99s holistic plan offsets the tradeoffs of the Top 10% Law, the answer is to remand for a trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nevertheless, the majority cites three reasons for breaking from the normal strict scrutiny standard.  None of these is convincing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, the Court states that, while \xe2\x80\x9cth[e] evidentiary gap perhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court for further factfinding\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9can ordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d that will not work here because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application was rejected, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the University\xe2\x80\x99s combined percentage-plan/holistic-review approach to admission had been in effect for just three years,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cfurther factfinding\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmight yield little insight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  This reasoning is dangerously incorrect.  The Equal Protection Clause does not provide a 3-year grace period for racial discrimination.  Under strict scrutiny, UT was required to identify evidence that race-based admissions were necessary to achieve a compelling interest <i>before </i>it put them in place\xe2\x80\x94not three or more years after.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity <i>before </i>it turned to a race-conscious plan\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>Fisher I</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]trict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, <i>before</i> turning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  UT\xe2\x80\x99s failure to obtain actual evidence that racial preferences were necessary before resolving to use them only confirms that its decision to inject race into admissions was a reflexive response to <i>Grutter</i>,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>] and that UT did not seriously consider whether race-neutral means would serve its goals as well as a race-based process.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Second, in an effort to excuse UT\xe2\x80\x99s lack of evidence, the Court argues that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe University lacks any authority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit similarly had no reason to keep extensive data on the Plan or the students admitted under it\xe2\x80\x94particularly in the years before <i>Fisher I</i> clarified the stringency of the strict-scrutiny burden for a school that employs race-conscious review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But UT has long been aware that it bears the burden of justifying its racial discrimination under strict scrutiny.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Respondents in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93345, at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undisputed that UT\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in its holistic admissions process triggers strict scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat inquiry is undeniably rigorous\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>]  In light of this burden, UT had <i>every </i>reason to keep data on the students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.  Without such data, how could UT have possibly identified any characteristics that were lacking in Top Ten Percent admittees and that could be obtained via race-conscious admissions?  How could UT determine that employing a race-based process would serve its goals better than, for instance, expanding the Top Ten Percent Plan?  UT could not possibly make such determinations without studying the students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan.  Its failure to do so demonstrates that UT unthinkingly employed a race-based process without examining whether the use of race was actually necessary.  This is not\xe2\x80\x94as the Court claims\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cgood-faith effor[t] to comply with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to cite UT\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d as the basis for excusing its failure to adduce evidence is particularly inappropriate in light of UT\xe2\x80\x99s well-documented absence of good faith.  Since UT described its admissions policy to this Court in <i>Fisher I</i>, it has been revealed that this description was incomplete.  As explained in an independent investigation into UT admissions, UT maintained a clandestine admissions system that evaded public scrutiny until a former admissions officer blew the whistle in 2014.  See Kroll, Inc., Univer-sity of Texas at Austin\xe2\x80\x94Investigation of Admissions Prac-tices and Allegations of Undue Influence 4 (Feb. 6, 2015) (Kroll Report).  Under this longstanding, secret process, university officials regularly overrode normal holistic review to allow politically connected individuals\xe2\x80\x94such as donors, alumni, legislators, members of the Board of Regents, and UT officials and faculty\xe2\x80\x94to get family members and other friends admitted to UT, despite having grades and standardized test scores substantially below the median for admitted students.  <i>Id.</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314; see also Blanchard &amp; Hoppe, Influential Texans Helped Underqualified Students Get Into UT, Dallas Morning News, July 20, 2015, online at http://www.dallasnews.com/news/ education\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0headlines\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa020150720\xc2\xa0-\xc2\xa0influential\xc2\xa0-\xc2\xa0texans-helped-underqualified-students-get-into-ut.ece (\xe2\x80\x9cDozens of highly influential Texans\xe2\x80\x94including lawmakers, millionaire donors and university regents\xe2\x80\x94helped underqualified students get into the University of Texas, often by writing to UT officials, records show\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">UT officials involved in this covert process intentionally kept few records and destroyed those that did exist.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Kroll Report 43 (\xe2\x80\x9cEfforts were made to minimize paper trails and written lists during this end-of-cycle process.  At one meeting, the administrative assistants tried not keeping any notes, but this proved difficult, so they took notes and later shredded them.

And in the course of this litigation, UT has been less than forthright concerning its treatment of well-connected applicants.  Compare, <i>e.g., </i>Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (Dec. 9, 2015) (\xe2\x80\x9cUniversity of Texas does not do legacy, Your Honor\xe2\x80\x9d), and App. 281a (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur legacy policy is such that we don\xe2\x80\x99t consider legacy\xe2\x80\x9d), with Kroll Report 29 (discussing evidence that \xe2\x80\x9calumni/legacy influence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cresults each year in certain applicants receiving a competitive boost or special consideration in the admissions process,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that this is \xe2\x80\x9can aspect of the admissions process that does not appear in the public representations of UT-Austin\xe2\x80\x99s admissions process\xe2\x80\x9d).  Despite UT\xe2\x80\x99s apparent readiness to mislead the public and the Court, the majority is \xe2\x80\x9cwilling to be satisfied by [UT\xe2\x80\x99s] profession of its own good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grutter</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 394 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notwithstanding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s claims to the contrary, UT should have access to plenty of information about \xe2\x80\x9chow students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  UT undoubtedly knows which students were admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan and which were admitted through holistic review.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Supp. App. 157a.  And it undoubtedly has a record of all of the classes in which these students enrolled.  See, <i>e.g., </i>UT, Office of the Reg-istrar, Transcript\xe2\x80\x94Official, online at https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/transcripts-official (instructing graduates on how to obtain a transcript listing a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive record\xe2\x80\x9d of classes taken).  UT could use this information to demonstrate whether the Top Ten Percent minority admittees were more or less likely than the holistic minority admittees to choose to enroll in the courses lacking diversity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, UT assigns PAI scores to all students\xe2\x80\x94including those admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan\xe2\x80\x94for purposes of admission to individual majors.  Accordingly, all students must submit a full application containing essays, letters of recommendation, a resume, a list of courses taken in high school, and a description of any extracurricular activities, leadership experience, or special circumstances.  See App. 212a\xe2\x80\x93214a; 235a\xe2\x80\x93236a; 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669, n.\xc2\xa014 (Garza, J., dissenting).  Unless UT has destroyed these files,[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>] it could use them to compare the unique personal characteristics of Top Ten minority admittees with those of holistic minority admittees, and to determine whether the Top Ten admittees are, in fact, less desirable than the holistic admittees.  This may require UT to expend some resources, but that is an appropriate burden in light of the strict scrutiny standard and the fact that all of the relevant information is in UT\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  The cost of factfinding is a strange basis for awarding a victory to UT, which has a huge budget, and a loss to petitioner, who does not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, while I agree with the majority and the Fifth Circuit that <i>Fisher I </i>significantly changed the governing law by clarifying the stringency of the strict scrutiny standard,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>] that does not excuse UT from meeting that heavy burden.  In <i>Adarand</i>, for instance, another case in which the Court clarified the rigor of the strict scrutiny standard, the Court acknowledged that its decision \xe2\x80\x9calter[ed] the playing field in some important respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 237.  As a result, it \xe2\x80\x9cremand[ed] the case to the lower courts for further consideration <i>in light of the principles [it had] announced</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).<i> </i>In other words, the Court made clear that\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding the shift in the law\xe2\x80\x94the government had to meet the clarified burden it was announcing.  The Court did not embrace the notion that its decision to alter the stringency of the strict scrutiny standard somehow allowed the government to automatically prevail.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Third, the majority notes that this litigation has persisted for many years, that petitioner has already graduated from another college, that UT\xe2\x80\x99s policy may have changed over time, and that this case may offer little prospective guidance.  At most, these considerations counsel in favor of dismissing this case as improvidently granted.  But see, <i>e.g., Gratz</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251, and n.\xc2\xa01, 260\xe2\x80\x93262 (rejecting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, because the case had already persisted long enough for the petitioners to graduate from other schools, the case should be dismissed); <i>id.,</i> at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  None of these considerations has any bearing whatsoever on the merits of this suit.  The majority cannot side with UT simply because it is tired of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It is important to understand what is and what is not at stake in this case.  <i>What is not at stake</i> is whether UT or any other university may adopt an admissions plan that results in a student body with a broad representation of students from all racial and ethnic groups.  UT previously had a race-neutral plan that it claimed had \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 396a, and UT could have taken other steps that would have increased the diversity of its admitted students without taking race or ethnic background into account.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>What is at stake</i> is whether university administrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply by asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits of diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d without explaining\xe2\x80\x94much less proving\xe2\x80\x94why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its objectives.  Even though UT has never provided any coherent explanation for its asserted need to discriminate on the basis of race, and even though UT\xe2\x80\x99s position relies on a series of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions, the majority concludes that UT has met its heavy burden.  This conclusion is remarkable\xe2\x80\x94and remarkably wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because UT has failed to satisfy strict scrutiny, I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See also Nissimov, UT To Resume Factoring in Applicants\xe2\x80\x99 Race: UT To Reintroduce Race-Based Criteria, Houston Chronicle, June 24, 2003, p. 4A (\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Larry Faulkner said Monday his institution will quickly develop race-based admissions criteria by the fall that would be used for the summer and fall of 2004, after being given the green light to do so by Monday\xe2\x80\x99s U.\xc2\xa0S.

If this policy was in place when UT resumed race-conscious admissions in 2004, then it still had these materials when petitioner filed this suit in 2008, and likely still had them at the time of <i>Fisher I</i> in 2013.
