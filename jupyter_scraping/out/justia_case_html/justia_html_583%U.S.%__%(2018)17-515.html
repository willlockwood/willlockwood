Prior to <i>Tackett</i>, the Sixth Circuit purported to follow this rule, but it used a unique series of \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Yard-Man </i>inferences\xe2\x80\x9d that no other circuit applied.  574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)<i>.</i>  For example, the Sixth Circuit presumed that \xe2\x80\x9ca general durational clause\xe2\x80\x9d in a collective-bargaining agreement \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>says nothing</i> about the vesting of retiree benefits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in that agreement.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310) (quoting <i>Noe</i> v. <i>PolyOne Corp.</i>, 520 F.\xc2\xa03d 548, 555 (CA6 2008)).

In fact, the Sixth Circuit had followed this principle in cases involving noncollectively bargained agreements, see <i>Sprague</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.</i>, 133 F.\xc2\xa03d 388, 400 (1998) (en banc), which \xe2\x80\x9conly underscore[d] <i>Yard-Man</i>\xe2\x80\x99s deviation from ordinary principles of contract law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tackett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for the tying of retiree benefits to pensioner status, <i>Tackett </i>rejected this <i>Yard-Man </i>inference as \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination\xe2\x80\x9d in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n\n88Stat.\n891.  574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).

See <i>Tackett</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  <i>Tackett </i>thus concluded that this and the other \xe2\x80\x9cinferences applied in <i>Yard-Man</i> and its progeny\xe2\x80\x9d do not \xe2\x80\x9crepresent ordinary principles of contract law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Like <i>Tackett</i>, this case involves a dispute between retirees and their former employer about whether an expired collective-bargaining agreement created a vested right to lifetime health care benefits.  In 1998, CNH Industrial N.\xc2\xa0V. and CNH Industrial America LLC (collectively, CNH) agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement.  The 1998 agreement provided health care benefits under a group benefit plan to certain \xe2\x80\x9c[e]mployees who retire under the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Pension Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert.

The 1998 agreement contained a general durational clause stating that it would terminate in May 2004.  <i>Id.,</i> at A\xe2\x80\x93115.  The agreement also stated that it \xe2\x80\x9cdispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues, whether or not presented during negotiations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the 1998 agreement expired in 2004, a class of CNH retirees and surviving spouses (collectively, the retirees) filed this lawsuit, seeking a declaration that their health care benefits vested for life and an injunction preventing CNH from changing them.  While their lawsuit was pending, this Court decided <i>Tackett</i>.  Based on <i>Tackett</i>, the District Court initially awarded summary judgment to CNH.  But after reconsideration, it awarded summary judgment to the retirees.  143 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 609 (ED Mich. 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Sixth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  854 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 879.  The court began by noting that the 1998 agreement was \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on whether health care benefits vested for life.  <i>Id.,</i> at 882.  Although the agreement contained a general durational clause, the Sixth Circuit found that clause inconclusive for two reasons.  First, the 1998 agreement \xe2\x80\x9ccarved out certain benefits\xe2\x80\x9d like life insurance \xe2\x80\x9cand stated that those coverages ceased at a time different than other provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x93116.  Second, the 1998 agreement \xe2\x80\x9ctied\xe2\x80\x9d health care benefits to pension eligibility.  854 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 882; see App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x93116.  These conditions rendered the 1998 agreement ambiguous, according to the Sixth Circuit, which allowed it to consult extrinsic evidence.  854 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 883.  And that evidence supported lifetime vesting.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that these features of the agreement are the same ones it used to \xe2\x80\x9cinfer vesting\xe2\x80\x9d under <i>Yard-Man</i>, but it concluded that nothing in <i>Tackett </i>precludes this kind of analysis: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is surely a difference between finding ambiguity from silence and finding vesting from silence.\xe2\x80\x9d  854 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 882.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Sutton dissented.  See <i>id.,</i> at 887\xe2\x80\x93893.  He concluded that the 1998 agreement was unambiguous because \xe2\x80\x9cthe company never promised to provide healthcare benefits for life, and the agreement contained a durational clause that limited <i>all</i> of the benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 888.  Judge Sutton noted that, in finding ambiguity, the panel major- ity relied on the same inferences that this Court proscribed in <i>Tackett</i>.  See 854 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890\xe2\x80\x93891.  But ambiguity, he explained, requires \xe2\x80\x9ctwo competing interpretations, both of which are fairly plausible,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 890, and \xe2\x80\x9c[a] forbidden inference cannot generate a plausible reading,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 891.  The panel majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision, Judge Sutton concluded, <i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>abrad[ed] an inter-circuit split (and an intra-circuit split) that the Supreme Court just sutured shut.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 890.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The decision below does not comply with <i>Tackett\xe2\x80\x99s</i> direction to apply ordinary contract principles.  True, one such principle is that, when a contract is ambiguous, courts can consult extrinsic evidence to determine the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intentions.  See 574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa730:7, pp. 116\xe2\x80\x93124 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston)).  But a contract is not ambiguous unless, \xe2\x80\x9cafter applying established rules of interpretation, [it] remains reasonably susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., \xc2\xa730:4, at 53\xe2\x80\x9354 (footnote omitted).  Here, that means the 1998 agreement was not ambiguous unless it could reasonably be read as vesting health care benefits for life.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Sixth Circuit read it that way only by employing the inferences that this Court rejected in <i>Tackett</i>.  The Sixth Circuit did not point to any explicit terms, implied terms, or industry practice suggesting that the 1998 agreement vested health care benefits for life.  Cf. 574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  Instead, it found ambiguity in the 1998 agreement by applying several of the <i>Yard-Man </i>inferences: It declined to apply the general durational clause to the health care benefits, and then it inferred vesting from the presence of specific termination provisions for other benefits and the tying of health care benefits to pensioner status.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Tackett</i> rejected those inferences precisely because they are not \xe2\x80\x9cestablished rules of interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d 11\xc2\xa0Williston \xc2\xa730:4, at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  The <i>Yard-Man </i>inferences \xe2\x80\x9cdistort the text of the agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d fail \xe2\x80\x9cto apply general durational clauses,\xe2\x80\x9d erroneously presume lifetime vesting from silence, and contradict how \xe2\x80\x9cCongress specifically defined\xe2\x80\x9d key terms in ERISA.  <i>Tackett</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9314).  <i>Tackett </i>thus rejected these inferences not because of the <i>consequences</i> that the Sixth Circuit attached to them\xe2\x80\x94presuming vesting versus finding ambiguity\xe2\x80\x94but because they are not a valid way to read a contract.  They cannot be used to create a reasonable interpretation any more than they can be used to create a presumptive one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Tellingly, no other Court of Appeals would find ambigu- ity in these circumstances.  When a collective-bargaining agreement is merely silent on the question of vesting, other courts would conclude that it does <i>not </i>vest benefits for life.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Similarly, when an agreement does not specify a duration for health care benefits in particular, other courts would simply apply the general durational clause.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  And other courts would not find ambiguity from the tying of retiree benefits to pensioner status.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The approach taken in these other decisions \xe2\x80\x9conly underscores\xe2\x80\x9d how the decision below \xe2\x80\x9cdeviat[ed] from ordinary principles of contract law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tackett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shorn of <i>Yard-Man</i> inferences, this case is straightforward.  The 1998 agreement contained a general durational clause that applied to all benefits, unless the agreement specified otherwise.  No provision specified that the health care benefits were subject to a different durational clause.  The agreement stated that the health benefits plan \xe2\x80\x9cr[an] concurrently\xe2\x80\x9d with the collective-bargaining agreement, tying the health care benefits to the duration of the rest of the agreement.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x93114.  If the parties meant to vest health care benefits for life, they easily could have said so in the text.  But they did not.  And they specified that their agreement \xe2\x80\x9cdispose[d] of any and all bargaining issues\xe2\x80\x9d between them.  <i>Id.,</i> at A\xe2\x80\x93115.  Thus, the only reasonable interpretation of the 1998 agree- ment is that the health care benefits expired when the collective-bargaining agreement expired in May 2004. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the intent of the parties is unambiguously expressed in the contract, that expression controls, and the court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry should proceed no further.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tackett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (citing 11 Williston \xc2\xa730:6, at 98\xe2\x80\x93104).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because the decision below is not consistent with <i>Tackett</i>, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motions for leave to file briefs <i>amici curiae</i> are granted.
