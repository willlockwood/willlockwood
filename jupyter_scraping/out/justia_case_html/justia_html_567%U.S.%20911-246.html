Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recognized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its behalf a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band intended to use \xe2\x80\x9cfor gaming purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Secretary took title to the Bradley Property in 2009.  Respondent David Patchak, who lives near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), asserting that \xc2\xa7465 did not authorize the Secretary to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.  Patchak alleged a variety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of the Band\xe2\x80\x99s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and requested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take title to the land.  The Band intervened to defend the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The District Court did not reach the merits of Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to challenge the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of the Bradley Property.  The D.\xc2\xa0C.

The APA\xe2\x80\x99s general waiver of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cif any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought\xe2\x80\x9d by the plaintiff.  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702.  The Government and Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute.  The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a \xe2\x80\x9cright, title, or interest\xe2\x80\x9d in real property that conflicts with a \xe2\x80\x9cright, title, or interest\xe2\x80\x9d the United States claims.  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72409a(d).  But it contains an exception for \xe2\x80\x9ctrust or restricted Indian lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72409a(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo determine whether the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception bars Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of grievance Patchak advances.  It does not, because Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s action is not a quiet title action.  The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of \xe2\x80\x9cquiet title\xe2\x80\x9d actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else\xe2\x80\x99s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed property.  Although Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit contests the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s title, it does not claim any competing interest in the Bradley Property.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA does not more broadly encompass any \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72409(a).  Rather, \xc2\xa72409a includes a host of indications that the \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit.  The Band and Government also contend that the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s specific authorization of adverse claimants\xe2\x80\x99 suits creates the negative implication that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government ownership of land under any statute.  That argument is faulty for the reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses.  Finally, the Band and Government argue that Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit should be treated the same as an adverse claimant\xe2\x80\x99s because both equally implicate the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  That argument must be addressed to Congress.  The \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99s judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\xe2\x80\x94not all suits challenging the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of property.

A person suing under the APA must assert an interest that is \xe2\x80\x9carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute\xe2\x80\x9d that he says was violated.  Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, \n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150\n.  The Government and Band claim that Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s economic, environmental, and aesthetic injuries are not within \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s injuries relate to the land\xe2\x80\x99s use as a casino.  However, \xc2\xa7465 has far more to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s land provisions, and functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\xe2\x80\x99 economic development.  The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye toward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.  The Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulations make this statutory concern with land use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.  And because \xc2\xa7465 encompasses land\xe2\x80\x99s use, neighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonable\xe2\x80\x95indeed, predictable\xe2\x80\x95challengers of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental, or aesthetic, come within \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory ambit.

Although the Band has a long history, the Department of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in 1999.  See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998).  Two years later, the Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority under \xc2\xa7465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland Township, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property.  The Band\xe2\x80\x99s application explained that the Band would use the property \xe2\x80\x9cfor gaming purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d with the goal of generating the \xe2\x80\x9crevenue necessary to promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal government capable of providing its members with sorely needed social and educational programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 52, 41.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the Secretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley Property in trust for the Band.  See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.  In accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary committed to wait 30 days before taking action, so that interested parties could seek judicial review.  See ibid.; 25 CFR \xc2\xa7151.12(b) (2011).  Within that window, an organization called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO) filed suit alleging that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision violated environmental and gaming statutes.  The Secretary held off taking title to the property while that litigation proceeded.  Within the next few years, a District Court and the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit rejected MichGO\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  See Michigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F.\xc2\xa03d 23, 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (CADC 2008); Michigan Gambling Opposition v.

Circuit ruled against MichGO (but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this suit under the APA advancing a different legal theory.  He asserted that \xc2\xa7465 did not authorize the Secretary to acquire property for the Band because it was not a feder- ally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.  See App. 37.  To establish his standing to bring suit, Patchak contended that he lived \xe2\x80\x9cin close proximity to\xe2\x80\x9d the Bradley Property and that a casino there would \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the lifestyle he has enjoyed\xe2\x80\x9d by causing \xe2\x80\x9cincreased traffic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cincreased crime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdecreased property values,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9can irreversible change in the rural character of the area,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  Notably, Patchak did not assert any claim of his own to the Bradley Property.  He requested only a declaration that the decision to acquire the land violated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary from accepting title.  See id., at 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  The Band intervened in the suit to defend the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed suit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO\xe2\x80\x99s case, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1137\n, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property into trust.  That action mooted Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s request for an injunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Government of title to the land.  See Brief for Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (hereinafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11; Brief for Respondent 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  The month after the Government took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379, \n382 (2009)\n, that \xc2\xa7465 authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust only for tribes that were \xe2\x80\x9cunder federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in 1934.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court dismissed the suit without considering the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling that Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of the Bradley Property.  The court reasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  646 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC 2009).  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit reversed that determination.  See 632 F.\xc2\xa03d 702, 704\xe2\x80\x93707 (2011).  The court also rejected the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s and the Band\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that by virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.  See id., at 707\xe2\x80\x93712.  The latter ruling conflicted with decisions of three Circuits holding that the United States has immunity from suits like Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s.  See Neighbors for Rational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F.\xc2\xa03d 956, 961\xe2\x80\x93962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern\xc2\xa0Cal. v.

That requires us first to look to the APA itself and then, for reasons we will describe, to the QTA.  We conclude that the United States has waived its sovereign immunity from Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe APA generally waives the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from a suit \xe2\x80\x9cseeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702.  That waiver would appear to cover Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit, which objects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only non-monetary relief.  But the APA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity comes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cif any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought\xe2\x80\x9d by the plaintiff.  Ibid.  That provision prevents plaintiffs from exploiting the APA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver to evade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.  The question thus becomes whether another statute bars Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s demand for relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government and Band contend that the QTA does so.  The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from) a particular type of action, known as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting a \xe2\x80\x9cright, title, or interest\xe2\x80\x9d in real property that conflicts with a \xe2\x80\x9cright, title, or interest\xe2\x80\x9d the United States claims.  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72409a(d).  The statute, however, contains an exception: The QTA\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of suit \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72409a(a).  According to the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title suits satisfies the APA\xe2\x80\x99s carve-out and so forbids Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  In the Band\xe2\x80\x99s words, the QTA exception retains \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States\xe2\x80\x99 full immunity from suits seeking to challenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo hypothetical examples might help to frame consideration of this argument.  First, suppose Patchak had sued under the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Property and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into trust.  The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just suggested.  True, it fits within the APA\xe2\x80\x99s general waiver, but the QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which this hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian lands (which this hypothetical suit does).  In such a circumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress has dealt in par- ticularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified remedy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including its exceptions\xe2\x80\x94to be exclusive, that is the end of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.  Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 273, \n286, n. \n22 (1983)\n (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

The QTA could not bar that suit because even though involving Indian lands, it asserts a grievance altogether different from the kind the statute concerns.  Justice Scalia, in a former life as Assistant Attorney General, made this precise point in a letter to Congress about the APA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity (which we hasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative history, but only for its persuasive force).  When a statute \xe2\x80\x9cis not addressed to the type of grievance which the plaintiff seeks to assert,\xe2\x80\x9d then the statute cannot prevent an APA suit.  Id., at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant Atty. Gen. A. Scalia).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe think that principle controls Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s case: The QTA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d clause does not render the Government immune because the QTA addresses a kind of grievance different from the one Patchak advances.  As we will explain, the QTA\xe2\x80\x94whose full name, recall, is the Quiet Title Act\xe2\x80\x94concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.  And Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not a quiet title action, because although it contests the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s title, it does not claim any competing interest in the Bradley Property.  That fact makes the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d limitation simply inapposite to this litigation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn reaching this conclusion, we need look no further than the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s text.  From its title to its jurisdictional grant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and repeatedly of \xe2\x80\x9cquiet title\xe2\x80\x9d actions.  See \n\n86Stat.\n1176 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn Act [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions\xe2\x80\x9d); \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(f) (giving district courts jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ccivil actions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to quiet title\xe2\x80\x9d to property in which the United States claims an interest); \xc2\xa71402(d) (setting forth venue for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny civil action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to quiet title\xe2\x80\x9d to property in which the United States claims an interest).  That term is universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else\xe2\x80\x99s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed property.  See, e.g., Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (defining an \xe2\x80\x9caction to quiet title\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] proceeding to establish a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s title to land by compelling the adverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever estopped from asserting it\xe2\x80\x9d); Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v.

Walker, \n\n244 U.\xc2\xa0S. 486, \n490 (1917)\n)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions make clear that the recurrent statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cquiet title action\xe2\x80\x9d carries its or- dinary meaning.  The QTA directs that the complaint in such an action \xe2\x80\x9cshall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims in the real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72409a(d).  If the plaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does not), the statute cannot come into play.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Further, the QTA provides an option for the United States, if it loses the suit, to pay \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than return the property, to the \xe2\x80\x9cperson determined to be entitled\xe2\x80\x9d to it.  \xc2\xa72409a(b).  That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet title action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property, the Government can satisfy his claim through an award of money (while still retaining the land for its operations).  But the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one, where Patchak does not assert a right to the property.  If the United States loses the suit, an award of just compensation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he might be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as addressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an ownership interest in Government-held property.  In Block v. North Dakota ex\xc2\xa0rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 273 (1982)\n, we considered North Dakota\xe2\x80\x99s claim to land that the United States viewed as its own.  We held that the State could not circumvent the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations by invoking other causes of action, among them the APA.  See id., at 277\xe2\x80\x93278, 286, n. 22.  The crux of our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA to address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had brought.  Prior to the QTA, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens asserting title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by the United States\xe2\x80\x9d had no recourse; by passing the statute, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress sought to rectify this state of affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 282.  Our decision reflected that legislative purpose: Congress, we held, \xe2\x80\x9cintended the QTA to provide the exclusive means by which adverse claimants could challenge the United States\xe2\x80\x99 title to real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 286.  We repeat: \xe2\x80\x9cadverse claimants,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning plaintiffs who themselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision in United States v. Mottaz, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 834 (1986)\n, is of a piece.  There, we considered whether the QTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act, governed the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit respecting certain allotments of land held by the United States.  We thought the QTA the relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted title to the property.  Our opinion quoted the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own description of her suit: \xe2\x80\x9cAt no time in this proceeding did [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title.  To the contrary, the claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent in Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p.\xc2\xa03).  That fact, we held, brought the suit \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the [QTA\xe2\x80\x99s] scope\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat [the plaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses valid title.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 842.  So once again, we construed the QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Patchak is not an adverse claimant\xe2\x80\x94and so the QTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign immunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot bar his suit.  Patchak does not contend that he owns the Bradley Property, nor does he seek any relief corresponding to such a claim.  He wants a court to strip the United States of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is his and not so that he can possess it.  Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit therefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action.  He is not trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to circumvent the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  Rather, he is not bringing a QTA suit at all.  He asserts merely that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take land into trust violates a federal statute\xe2\x80\x94a garden-variety APA claim.  See 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7706(2)(A), (C) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe reviewing court shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. hold unlawful and set aside agency action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not in accordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because that is true\xe2\x80\x94because in then-Assistant Attorney General Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s words, the QTA is \xe2\x80\x9cnot addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak] seeks to assert,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. 94\xe2\x80\x931656, at\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x94the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of remedies has no bearing.  The APA\xe2\x80\x99s general waiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Band and Government, along with the dissent, object to this conclusion on three basic grounds.  First, they contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we have indicated, waiving immunity from suits \xe2\x80\x9cto adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72409a(a).  That language, the argument goes, encompasses all actions contesting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legal interest in land, regardless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself.  See Brief for Federal Petitioners 19\xe2\x80\x9320; Reply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 4\xe2\x80\x936; post, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  The QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute after all\xe2\x80\x94as to both its waiver and its \xe2\x80\x9ccorresponding\xe2\x80\x9d reservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.  Reply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the Band and Government can reach that result only by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.  That sentence, more fully quoted, reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72409a(a) (emphasis added).  And as we have already noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa72409a\xe2\x80\x94includes a host of indications that the \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit: Just recall the section\xe2\x80\x99s title (\xe2\x80\x9cReal property quiet title actions\xe2\x80\x9d), and its pleading requirements (the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cshall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which [he] claims\xe2\x80\x9d), and its permission to the Government to remedy an infraction by paying \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Read with reference to all these provisions (as well as to the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s contemporane ously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver clause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band\xe2\x80\x99s and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument: That clause speaks not to any suit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government\xe2\x80\x99s title, but only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an interest in the property.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Band and Government next invoke cases holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a statute provides a detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of particular persons,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute may \xe2\x80\x9cimpliedly preclude[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d judicial review \xe2\x80\x9cof those issues at the behest of other persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Block v.

Here, the Band and Government contend, the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s specific authorization of adverse claimants\xe2\x80\x99 suits creates a negative implication: non-adverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government ownership of land under any other statute.  See Reply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7\xe2\x80\x9310; Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners 7\xe2\x80\x939; see also post, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  The QTA, says the Band, thus \xe2\x80\x9cpreempts [Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s] more general remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases inapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses.  See supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310.  To see the point, consider a contrasting example.  Suppose the QTA authorized suit only by adverse claimants who could assert a property interest of at least a decade\xe2\x80\x99s duration.  Then suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that requirement (because, say, his claim to title went back only five years) brought suit under a general statute like the APA.  We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases the Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary statute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could bring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude others from doing so.  But here, once again, Patchak is not bringing a quiet title action at all.  He is not claiming to own the property, and he is not demanding that the court transfer the property to him.  So to succeed in their argument, the Government and Band must go much further than the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing one person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of relief, Congress barred another person from bringing another kind of suit seeking another form of relief.  Presumably, that contention would extend only to suits involving similar subject matter\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of property.  But that commonality is not itself sufficient.  We have never held, and see no cause to hold here, that some general similarity of subject matter can alone trigger a remedial statute\xe2\x80\x99s preclusive effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLast, the Band and Government argue that we should treat Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit as we would an adverse claimant\xe2\x80\x99s because they equally implicate the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  According to the Government, allowing challenges to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s trust acquisitions would \xe2\x80\x9cpose significant barriers to tribes[\xe2\x80\x99] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ability to promote investment and economic development on the lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Petitioners 24.  That harm is the same whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.  Indeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this suit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants like Patchak have \xe2\x80\x9cthe most remote injuries and indirect interests in the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11\xe2\x80\x9312; see also post, at 2, 7, 10.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat argument is not without force, but it must be addressed to Congress.  In the QTA, Congress made a judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\xe2\x80\x94to a point, but no further.  (The \xe2\x80\x9cno further\xe2\x80\x9d includes not only the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands\xe2\x80\x9d exception, but one for security interests and water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar on jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and the just compensation option discussed earlier.)  Perhaps Congress would\xe2\x80\x94perhaps Congress should\xe2\x80\x94make the identical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of land.  But that is not our call.  The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak have a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title actions, and so should be precluded a\xc2\xa0fortiori.  But all we can say is that Patchak has a different interest.  Whether it is lesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property rights; whether it is greater because implicating public interests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same\xe2\x80\x94that is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.  As the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to quiet title actions all other suits challenging the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of property.  And so when a plaintiff like Patchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the APA\xe2\x80\x99s general waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe finally consider the Band\xe2\x80\x99s and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this ac- tion because he lacks prudential standing.  This Court has long held that a person suing under the APA must satisfy not only Article III\xe2\x80\x99s standing requirements, but an additional test: The interest he asserts must be \xe2\x80\x9carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute\xe2\x80\x9d that he says was violated.  Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, \n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150, \n153 (1970)\n.  Here, Patchak asserts that in taking title to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her authority under \xc2\xa7465, which authorizes the acquisition of property \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him economic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby property owner.  See supra, at 3.  The Government and Band argue that the relationship between \xc2\xa7465 and Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interests is insufficient.  That is so, they contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisition, whereas Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s interests relate to the land\xe2\x80\x99s use as a casino.  See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any particular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . .

Start with what we and others have said about \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s context and purpose.  As the leading treatise on federal Indian law notes, \xc2\xa7465 is \xe2\x80\x9cthe capstone\xe2\x80\x9d of the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s land provisions.  F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \xc2\xa715.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).  And those provisions play a key role in the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s overall effort \xe2\x80\x9cto rehabilitate the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s economic life,\xe2\x80\x9d Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, \n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145, \n152 (1973)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cLand forms the basis\xe2\x80\x9d of that \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic life,\xe2\x80\x9d providing the foundation for \xe2\x80\x9ctourism, manufacturing, mining, logging,\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and gaming.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohen \xc2\xa715.01, at 965.  Section 465 thus functions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\xe2\x80\x99 economic development.  As the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit explained in the MichGO litigation, the section \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[es] lands sufficient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.\xe2\x80\x9d  Michigan Gambling, 525 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Morton v. Mancari, \n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535, \n542 (1974)\n (noting the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s economic aspect).  So when the Secretary obtains land for Indians under \xc2\xa7465, she does not do so in a vacuum.  Rather, she takes title to properties with at least one eye directed toward how tribes will use those lands to support economic development.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulations make this statutory concern with land use crystal clear.  Those regulations permit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under \xc2\xa7465 if the \xe2\x80\x9cland is necessary to facilitate tribal self-determination, economic development, or Indian housing.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 CFR \xc2\xa7151.3(a)(3).  And they require the Secretary to consider, in evaluating any acquisition, both \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purposes for which the land will be used\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpoten- tial conflicts of land use which may arise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7151.10(c), 151.10(f); see \xc2\xa7151.11(a).

DOI\xe2\x80\x99s regulations thus show that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s implementation centrally depends on the projected use of a given property.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of the Bradley Property is a case in point.  The Band\xe2\x80\x99s application to the Secretary highlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.  See App. 41 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]rust status for this Property is requested in order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans to conduct gaming\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Tribe intends to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. renovate the existing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. building into a gaming fa- cility .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming\xe2\x80\x9d).  Simi- larly, DOI\xe2\x80\x99s notice of intent to take the land into trust announced that the land would \xe2\x80\x9cbe used for the purpose of construction and operation of a gaming facility,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Department had already determined would meet the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  70 Fed.

So from start to finish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop- erty under \xc2\xa7465 involved questions of land use.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd because \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s implementation encompasses these issues, the interests Patchak raises\xe2\x80\x94at least arguably\xe2\x80\x94 fall \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the zone .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. protected or regulated by the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the Government had violated a statute specifically addressing how federal land can be used, no one would doubt that a neighboring landowner would have prudential standing to bring suit to enforce the statute\xe2\x80\x99s limits.  The difference here, as the Government and Band point out, is that \xc2\xa7465 specifically addresses only land ac- quisition.  But for the reasons already given, decisions under the statute are closely enough and often enough entwined with considerations of land use to make that difference immaterial.  As in this very case, the Secretary will typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.  See 25 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7151.10(c), 151.10(f), 151.11(a).  And so neighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonable\xe2\x80\x94indeed, predictable\xe2\x80\x94challengers of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decisions:  Their interests, whether economic, environmental, or aesthetic, come within \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory ambit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe QTA\xe2\x80\x99s reservation of sovereign immunity does not bar Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit.

Suppose, for example, that Congress passed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a procurement contract suit except when the suit involved a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary function\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal employee.  Cf. 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.  \xc2\xa72680(a).  Under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit seeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary function, no matter what the nature of the claim.

As we have explained, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to restrict the class entitled to relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the remainder.  See, e.g., Block v.

If a plaintiff could oust the Government of title to land by means of an APA action, \xe2\x80\x9call of the carefully crafted provisions of the QTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national public interest could be averted,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian lands exception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Block, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 284\xe2\x80\x93285.  We therefore had little difficulty concluding that Congress did not intend to render the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the right to dispute the Government\xe2\x80\x99s title to any lands by way of an APA action\xe2\x80\x94and to empower any such plaintiff to \xe2\x80\x9cdisposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed prop- erty without being afforded the option of paying damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 285.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the conditions to sue under the QTA.  He seeks to challenge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he seeks to force the Government to relinquish possession and title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compensation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal right, title, or interest in the property (strike three).  Thus, by its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak seeks.  Compare ante, at 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll parties agree that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Government of title to the [Indian trust] land\xe2\x80\x9d), with United States v. Mottaz, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 834, \n842 (1986)\n (Section 2409a(a)\xe2\x80\x99s Indian lands exclusion \xe2\x80\x9coperates solely to retain the United States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suit by third parties challenging the United States\xe2\x80\x99 title to land held in trust for Indians\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consequently, Patchak may not avoid the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s constraints by suing under the APA, a statute enacted only four years later.

The relief Patchak admittedly seeks\xe2\x80\x94to oust the Government of title to Indian trust land\xe2\x80\x94is identical to that forbidden by the QTA.  Conversely, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical suit, alleging that the Bradley Property was causing environmental harm, would not be barred by the QTA.  See ante, at 6.  That is not because such an action asserts a different \xe2\x80\x9cgrievance,\xe2\x80\x9d but because it seeks different relief\xe2\x80\x94abatement of a nuisance rather than the extinguishment of title.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the \xe2\x80\x9cgrievance\xe2\x80\x9d Patchak asserts is no different from that asserted in Block\xe2\x80\x94a case in which we unanimously rejected a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to avoid the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions by way of an APA action or the similar device of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s suit.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That action, like this one, was styled as a suit claiming that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s actions respecting land were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cnot within [its] statutory powers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281.

But that is no reason to imagine that Congress intended a different outcome.  As the majority itself acknowledges, the harm to the United States and tribes when a plaintiff sues to extinguish the Government\xe2\x80\x99s title to Indian trust land is identical \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  Yet, if the majority is correct, Congress intended the APA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity to apply to those hypothetical plaintiffs differently.  Congress, it suggests, intended to permit anyone to circumvent the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s careful limitations and sue to force the Government to relinquish Indian trust lands\xe2\x80\x94anyone, that is, except those with the strongest entitlement to bring such actions: those claiming a personal \xe2\x80\x9cright, title, or interest\xe2\x80\x9d in the land in question.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion hinges, therefore, on the doubtful premise that Congress intended to waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity wholesale for those like Patchak, who assert an \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic\xe2\x80\x9d interest in land, ante, at 1, while retaining the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immu- nity against those who assert a constitutional interest in land\xe2\x80\x94the deprivation of property without due process of law.  This is highly implausible.  Unsurprisingly, the majority does not even attempt to explain why Congress would have intended this counterintuitive result.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no further than an \xe2\x80\x9cordinary quiet title suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  The action permitted by \xc2\xa72409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit.  At common law, equity courts \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[ted] a bill to quiet title to be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a defendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to establish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wehrman v. Conklin, \n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 314\n\xe2\x80\x93322 (1894) (emphasis added).  Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither prerequisite.  Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante, at 7, an act to quiet title is \xe2\x80\x9cuniversally understood\xe2\x80\x9d as a proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cto establish a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s title to land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added).  But \xc2\xa72409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither the Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land at issue.  See \xc2\xa72409a(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe complaint shall set forth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  A plaintiff may file suit under \xc2\xa72409a, for instance, when he claims only an easement in land, the right to explore an area for minerals, or some other lesser right or interest.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x93575, at 5.  Notwithstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly allows suit in circumstances well beyond \xe2\x80\x9cbread-and-butter quiet title actions,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3, n.\xc2\xa03.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority attempts to bolster its reading by emphasizing an unexpected source within \xc2\xa72409a: the clause specifying that the United States may be sued \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in a civil action under this section.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  The majority understands this clause to narrow the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s scope (and its limitations on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity waiver) to quiet title claims only.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d speaks broadly to civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cto adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72409a.  Moreover, this clause is read most straightforwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to state that a claimant can file \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action under this section\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa72409a\xe2\x80\x94to adjudicate a disputed title in which the United States claims an interest.  Regardless of how one reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA\xe2\x80\x99s clear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other statutes are not authorized by the APA.  And the QTA forbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the Government to relinquish title to Indian lands.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the majority were correct that the QTA itself reached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that would establish only that the QTA does not expressly forbid the relief Patchak seeks.  The APA, however, does not waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity where any other statute \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702 (emphasis added).  The text and history of the QTA, as well as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, make clear that the United States intended to retain its sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Government of Indian trust land.  Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit to oust the Government of such land is therefore, at minimum, impliedly forbidden.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThree consequences illustrate the difficulties today\xe2\x80\x99s holding will present for courts and the Government.  First, it will render the QTA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations easily circumvented.  Although those with property claims will remain formally prohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block, savvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family member or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic\xe2\x80\x9d interest in the land but seeking an identical prac- tical objective\xe2\x80\x94to divest the Government of title and possession.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72409a(a), (b).  Nothing will prevent them from obtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding will frustrate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust decisions expeditiously.  When a plaintiff like Patchak asserts an \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cenvironmental\xe2\x80\x9d concern with a planned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct suit under statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  Those challenges generally may be brought within the APA\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations.  Suits to contest the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take title to land in trust for Indian tribes, however, have been governed by a different rule.  Until today, parties seeking to challenge such decisions had only a 30-day window to seek judi- cial review.  25 CFR \xc2\xa7151.12 (2011); 61 Fed. Reg. 18,082\xe2\x80\x9318,083 (1996).  That deadline promoted finality and security\xe2\x80\x94necessary preconditions for the investment and \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic development\xe2\x80\x9d that are central goals of the Indian Reorganization Act.

The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether its rule bars from suit only those who \xe2\x80\x9cclaim any competing interest\xe2\x80\x9d in the disputed land in their complaint, ante, at 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but plead only that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s title claim violates a federal statute.  If the former, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding would allow Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to go forward even if he had some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so long as his complaint did not assert it.  That result is difficult to square with Block and Mottaz.  If the latter, matters are even more peculiar.  Because a shrewd plaintiff will avoid referencing her own property claim in her complaint, the Government may assert sovereign immu- nity only if its detective efforts uncover the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s unstated property claim.  Not only does that impose a substantial burden on the Government, but it creates per-verse incentives for private litigants.  What if a plain- tiff has a weak claim, or a claim that she does not know about?  Did Congress really intend for the availability of APA relief to turn on whether a plaintiff does a better job of overlooking or suppressing her own property interest than the Government does of sleuthing it out?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs these observations illustrate, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule will impose a substantial burden on the Government and leave an array of uncertainties.  Moreover, it will open to suit lands that Congress and the Executive Branch thought the \xe2\x80\x9cnational public interest\xe2\x80\x9d demanded should remain immune from challenge.
