See <i>Chicago </i>v. <i>Environmental Defense Fund, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/328/case.html">511 U. S. 328</a>, 331-332 (1994). Unlike the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 94 Stat. 2767, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 9601 <i>et seq., </i>RCRA is not principally designed to effectuate the cleanup of toxic waste sites or to compensate those who have attended to the remediation of environmental hazards. Cf. <i>General Electric Co. </i>v. <i>Litton Industrial Automation Systems, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/920/1415/">920 F.2d 1415</a>, 1422 (CA8 1990) (the "two ... main purposes of CERCLA" are "prompt cleanup of hazardous waste sites and imposition of all cleanup costs on the responsible party"). RCRA\'s primary purpose, rather, is to reduce the generation of hazardous waste and to ensure the proper treatment, storage, and disposal of that waste which is nonetheless generated, "so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6902(b).</p><p>Chief responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of RCRA rests with the Administrator of the Environ-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="484">484</a></p><p>mental Protection Agency (EPA), see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6928, 6973, but like other environmental laws, RCRA contains a citizen suit provision, \xc2\xa7 6972, which permits private citizens to enforce its provisions in some circumstances.</p><p>Two requirements of \xc2\xa7 6972(a) defeat KFC\'s suit against the Meghrigs. The first concerns the necessary timing of a citizen suit brought under \xc2\xa7 6972(a)(1)(B): That section permits a private party to bring suit against certain responsible persons, including former owners, "who ha[ve] contributed or who [are] contributing to the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which <i>may present </i>an <i>imminent </i>and substantial endangerment to health or the environment." (Emphasis added.) The second defines the remedies a district court can award in a suit brought under \xc2\xa7 6972(a)(1)(B):</p><p>Section 6972(a) authorizes district courts <i>"to restrain </i>any person who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste ... , <i>to order such person to take such other action as may be necessary, </i>or both." (Emphasis added.)</p><p>It is apparent from the two remedies described in \xc2\xa7 6972(a) that RCRA\'s citizen suit provision is not directed at providing compensation for past cleanup efforts. Under a plain reading of this remedial scheme, a private citizen suing under \xc2\xa7 6972(a)(1)(B) could seek a mandatory injunction, i. <i>e., </i>one that orders a responsible party to "take action" by attending to the cleanup and proper disposal of toxic waste, or a prohibitory injunction, i. <i>e., </i>one that "restrains" a responsible party from further violating RCRA. Neither remedy, however, is susceptible of the interpretation adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as neither contemplates the award of past cleanup costs, whether these are denominated "damages" or "equitable restitution."</p><p>In this regard, a comparison between the relief available under RCRA\'s citizen suit provision and that which Congress</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="485">485</a></p><p>has provided in the analogous, but not parallel, provisions of CERCLA is telling. CERCLA was passed several years after RCRA went into effect, and it is designed to address many of the same toxic waste problems that inspired the passage of RCRA. Compare 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6903(5) (RCRA definition of "hazardous waste") and \xc2\xa7 6903(27) (RCRA definition of "solid waste") with \xc2\xa7 9601(14) (CERCLA provision incorporating certain "hazardous substance[s]," but specifically excluding petroleum). CERCLA differs markedly from RCRA, however, in the remedies it provides. CERCLA\'s citizen suit provision mimics \xc2\xa7 6972(a) in providing district courts with the authority "to order such action as may be necessary to correct the violation" of any CERCLA standard or regulation. 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 9659(c). But CERCLA expressly permits the Government to recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," \xc2\xa7 9607(a)(4)(A), and it expressly permits the recovery of any "necessary costs of response, incurred by any ... person consistent with the national contingency plan," \xc2\xa7 9607(a)(4)(B). CERCLA also provides that "[a]ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable" for these response costs. See \xc2\xa7 9613(f)(1). Congress thus demonstrated in CERCLA that it knew how to provide for the recovery of cleanup costs, and that the language used to define the remedies under RCRA does not provide that remedy.</p><p>That RCRA\'s citizen suit provision was not intended to provide a remedy for past cleanup costs is further apparent from the harm at which it is directed. Section 6972(a)(1)(B) permits a private party to bring suit only upon a showing that the solid or hazardous waste at issue "may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment." The meaning of this timing restriction is plain:</p><p>An endangerment can only be "imminent" if it "threaten[s] to occur immediately," Webster\'s New International Dictionary of English Language 1245 (2d ed. 1934), and the refer-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="486">486</a></p><p>ence to waste which "may present" imminent harm quite clearly excludes waste that no longer presents such a danger. As the Ninth Circuit itself intimated in <i>Price </i>v. <i>United States Navy, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/39/1011/">39 F.3d 1011</a>, 1019 (1994), this language "implies that there must be a threat which is present <i>now, </i>although the impact of the threat may not be felt until later." It follows that \xc2\xa7 6972(a) was designed to provide a remedy that ameliorates present or obviates the risk of future "imminent" harms, not a remedy that compensates for past cleanup efforts. Cf. \xc2\xa7 6902(b) (national policy behind RCRA is "to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment").</p><p>Other aspects of RCRA\'s enforcement scheme strongly support this conclusion. Unlike CERCLA, RCRA contains no statute of limitations, compare \xc2\xa7 9613(g)(2) (limitations period in suits under CERCLA \xc2\xa7 9607), and it does not require a showing that the response costs being sought are reasonable, compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9607(a)( 4)(A) and (B) (costs recovered under CERCLA must be "consistent with the national contingency plan"). If Congress had intended \xc2\xa7 6972(a) to function as a cost-recovery mechanism, the absence of these provisions would be striking. Moreover, with one limited exception, see <i>Hallstrom </i>v. <i>Tillamook County, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/20/case.html">493 U. S. 20</a>, 26-27 (1989) (noting exception to notice requirement "when there is a danger that hazardous waste will be discharged"), a private party may not bring suit under \xc2\xa7 6972(a)(1)(B) without first giving 90 days\' notice to the Administrator of the EPA, to "the State in which the alleged endangerment may occur," and to potential defendants, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6972(b)(2)(A)(i)(iii). And no citizen suit can proceed if either the EPA or the State has commenced, and is diligently prosecuting, a separate enforcement action, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6972(b)(2)(B) and (C). Therefore, if RCRA were designed to compensate private parties for their past cleanup efforts, it would be a wholly irrational mechanism for doing so. Those parties with insubstantial problems, problems that neither the State nor</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="487">487</a></p><p>the Federal Government feel compelled to address, could recover their response costs, whereas those parties whose waste problems were sufficiently severe as to attract the attention of Government officials would be left without a recovery.</p><p>Though it agrees that KFC\'s complaint is defective for failing properly to allege an "imminent and substantial endangerment," the Government (as <i>amicus) </i>nonetheless joins KFC in arguing that \xc2\xa7 6972(a) does not in all circumstances preclude an award of past cleanup costs. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>22-28. The Government posits a situation in which suit is properly brought while the waste at issue continues to pose an imminent endangerment, and suggests that the plaintiff in such a case could seek equitable restitution of money previously spent on cleanup efforts. Echoing a similar argument made by KFC, see Brief for Respondent 11-19, the Government does not rely on the remedies expressly provided in \xc2\xa7 6972(a), but rather cites a line of cases holding that district courts retain inherent authority to award any equitable remedy that is not expressly taken away from them by Congress. See, <i>e. g., Porter </i>v. <i>Warner Holding Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/395/case.html">328 U. S. 395</a> (1946); <i>Wyandotte Transp. Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/191/case.html">389 U. S. 191</a> (1967); <i>Hecht Co. </i>v. <i>Bowles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/321/case.html">321 U. S. 321</a> (1944).</p><p>RCRA does not prevent a private party from recovering its cleanup costs under other federal or state laws, see \xc2\xa7 6972(f) (preserving remedies under statutory and common law), but the limited remedies described in \xc2\xa7 6972(a), along with the stark differences between the language of that section and the cost recovery provisions of CERCLA, amply demonstrate that Congress did not intend for a private citizen to be able to undertake a cleanup and then proceed to recover its costs under RCRA. As we explained in <i>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority </i>v. <i>National Sea Clammers Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a>, 14 (1981), where Congress has provided "elaborate enforcement provisions" for remedying the viola-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="488">488</a></p><p>tion of a federal statute, as Congress has done with RCRA and CERCLA, "it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing under" the statute. "\'[I]t is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 14-15 (quoting <i>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. </i>v. <i>Lewis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html">444 U. S. 11</a>, 19 (1979)).</p><p>Without considering whether a private party could seek to obtain an injunction requiring another party to pay cleanup costs which arise after a RCRA citizen suit has been properly commenced, cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Price, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/688/204/">688 F.2d 204</a>, 211-213 (CA3 1982) (requiring funding of a diagnostic study is an appropriate form of relief in a suit brought by the Administrator under \xc2\xa7 6973), or otherwise recover cleanup costs paid out after the invocation of RCRA\'s statutory process, we agree with the Meghrigs that a private party cannot recover the cost of a <i>past </i>cleanup effort under RCRA, and that KFC\'s complaint is defective for the reasons stated by the District Court. Section 6972(a) does not contemplate the award of past cleanup costs, and \xc2\xa7 6972(a)(1)(B) permits a private party to bring suit only upon an allegation that the contaminated site presently poses an "imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment," and not upon an allegation that it posed such an endangerment at some time in the past. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
