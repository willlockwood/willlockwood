Following several hearings, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA).  The statute provides a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9c(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of \xe2\x80\xa6 (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  The statute similarly provides a 5-year sentence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii).  \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).  The District Court declined DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s request that the jury be instructed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.  DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120 months in prison mandated by the statute.  The First Circuit affirmed, rejecting DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine.  Instead, it adhered to its precedent holding that \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d refers to all forms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1), means not just \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d but cocaine in its chemically basic form.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (iii) is cocaine in its chemically basic form\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the molecule found in crack cocaine, freebase, and coca paste.  On its plain terms, then, \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine.  In arguing to the contrary, DePierre urges the Court to stray far from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, which nowhere contains the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, on the other hand, follows the words Congress chose to use.  DePierre is correct that \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d is technically redundant\xe2\x80\x94chemically speaking, cocaine <em>is</em> a base.  But Congress had good reason to use \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride (<em>i.e.</em>, powder cocaine) or other nonbasic cocaine-related substances.  At the time the statute was enacted, \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d was commonly used to refer to powder cocaine, and the scientific and medical literature often uses \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to <em>all</em> cocaine-related substances, including ones that are not chemically basic.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This reading of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d is also consistent with \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat confusing structure.  Subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) lists \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d along with \xe2\x80\x9cits salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers,\xe2\x80\x9d as elements subject to clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s higher quantity threshold.  DePierre is correct that, because \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d both refer to chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized according to the lower quantity threshold of clause (iii), and never the higher threshold clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances containing \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court does not agree that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii) is therefore superfluous\xe2\x80\x94in light of the structure of subclause (II), \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d is needed as the reference point for \xe2\x80\x9csalts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cisomers,\xe2\x80\x9d which would otherwise be meaningless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii) also performs another critical function.  Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, clause (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for a subset of those substances\xe2\x80\x94the ones that \xe2\x80\x9ccontai[n] cocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  For this structure to work, however, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1) must \xe2\x80\x9cdescrib[e] in clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x9d substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the subset described in clause (iii).  Congress thus had good reason to include the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii), and the slight inconsistency created by its use of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (iii) is insufficient reason to adopt DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments are unpersuasive.  First, the records of the 1986 congressional hearings do not support his contention that Congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving crack cocaine.  Second, reading \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to mean chemically basic cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, does not lead to an absurd result.  Third, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is defined as \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d does not require that the statutory term be interpreted the same way.  Fourth, the statute is sufficiently clear that the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s favor.

This case requires us to decide whether the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d as used in this statute refers generally to cocaine in its chemically basic form or exclusively to what is colloquially known as \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d means the former.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a matter of chemistry, cocaine is an alkaloid with the molecular formula C<font super="-1">17H<font super="-1">21NO<font super="-1">4.

Cocaine is derived from the coca plant native to South America.  The leaves of the coca plant can be processed with water, kerosene, sodium car-bonate, and sulphuric acid to produce a paste-like substance.  R. Weiss, S. Mirin, &amp; R. Bartel, Cocaine 10 (2d\ned. 1994).  When dried, the resulting \xe2\x80\x9ccoca paste\xe2\x80\x9d can be vaporized (through the application of heat) and inhaled, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9csmoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (1995) (hereinafter Commission Report).

Cocaine hydrochloride, therefore, is not a base.  It generally comes in powder form, which we will refer to as \xe2\x80\x9cpowder cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is usually insufflated (breathed in through the nose), though it can also be ingested or diluted in water and injected.  Because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a much higher temperature than chemically basic cocaine (at which point the cocaine molecule tends to decompose), it is generally not smoked.

The chemical reaction changes the cocaine hydrochloride molecule into a chemically basic cocaine molecule, Physicians Brief 4, and the resulting solid substance can be cooled and broken into small pieces and then smoked, Commission Report 14.  This substance is commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Alternatively, powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and ammonia (also a base); with the addition of ether, a solid substance\xe2\x80\x94known as \xe2\x80\x9cfreebase\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94separates from the solu-tion, and can be smoked.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.  As with crack cocaine, freebase contains cocaine in its chemically basic form.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chemically, therefore, there is no difference between the cocaine in coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase\xe2\x80\x94all are cocaine in its base form.  On the other hand, cocaine in its base form and in its salt form (<em>i.e.</em>, cocaine hydrochloride) are chemically different, though they have the same active ingredient and produce the same physiological and psychotropic effects.  See <em>id.</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9322.  The key difference between them is the method by which they generally enter the body; smoking cocaine in its base form\xe2\x80\x94whether as coca paste, freebase, or crack cocaine\xe2\x80\x94allows the body to absorb the active ingredient quickly, thereby producing a shorter, more intense high than obtained from insufflating cocaine hydrochloride.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see generally <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/85/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/85/index.html">552 U.

See <em>id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  At the time, federal law generally tied the penalties for drug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity involved, with no pro-vision for mandatory minimum sentences.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III).  After holding several hearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack cocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA), 100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory minimum sentences for controlled-substance offenses in-volving specific quantities of drugs.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10-year sentence for certain drug offenses involving 5 kilograms or more of \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d various cocaine-related elements, including coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts; it also called for the same sentence for offenses involving only\n50 grams or more of \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>which contains cocaine base</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  ADAA, \xc2\xa71002, 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x932 (amending \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(iii)) (emphasis added).  The ADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for offenses involving 500 grams of a mixture or substance containing coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5 grams of a mixture or substance containing \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3207\xe2\x80\x933 (amending \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(iii)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio for the threshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that triggered the statute\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum penalties.  That is, 5 grams or more of \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance \xe2\x80\xa6 which contains cocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d was penalized as severely as 100 times that amount of the other cocaine-related elements enumerated in the statute.  These provisions were still in effect at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Sentencing Commission subsequently promulgated Sentencing Guidelines for drug-trafficking offenses.  Under the Guidelines, the offense levels for drug crimes are tied to the drug type and quantity involved.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2010) (USSG).  The Commission originally adopted the ADAA\xe2\x80\x99s 100-to-1 ratio for offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d though instead of setting only two quantity thresholds, as the ADAA did, the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cset sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commission Report 1; see generally <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U.

On its plain terms, then, \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine.  In arguing to the contrary, DePierre asks us to stray far from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, as the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine\xe2\x80\x9d appears nowhere in the ADAA (or the United States Code, for that matter).  While the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading is not without its problems,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] that reading follows from the words Congress chose to include in the text.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rodriquez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/377/index.html">553 U. S. 377</a>, 384 (2008) (eschewing an interpretation that was \xe2\x80\x9cnot faithful to the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d is more plausibly read to mean the \xe2\x80\x9cchemically basic form of cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 15, than it is \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 24, 28.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</font></font></font></p><font super="-1"><font super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with DePierre that using the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to C<font super="-1">17H<font super="-1">21NO<font super="-1">4 is technically redundant; as noted earlier, chemically speaking cocaine <em>is</em> a base.  If Congress meant in clause (iii) to penalize more severely offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance \xe2\x80\xa6 which contains\xe2\x80\x9d cocaine in its base form it could have simply (and more correctly) used the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d instead.  But Congress had good reason to use \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in the ADAA\xe2\x80\x94to distinguish the substances covered by clause (iii) from other cocaine-related substances.  For example, at the time Congress enacted the statute, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d was commonly used to refer to cocaine hydrochloride, <em>i.e.</em>, powder cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mon-toya de Hernandez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/index.html">473 U. S. 531</a>, 536, 544 (1985)\n(repeatedly referring to cocaine hydrochloride as \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d); \xe2\x80\x9cCrack\xe2\x80\x9d Cocaine, Hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 94 (1986) (hereinafter Crack Cocaine Hearing) (prepared statement of David L. Westrate, Assistant Administrator, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice) (discussing production of \xe2\x80\x9ca white, crystalline powder, cocaine hydrochloride, otherwise known simply as cocaine\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></font></font></p><font super="-1"><font super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To make things more confusing, in the scientific and medical literature the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d is often used to refer to <em>all</em> cocaine-related substances, including powder cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Fay, The Alcohol/Drug Abuse Dictionary and Encyclopedia 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (1988); Weiss et\xc2\xa0al., Cocaine, at 15\xe2\x80\x9325; R. Lewis, Hawley\xe2\x80\x99s Condensed Chemical Dictionary 317 (15th ed. 2007).  Accordingly, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice to use the admittedly redundant term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to chemically basic cocaine is best understood as an effort to make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to offenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic \ncocaine-related substances.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary, reading \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to mean chemically basic cocaine is also consistent with \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat confounding structure.  DePierre is correct that the interpretation we adopt today raises the question why Congress included the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in subclause (II) of clause (ii).  That subclause lists \xe2\x80\x9c<em>cocaine</em>, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers\xe2\x80\x9d as elements subject to clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s higher quantity threshold.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II), (B)(ii)(II) (emphasis added).  If, as we conclude, the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d both mean chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving a mixture or substance which contains such cocaine will always be penalized according to the lower quantity thresholds of clause (iii), and never the higher quantity thresholds clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances containing \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this much is true, we do not agree with DePierre that the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in subclause (II) is therefore superfluous.  For without the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d subclause (II) makes no sense: It would provide a minimum sentence for offenses involving a specified quantity of simply \xe2\x80\x9cits salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\xe2\x80\x9d  In light of the structure of the subclause, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d is needed as the reference point for \xe2\x80\x9csalts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cisomers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The word \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in subclause (II) also performs another critical function.  Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance <em>described in clause (ii)</em> which contains cocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii) (emphasis added).  In other words, clause (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for\na subset of those substances\xe2\x80\x94the ones that \xe2\x80\x9ccontai[n] cocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  For this structure to work, however, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1) must \xe2\x80\x9cdescrib[e] in clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x9d substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the subset described in clause (iii).  If such substances were not present in clause (ii), clause (iii) would only apply to substances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and one of the <em>other</em> elements enumerated in clause (ii).  Presumably, the result would be that clause (iii) would not apply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca paste offenses, as there is no indication that, in addition to \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, C<font super="-1">17H<font super="-1">21NO<font super="-1">4), those substances contain cocaine \xe2\x80\x9csalts\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>e.g.</em>, cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of the other elements enumerated in clause (ii).  In short, the exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d from clause (ii) would result in clause (iii) effectively describing a null set, which obviously was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.</font></font></font></p><font super="-1"><font super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, this redundancy could have been avoided by simply drafting clause (iii) to penalize offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9ca mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d without reference to clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x94that is, Congress could have drafted clause (iii) to specify a <em>separate</em> set of cocaine-related substances, not a <em>subset</em> of those in clause (ii).  That we may rue inartful legislative drafting, however, does not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a statute as faithfully as possible to its actual text.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  And as noted earlier, there is no textual support for DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also recognize that our reading of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d in subclause (II) and \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (iii) to both refer to chemically basic cocaine is in tension with the usual rule that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sosa</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/692/index.html">542 U. S. 692</a>, 711, n.\xc2\xa09 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  However, because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress sometimes uses slightly different language to convey the same message,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Deal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/129/index.html">508 U. S. 129</a>, 134 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), we must be careful not to place too much emphasis on the marginal semantic divergence between the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have already explained, Congress had good reason to employ the latter term in clause (iii), and the slight inconsistency in nomenclature is insufficient reason to adopt DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Cf. <em>Public Lands Council</em> v. <em>Babbitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/728/index.html">529 U.

As is evident from the pre-ceding discussion, this position is not supported by the statutory text.  To be sure, the records of the contemporaneous congressional hearings suggest that Congress was most concerned with the particular dangers posed by the advent of crack cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Crack Cocaine Hearing 1 (statement of Chairman Roth) (\xe2\x80\x9c[We] mee[t] today to examine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the drug abuse problem\xe2\x80\x94the growing availability and use of a cheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known on the streets as \xe2\x80\x98crack\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see generally Commission Report 116\xe2\x80\x93118; <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U.

Numerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the primary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was\nbecause\xe2\x80\x94contrary to powder cocaine\xe2\x80\x94cocaine in its base form is smoked, which was understood to produce a faster, more intense, and more addictive high than powder cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Crack Cocaine Hearing 20 (statement of Dr. Robert Byck, Yale University School of Medicine) (stating that the ability to inhale vapor \xe2\x80\x9cis the reason why crack, or cocaine free-base, is so dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is not, however, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase and coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous, smokeable forms of cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 70 (prepared statement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from snorting powder cocaine to \xe2\x80\x9cnewer more dangerous routes of administration, such as freebase smoking\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (statement of Dr. Byck) (describing the damaging effects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the testimony of witnesses before Congress did not clearly distinguish between these base forms of cocaine; witnesses repeatedly used terms like \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfreebase,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine freebase\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner that grouped crack cocaine with other substances containing chemically basic forms of cocaine.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Trafficking and Abuse of \xe2\x80\x9cCrack\xe2\x80\x9d in New York City, House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M. Stutman, Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ocaine in its alkaloid form [is] commonly known on the street as crack, rock, base, or freebase\xe2\x80\x9d); Crack Cocaine Hearing 71 (statement of Dr. Schuster) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, \xe2\x80\x98crack\xe2\x80\x99 is a street name for cocaine freebase\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, prior to passage of the ADAA, multiple bills were introduced in Congress that imposed enhanced penalties on those who trafficked in \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.,</em> S. 2787, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa71 (1986), as well as \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine freebase,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. 5394, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7101 (1986); H.\xc2\xa0R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7608(a) (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given crack cocaine\xe2\x80\x99s sudden emergence and the similarities it shared with other forms of cocaine, this lack of clarity is understandable, as is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to adopt a statutory term that would encompass all forms.  Congress faced what it perceived to be a new threat of massive scope.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Crack Cocaine Hearing 4 (statement of Sen. Nunn) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ocaine use, particularly in the more pure form known as crack, is at near epidemic proportions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 21 (statement of Dr. Byck) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are dealing with\na worse drug \xe2\x80\xa6 than we have ever dealt with, or that anybody has ever dealt with in history\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, Con-gress chose statutory language broad enough to meet\nthat threat.  As we have noted, \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79 (1998).  In the absence of any indication in the statutory text that Congress intended only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penalties, we cannot adopt DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s narrow construction.  See <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that it covers only what we think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress really intended\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DePierre also argues that we should read the term \xe2\x80\x9cco-caine base\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than chemically basic cocaine, because the latter definition leads to an absurd result.  Cf. <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Commercial Office Products Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/107/index.html">486 U. S. 107</a>, 120 (1988) (plurality opinion).  He contends that, because coca leaves themselves contain cocaine, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach an offense involving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the 5-year minimum sentence in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though those leaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable cocaine.  See Brief for Petitioner 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  While we agree that it would be questionable to treat 5 grams of coca leaves as equivalent to 500 grams of powder cocaine for minimum-sentence purposes, we are not persuaded that such a result would actually obtain in light of our decision today.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, it is a matter of dispute between the parties whether coca leaves in their natural, unprocessed form actually contain chemically basic cocaine.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 15, 17, n.\xc2\xa010, with Brief for United States 43.  Even assuming that DePierre is correct as a matter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its base form,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] see Physicians Brief 2, 11, the Government has averred that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould not be able to make that showing in court,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and that \xe2\x80\x9ccoca leaves should not be treated as containing \xe2\x80\x98cocaine base\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of Clause (iii),\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 45.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is unsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its brief disclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which\nit had sought, or the defendant had received, a statutory-minimum sentence enhanced under clause (iii) for an of-fense involving coca leaves.  <em>Id.</em>, at 44.  And although\nthis question is not before us today, we note that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate choice to enumerate \xe2\x80\x9ccoca leaves\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii) strongly indicates its intent that offenses involving such leaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds of that clause.  Accordingly, there is little danger that the statute will be read in the \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd\xe2\x80\x9d manner DePierre fears.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, DePierre suggests that because the Sentencing Commission has, since 1993, defined \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with respect to \xc2\xa7841(b)(1).  We do not agree.  We have never held that, when interpreting a term in a criminal statute, deference is warranted to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the same term in the Guidelines.  Cf. <em>Neal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/284/index.html">516 U. S. 284</a>, 290\xe2\x80\x93296 (1996).  And we need not decide now whether such deference would be appropriate, because the Guidelines do not purport to interpret \xc2\xa7841(b)(1).  See USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c), n. (D) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Cocaine base,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>for the purposes of this guideline</em>, means \xe2\x80\x98crack\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that, because the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (iii) differs from the Guidelines definition, certain sentencing anomalies may result.  For example, an offense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine and one involving 5 grams of coca paste both trigger a minimum 5-\nyear sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B)(iii).  But defendants convicted of offenses involving only 4 grams of each substance\xe2\x80\x94which do not trigger the statutory minimums\xe2\x80\x94would likely receive different sentences, because of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 differential treatment of those substances with respect to offense level.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Compare USSG \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(9) (providing an offense level of 22 for at least 4 grams of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d) with \xc2\xa72D1.1(c)(14) (providing an offense level of 12 for less than 25 grams of \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d which, under the Guidelines, includes coca paste).  As we have noted in previous opinions, however, such disparities are the inevitable result of the dissimilar operation of the fixed minimum sentences Congress has provided by stat-\n</p>\n<p>\n\nute and the graduated sentencing scheme established\nby the Guidelines.  See <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U. S., at 107\xe2\x80\x93108; <em>Neal</em>, 516 U. S., at 291\xe2\x80\x93292.  Accordingly, we reject De-Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d as used in clause (iii) must be given the same definition as it has under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, DePierre argues that, because \xc2\xa7841(b)(1) is at the very least ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to interpret the statute in his favor.

S. 507</a>, 514 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them\xe2\x80\x9d).  As evinced by the preceding discussion, we cannot say that the statute is crystalline.  The rule, however, is reserved for cases where, \xe2\x80\x9cafter seizing everything from which aid can be derived, the Court is left with an ambiguous statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 239 (1993) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Applying the normal rules of statutory construction in this case, it is clear that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses involving \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d but those involving substances containing chemically basic cocaine more generally.  There is no per-suasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.  Because the statutory text allows us to make far more than \xe2\x80\x9ca guess as to what Congress intended,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Koray</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/50/index.html">515 U.

Our holding today\nis that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9ccocaine base\xe2\x80\x9d refers to cocaine base, rather than, as DePierre contends, one particular type of cocaine base.  This holding is in my view obvious, and the Court does not disagree.  It begins its discussion of the legislative history by saying that DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s position \xe2\x80\x9cis not supported by the statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13; and ends the discussion by saying that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the absence of any indication in the statutory text that Congress intended only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penalties, we cannot adopt DePierre\xe2\x80\x99s narrow construction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Everything in-between could and should have been omitted.

And here, as always, the needless detour into legislative history is not harmless.
