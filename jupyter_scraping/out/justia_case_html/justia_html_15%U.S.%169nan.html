Condemnation to the captors.</p>\n<p>From the papers found on board these vessels and the preparatory examinations in the court below, it appeared that they were foreign vessels, having on board, as was admitted on all sides, false and simulated Swedish papers.  They both sailed from Halifax, N.S., about 24 November, 1813, laden with cargoes of British manufactured goods destined for the United States, and on the same day were captured near the Ragged Islands, either really or collusively, by the privateer <em>Washington,</em> of 243,095 tons, one gun and fifteen men, belonging to Portland </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 15 U. S. 170</a></p><p> in the District of Maine, and commanded by William Malcomb.  They were taken in sight of each other, the <em>Jahnstoff</em> first, within about three hours, and the <em>Bothnea,</em> within about nine hours after leaving Halifax.  At the time of the capture, there were on board the <em>Bothnea</em> seven persons, and on board of the <em>Jahnstoff</em> five persons, composing their respective crews, and one American passenger.  The whole of the crews were taken from each vessel and landed in a boat at Ragged Islands.  The American passengers were retained on board, and under the superintendence of prize masters and crews.  The <em>Bothnea</em> was conducted into Salem, and the <em>Jahnstoff</em> into Plymouth, in the District of Massachusetts.  Immediately on their arrival they were seized by the collectors of those ports for an alleged violation of the nonimportation act.  Prize proceedings were also commenced by the captors against both vessels before the District Court of Massachusetts.  The American passengers were examined on the standing interrogatories, and the papers found on board deposited in court by the prize masters.  The papers found on board the <em>Bothnea</em> were the Swedish simulated papers.  Two bills of lading of the cargo, dated 23 November, 1813, purporting that the whole cargo was shipped by John Moody &amp; Company, merchants, of Halifax, for New London, consigned to order.  A clearance from Halifax, dated on the same day.  A British license from Sir John Sherbrooke, governor, &amp;c., dated on 9 November, 1813, authorizing John Moody and others to export in any vessel not belonging to France to any port in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 15 U. S. 171</a></p><p> United States, any British goods, on British or American account, which license was to continue in force for two months.  And two letters dated at Halifax on 23 November, 1813, one purporting to be addressed to the consignee of the cargo, the other to be addressed to the master of the <em>Bothnea.</em>  These letters are as follows:</p>\n<p>"Halifax, November 23, 1813"</p>\n<p>"Dear Sir:  We now only enclose you a bill of lading of the cargo shipped on our joint account per the <em>Bothnea,</em> agreeable to the memorandum left with us by Vandervel when last here.

That court dismissed the captor\'s libel and condemned the vessels and their cargoes to the United States, from which sentence an appeal was interposed to the circuit court, which court affirmed the condemnation, and the causes were brought to this court by appeal.  Further proof was ordered at the last term, and the causes again came on for hearing at the present term upon the further proof exhibited by both parties, and directed to explain the several points indicated by the court as grounds of doubt on the original evidence.  Under the commissions taken out to examine witnesses, the following interrogatories were exhibited on the part of the captors.</p>\n<p>"Have not some of the privateers, fitted out in the eastern ports, during the war of the revolution and the late war, been of very small burthen?"</p>\n<p>"Was it not usual for these privateers, armed sometimes with one carriage gun only, to proceed coastwise upon short cruises, and did they not capture prizes of great value?"</p>\n<p>"Was it not their practice to frequent the ports of the District of Maine and of the Province of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 15 U.

But, among other circumstances, it was proved that nine out of fifteen of the prize crew were joint owners.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE JOHNSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>After duly weighing the evidence in these cases, a majority of the Court is of opinion that the vessel and cargo must be adjudged to the owners, officers, and crew of the capturing privateer.  Independently of the act of landing the entire crews of the captured vessels, there was nothing in the case which necessarily led to suspicion.  And this is explained on a ground that is very plausible, to-wit, that having a course to run which swarmed with enemy\'s vessels, their intention was to personate the original crew and pass off the prizes on the approach of an enemy under their original character.  It is not at all impossible that nothing but this <em>ruse de guerre</em> may have been in contemplation of the crew.  There is indeed something in it peculiarly characteristic, when we consider the spirit of adventure and great mental resources which distinguish the people of whom the crew was composed.  It is to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 15 U. S. 177</a></p><p> be regretted that this talent for enterprise had not been always more happily applied than it was in the adventure of the <em>Jahnstoff</em> and <em>Bothnea.</em>  These vessels had both been employed in transporting provisions from New Haven to Halifax, and were now returning with cargoes of dry goods to be smuggled into the United States in the vicinity of the same place.  The documentary evidence shows an intimate correspondence between the shippers at Halifax and some persons resident in the United States.  But who they were must remain unknown, as the merchants in Halifax have, in their examination, refused to betray them.  That the voyages of these vessels was loaded with infamy no one pretends to deny.  The reasoning of the courts below is unanswerable on this point.  But the majority of this Court is of opinion that the evidence is not sufficient to fasten on the captors a participation in the fraud.  The whole may have been, for aught we know, a combination of machinery, the result of the most consummate art.  It is certainly true that in one view of the case, everything may be attributed to artifice, in another to natural conduct.  Scarcely a feature of it may not be indifferently pronounced the lineament of guilt or innocence.  In such a case, a court of justice has no alternative.  It must pronounce in favor of innocence.</p>\n<p>The decrees below will therefore be reversed, and the vessels and cargoes adjudged to the captors.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STORY gave no opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
