S. 508</a></p><p> issued in registered form. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This original jurisdiction case presents the issues whether \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) of TEFRA either (1) violates the Tenth Amendment and constitutional principles of federalism by compelling States to issue bonds in registered form or (2) violates the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity by taxing the interest earned on unregistered state bonds.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Historically, bonds have been issued as either registered bonds or bearer bonds.  These two types of bonds differ in the mechanisms used for transferring ownership and making payments.  Ownership of a registered bond is recorded on a central list, and a transfer of record ownership requires entering the change on that list. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The record owner automatically receives interest payments by check or electronic transfer of funds from the issuer\'s paying agent.  Ownership of a bearer bond, in contrast, is presumed from possession and is transferred by physically handing over the bond.  The bondowner obtains interest payments by presenting bond coupons to a bank that in turn presents the coupons to the issuer\'s paying agent.</p>\n<p>In 1982, Congress enacted TEFRA, which contains a variety of provisions, including \xc2\xa7 310, designed to reduce the federal deficit by promoting compliance with the tax laws.  Congress had become concerned about the growing magnitude of tax evasion; Internal Revenue Service (IRS) studies indicated that unreported income had grown from an estimated range of $31.1 billion to $32.2 billion in 1973 to a range of $93.3 billion to $97 billion in 1981.  Compliance Gap:  Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Internal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 485 U. S. 509</a></p><p> Revenue Service of the Senate Committee on Finance, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 126 (1982).  Unregistered bonds apparently became a focus of attention because they left no paper trail, and thus facilitated tax evasion.  Then Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy John Chapoton testified before the House Ways and Means Committee that a registration requirement would help prevent tax evasion because bearer bonds often represent unreported and untaxed income that, without a system of recorded ownership, the IRS has difficulty reconstructing.  Hearings on H.R. 6300 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1982).  He also expressed concern that bearer bonds were being used to avoid estate and gift taxes and as a medium of exchange in the illegal sector.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In reporting out the bill containing the provision that eventually became \xc2\xa7 310 of TEFRA, the Senate Finance Committee Report expressed the same concerns:</p>\n<p>"The committee believes that a fair and efficient system of information reporting and withholding cannot be achieved with respect to interest-bearing obligations as long as a significant volume of long-term bearer instruments is issued.  A system of book-entry registration will preserve the liquidity of obligations while requiring the creation of ownership records that can produce useful information reports with respect to both the payment of interest and the sale of obligations prior to maturity through brokers.  Furthermore, registration will reduce the ability of noncompliant taxpayers to conceal income and property from the reach of the income, estate, and gift taxes.  Finally, the registration requirement may reduce the volume of readily negotiable substitutes for cash available to persons engaged in illegal activities."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 97-494, Vol. 1, p. 242 (1982).  Section 310 was designed to meet these concerns by providing powerful incentives to issue bonds in registered form. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 485 U. S. 510</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because \xc2\xa7 310 aims to address the tax evasion concerns posed generally by unregistered bonds, it covers not only state bonds but also bonds issued by the United States and private corporations.  Section 310(a) requires the United States to issue publicly offered bonds with a maturity of more than one year in registered form. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  With respect to similar bonds issued by private corporations, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 310(b)(2) (6) impose a series of tax penalties on nonregistration.  Corporations declining to issue the covered bonds in registered form lose tax deductions and adjustments for interest paid on the bonds, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 310(b)(2) and (3), and must pay a special excise tax on the bond principal, \xc2\xa7 310(b)(4).  Holders of these unregistered corporate bonds generally cannot deduct capital losses or claim capital gain treatment for any losses or gains sustained on the bonds.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 310(b)(5) and (6).  Section 310 (b)(1) completes this statutory scheme by denying the federal income tax exemption for interest earned on state bonds to owners of long-term publicly offered state bonds that are not issued in registered form.</p>\n<p>South Carolina invoked the original jurisdiction of this Court, contending that \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) is constitutionally invalid under the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.  We granted South Carolina leave to file the instant complaint against the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, <em>South Carolina v. Regan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/367/case.html">465 U. S. 367</a></span> (1984), and appointed as Special Master the Honorable Samuel J. Roberts, 466 U.S. 948 (1984).  The National Governors\' Association (NGA) intervened. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  After conducting hearings and taking evidence, the Special Master concluded that \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) was constitutional and recommended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 485 U. S. 511</a></p><p> entering judgment for the defendant.  South Carolina and the NGA filed exceptions to various factual findings of the Special Master and to the Master\'s legal conclusions concerning their constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We address the claim that \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) violates the Tenth Amendment first. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  South Carolina and the NGA contend, and the Master found, that \xc2\xa7 310 effectively requires States to issue bonds in registered form, noting that if States issued bonds in unregistered form, competition from other nonexempt bonds would force States to increase the interest paid on state bonds by 28-35%, and that, even though almost all state bonds were issued in bearer form before \xc2\xa7 310 became effective, since then, no State has issued a bearer bond.  Report of Special Master 2, 23-24.  South Carolina and the NGA thus argue that, for purposes of Tenth Amendment analysis, we must treat \xc2\xa7 310 as if it simply banned bearer bonds altogether, without giving States the option to issue nonexempt bearer bonds.  The Secretary does not dispute the finding that \xc2\xa7 310 effectively requires registration, <em>see</em> Brief for Defendant 19 (urging the Court to adopt all the Master\'s findings), preferring to argue that \xc2\xa7 310 survives Tenth Amendment scrutiny because a blanket prohibition by Congress on the issuance of bearer bonds can apply to States without violating the Tenth Amendment.  For the purposes of Tenth Amendment analysis, then, we treat \xc2\xa7 310 as if it directly regulated States by prohibiting outright the issuance of bearer bonds. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 485 U. S. 512</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Tenth Amendment limits on Congress\' authority to regulate state activities are set out in <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/case.html">469 U. S. 528</a></span> (1985).  <em>Garcia</em> holds that the limits are structural, not substantive -- <em>i.e.,</em> that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/case.html#537">469 U. S. 537</a></span>-554.  South Carolina contends that the political process failed here, because Congress had no concrete evidence quantifying the tax evasion attributable to unregistered state bonds, and relied instead on anecdotal evidence that taxpayers have concealed taxable income using bearer bonds.  It also argues that Congress chose an ineffective remedy by requiring registration, because most bond sales are handled by brokers who must file information reports regardless of the form of the bond, and because beneficial ownership of registered bonds need not necessarily be recorded.</p>\n<p>Although <em>Garcia</em> left open the possibility that some extraordinary defects in the national political process might render congressional regulation of state activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment, the Court in <em>Garcia</em> had no occasion to identify or define the defects that might lead to such invalidation.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/case.html#556">469 U. S. 556</a></span>.  Nor do we attempt any definitive articulation here.  It suffices to observe that South </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 485 U. S. 513</a></p><p> Carolina has not even alleged that it was deprived of any right to participate in the national political process or that it was singled out in a way that left it politically isolated and powerless.  <em>Cf. United States v. Carolene Products Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/144/case.html">304 U. S. 144</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/144/case.html#152">304 U. S. 152</a></span>, n. 4 (1938).  Rather, South Carolina argues that the political process failed here because \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) was "imposed by the vote of an uninformed Congress relying upon incomplete information."  Brief for Plaintiff 101. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But nothing in <em>Garcia</em> or the Tenth Amendment authorizes courts to second-guess the substantive basis for congressional legislation.  <em>Cf.

Where, as here, the national political process did not operate in a defective manner, the Tenth Amendment is not implicated.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The NGA argues that \xc2\xa7 310 is invalid because it commandeers the state legislative and administrative process by coercing States into enacting legislation authorizing bond registration and into administering the registration scheme.  They cite <em>FERC v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html">456 U. S. 742</a></span> (1982), which left open the possibility that the Tenth Amendment might set some limits on Congress\' power to compel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#761">456 U. S. 761</a></span>-764.  The extent to which the Tenth Amendment claim left open in <em>FERC</em> survives <em>Garcia</em> or poses constitutional limitations independent of those discussed in <em>Garcia</em> is far from clear.  We need not, however, address that issue because we find the claim discussed in <em>FERC</em> inapplicable to \xc2\xa7 310. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 485 U. S. 514</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The federal statute at issue in <em>FERC</em> required state utility commissions to do the following:  (1) adjudicate and enforce federal standards, (2) either consider adopting certain federal standards or cease regulating public utilities, and (3) follow certain procedures.  The Court in <em>FERC</em> first distinguished <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976), noting that the statute in <em>National League of Cities</em> presented questions concerning "the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations," whereas the statute in <em>FERC</em> "attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals."  <em>FERC,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#759">456 U. S. 759</a></span>.  The Court in <em>FERC</em> then concluded that, whatever constitutional limitations might exist on the federal power to compel state regulatory activity, Congress had the power to require that state adjudicative bodies adjudicate federal issues and to require that States regulating in a preemptable field consider suggested federal standards and follow federally mandated procedures.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#759">456 U. S. 759</a></span>-767.</p>\n<p>Because, by hypothesis, \xc2\xa7 310 effectively prohibits issuing unregistered bonds, it presents the very situation <em>FERC</em> distinguished from a commandeering of state regulatory machinery:  the extent to which the Tenth Amendment "shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations."  456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#759">456 U. S. 759</a></span>.  Section 310 regulates state activities; it does not, as did the statute in <em>FERC,</em> seek to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.  The NGA nonetheless contends that \xc2\xa7 310 has commandeered the state legislative and administrative process because many state legislatures had to amend a substantial number of statutes in order to issue bonds in registered form and because state officials had to devote substantial effort to determine how best to implement a registered bond system.  Such "commandeering" is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity.  Any federal regulation demands compliance.  That a State wishing to engage in certain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 485 U. S. 515</a></p><p> activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.  After <em>Garcia,</em> for example, several States and municipalities had to take administrative and legislative action to alter the employment practices or raise the funds necessary to comply with the wage and overtime provisions of the Federal Labor Standards Act. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Indeed, even the pre-<em>Garcia</em> line of Tenth Amendment cases recognized that Congress could constitutionally impose federal requirements on States that States could meet only by amending their statutes.  <em>See EEOC v. Wyoming,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/226/case.html">460 U. S. 226</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/226/case.html#253">460 U. S. 253</a></span>-254, and n. 2 (1983) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (citing state statutes from over half the States that did not comply with the federal statute upheld by the Court).  Under the NGA\'s theory, moreover, any State could immunize its activities from federal regulation by simply codifying the manner in which it engages in those activities.  In short, the NGA\'s theory of "commandeering" would not only render <em>Garcia</em> a nullity, but would also restrict congressional regulation of state activities even more tightly than it was restricted under the now overruled <em>National League of Cities</em> line of cases.  We find the theory foreclosed by precedent, and uphold the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 310 under the Tenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>South Carolina contends that, even if a statute banning state bearer bonds entirely would be constitutional, \xc2\xa7 310 unconstitutionally violates the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity because it imposes a tax on the interest earned on a state bond.  We agree with South Carolina that \xc2\xa7 310 is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 485 U. S. 516</a></p><p> inconsistent with <em>Pollock v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html">157 U. S. 429</a></span> (1895), which held that any interest earned on a state bond was immune from federal taxation.</p>\n<p>The Secretary and the Master, however, suggest that we should uphold the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 310 without explicitly overruling <em>Pollock</em> because \xc2\xa7 310 does not abolish the tax exemption for state bond interest entirely, but rather taxes the interest on state bonds only if the bonds are not issued in the form Congress requires.  In our view, however, this suggestion implicitly rests on a rather mischievous proposition of law.  If, for example, Congress imposed a tax that applied exclusively to South Carolina and levied the tax directly on the South Carolina treasury, we would be obligated to adjudicate the constitutionality of that tax even if Congress allowed South Carolina to escape the tax by restructuring its state government in a way Congress found more to its liking.  The United States cannot convert an unconstitutional tax into a constitutional one simply by making the tax conditional.  Whether Congress could have imposed the condition by direct regulation is irrelevant; Congress cannot employ unconstitutional means to reach a constitutional end.  Under <em>Pollock,</em> a tax on the interest income derived from any state bond was considered a direct tax on the State, and thus unconstitutional.  157 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html#585">157 U. S. 585</a></span>-586.  If this constitutional rule still applies, Congress cannot threaten to tax the interest on state bonds that do not conform to congressional dictates.  We thus decline to follow a suggestion that would force us to embrace implicitly a proposition of law far more controversial than the current validity of <em>Pollock\'s</em> ban on taxing state bond interest, and proceed to address whether <em>Pollock</em> should be explicitly overruled.

The Court in <em>Pollock</em> borrowed its reasoning directly from the decision in <em>Weston</em> exempting federal bond interest from state taxation:</p>\n<p>"\'The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract.  The extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government.  To any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burthen on the operations of government. . . .  The tax on government stock is thought by this court to be a tax on the contract, a tax on the [government\'s] power to borrow money . . . and consequently to be repugnant to the Constitution.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Pollock, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html#586">157 U.

Thus, although a tax was collected from an independent private party, the tax was considered to be "on" the government because the tax burden might be passed on to it through the contract.  This reasoning was used to define the basic scope of both federal and state tax immunities with respect to all types of government contracts.

In that case, the Court reviewed the then-current status of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, observing that a tax on interest earned on a state or federal bond was unconstitutional because it would burden the exercise of the government\'s power to borrow money, and that a tax on the salary of a State or Federal Government employee was unconstitutional because it would burden the government\'s power to obtain the employee\'s services.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/570/case.html#576">283 U.

The immunities have also differed somewhat in their underlying political theory and in their doctrinal contours.  Many of this Court\'s opinions have suggested that the Constitution should be interpreted to confer a greater tax immunity on the Federal Government than on States, because all the people of the States are represented in the Federal Government, whereas all the people of the Federal Government are not represented in individual States.  <em>Helvering v.

In fact, the federal tax immunity has always been greater than the States\' immunity.  The Federal Government, for example, possesses the power to enact statutes immunizing those with whom it deals from state taxation even if intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine would not otherwise confer an immunity.  <em>See, e.g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O\'Keefe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/case.html">306 U.

Also, although the Federal Government has always enjoyed blanket immunity from any state tax considered to be "on" the Government under the prevailing methodology, the States have never enjoyed immunity from all federal taxes considered to be "on" a State.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/505/case.html#523">485 U.

We need not, however, decide here the extent to which the scope of the federal and state immunities differ or the extent, if any, to which States are currently immune from direct nondiscriminatory federal taxation.  It is enough for our purposes that federal and state tax immunity cases have always shared the identical methodology for determining whether a tax is "on" a government, and that this identity has persisted even though the methodology for both federal and state immunities has changed as intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine shifted into the modern era.  <em>See Graves, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/case.html#485">306 U.

We disagree.  The legislative history merely shows that the words "from whatever source derived" of the Sixteenth Amendment were not affirmatively intended to authorize Congress to tax state bond interest or to have any other effect on which incomes were subject to federal taxation, and that the sole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to remove the apportionment requirement for whichever incomes were otherwise taxable.  45 Cong.Rec. 2245-2246 (1910); <em>id.</em> at 2539; <em>see also Brushaber v.

The nondiscrimination principle at the heart of modern intergovernmental tax immunity case law does not leave States unprotected from excessive federal taxation -- it merely recognizes that the best safeguard against excessive taxation (and the most judicially manageable) is the requirement that the government tax in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  For where a government imposes a nondiscriminatory tax, judges can term the tax "excessive" only by second-guessing the extent to which the taxing government and its people have taxed themselves, and the threat of destroying another government can be realized only if the taxing government is willing to impose taxes that will also destroy itself or its constituents.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Because we hold that Congress could have prohibited States from issuing any unregistered bonds by direct regulation, we necessarily reject South Carolina\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) is an impermissible regulatory tax because it imposes a tax on activities not subject to federal regulatory power.

Second, the majority concludes that the statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 485 U.

Most notably, the Special Master found that the registration requirements have had no substantive effect on the abilities of States to raise debt capital, on the political processes by which States decide to issue debt, or on the power of the States to choose the purpose to which they will dedicate the proceeds of their tax-exempt borrowing.

Those issues, intriguing as they may be, are of no moment in the present case, and are best left unaddressed until clearly presented.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today overrules a precedent that it has honored for nearly 100 years and expresses a willingness to cancel the constitutional immunity that traditionally has shielded the interest paid on state and local bonds from federal taxation.  Henceforth the ability of state and local governments to finance their activities will depend in part on whether Congress voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of additional income tax revenue.  I believe that state autonomy is an important factor to be considered in reviewing the National Government\'s exercise of its enumerated powers.  <em>Garcia v.

The Court readily concludes that Congress could have prohibited outright the issuance of bearer bonds without violating the Tenth Amendment.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/505/case.html#511">485 U.

But regardless of whether Congress could have required registration of the bonds directly under its commerce power, I agree with the Court that Congress may not accomplish the same end by an unconstitutional means.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/505/case.html#515">485 U.

S. 531</a></p><p> In my view, the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution prohibit Congress from taxing or threatening to tax the interest paid on state and municipal bonds.  It is also arguable that the States\' autonomy is protected from substantial federal incursions by virtue of the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution, Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 4.  <em>See</em> Merritt, The Guarantee Clause and State Autonomy:  Federalism for a Third Century, 88 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 70-78 (1988) (arguing that judicial enforcement of the Guarantee Clause is proper).</p>\n<p>The Court never expressly considers whether federal taxation of state and local bond interest violates the Constitution.  Instead, the majority characterizes the federal tax exemption for state and local bond interest as an aspect of intergovernmental tax immunity, and it describes the decline of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine in this century.  But constitutional principles do not depend upon the rise or fall of particular legal doctrines.  This Court has a continuing responsibility "to oversee the Federal Government\'s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States."  <em>Garcia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/case.html#581">469 U. S. 581</a></span> (O\'CONNOR, J., joined by Powell and REHNQUIST, JJ., dissenting).  In my view, the Court shirks its responsibility because it fails to inquire into the substantial adverse effects on state and local governments that would follow from federal taxation of the interest on state and local bonds.</p>\n<p>Long-term debt obligations are an essential source of funding for state and local governments.  In 1974, state and local governments issued approximately $23 billion of new municipal bonds; in 1984, they issued $102 billion of new bonds.  Report of Special Master 20.  State and local governments rely heavily on borrowed funds to finance education, road construction, and utilities, among other purposes.  As the Court recognizes, States will have to increase the interest rates they pay on bonds by 28-35% if the interest is subject to the federal income tax.  <em>Ante</em> at 511.  Governmental operations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 485 U. S. 532</a></p><p> will be hindered severely if the cost of capital rises by one-third.  If Congress may tax the interest paid on state and local bonds, it may strike at the very heart of state and local government activities.</p>\n<p>In the pivotal cases which first set limits to intergovernmental tax immunity, this Court paid close attention to the practical effects of its decisions.  The Court limited the government\'s immunity only after it determined that application of a tax would not substantially affect government operations.  Thus in the first case to uphold federal income taxation of revenue earned by a state contractor, this Court observed that "neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers."  <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/269/514/case.html">269 U. S. 514</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/269/514/case.html#523">269 U. S. 523</a></span>-524 (1926).  When this Court extended its holding to the case of a state tax on a federal contractor, it expressly noted that the tax "does not interfere in any substantial way with the performance of federal functions."  <em>James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/134/case.html">302 U.

In upholding the application of the federal income tax to income derived from a state lease, this Court decided that mere theoretical concerns about interference with the functions of government did not justify immunity, but that "[r]egard must be had to substance and direct effects."  <em>Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/376/case.html">303 U.

Gerhardt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/405/case.html">304 U. S. 405</a></span> (1938), this Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to income earned by a state employee, because there is</p>\n<p>"[no] immunity when the burden on the state is so speculative and uncertain that, if allowed, it would restrict the federal taxing power without affording any corresponding tangible protection to the state government."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/405/case.html#419">304 U. S. 419</a></span>-420.</p>\n<p>The instant case differs critically from the cases quoted above because the Special Master found that, if the interest on state and local bonds is taxed, the cost of borrowing by state and local governments would rise substantially.  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 485 U. S. 533</a></p><p> certainly would affect seriously state and local government operations.  The majority is unconcerned with this difference, because it is satisfied with the formal test of intergovernmental tax immunity that can be distilled from later cases.  Under this test, if a tax is not imposed directly on the government and does not discriminate against the government, then it does not violate intergovernmental tax immunity.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/505/case.html#523">485 U. S. 523</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I do not think the Court\'s bipartite test adequately accommodates the constitutional concerns raised by the prospect of applying the federal income tax to the interest paid on state and local bonds.  This Court has a duty to inquire into the devastating effects that such an innovation would have on state and local governments.  Although Congress has taken a relatively less burdensome step in subjecting only income from bearer bonds to federal taxation, the erosion of state sovereignty is likely to occur a step at a time.</p>\n<p>"If there is any danger, it lies in the tyranny of small decisions -- in the prospect that Congress will nibble away at state sovereignty, bit by bit, until someday essentially nothing is left but a gutted shell."</p>\n<p>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 381 (2d ed.1988).</p>\n<p>Federal taxation of state activities is inherently a threat to state sovereignty.  As Chief Justice Marshall observed long ago, "the power to tax involves the power to destroy."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#431">17 U. S. 431</a></span> (1819).  Justice Holmes later qualified this principle, observing that "[t]he power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits."  <em>Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/218/case.html">277 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/218/case.html#223">277 U. S. 223</a></span> (1928) (Holmes, J., joined by Brandeis and Stone, JJ., dissenting).  If this Court is the States\' sole protector against the threat of crushing taxation, it must take seriously its responsibility to sit in judgment of federal tax initiatives.  I do not think that the Court has lived up to its constitutional role in this case.  The Court has failed to enforce the constitutional safeguards of state autonomy and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 485 U. S. 534</a></p><p> self-sufficiency that may be found in the Tenth Amendment and the Guarantee Clause, as well as in the principles of federalism implicit in the Constitution.
