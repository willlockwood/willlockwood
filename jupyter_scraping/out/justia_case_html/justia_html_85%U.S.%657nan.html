JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The only point made in this case is that being one of equity jurisdiction, it was tried by jury as an action at law.  This being so, it would seem that under the Seventh Article of Amendments to the Constitution, it should have been removed by writ of error, and not by appeal.  But that aside, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 85 U. S. 659</a></p><p> we have just decided in <em>Hornbuckle v. Toombs</em> that equitable as well as legal relief may be pursued by the form of action prescribed by the territorial legislature.  There is no complaint that this was not done, or that substantial justice was not administered between the parties.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>Dissenting, JUSTICES CLIFFORD, DAVIS, and STRONG.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
