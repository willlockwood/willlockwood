Relying on Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/454/case.html">421 U.S. 454</a> (1975), in which this Court held that both legal and equitable relief is available in actions brought under 1981, and Curtis v. Loether, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/189/case.html">415 U.S. 189</a>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1066">Page 454 U.S. 1064 , 1066</a></p><p> 194, 1008 (1974), in which this Court held that "[t]he Seventh Amendment does apply to actions enforcing statutory rights, and requires a jury trial upon demand, if the statute creates legal rights and remedies enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law," the Court of Appeals concluded that respondent was entitled to a jury trial on all of his legal claims. It then held that "backpay or lost wage determinations are inherently in the nature of legal damages", 638 F.2d, at 1142, and, therefore, present an issue for the jury. The Court recognized that other courts had come to a different conclusion, but distinguished this case on one factual ground-respondent did not seek reinstatement-and rejected the argument that backpay is a form of "restitution." See Lynch v. Pan American World Airways, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/475/764/">475 F.2d 764</a> (CA5 1973); Robinson v.

In Moore v. Sun Oil Co. of Pennsylvania, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/636/154/">636 F.2d 154</a> (1980), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit confronted exactly the same factual situation as presented by this case. It reached a conclusion that directly conflicts with that reached by the Eighth Circuit: </p><p> "In the instant case, Moore is seeking \'back pay\' although he is not seeking the equitable relief of reinstatement by means of an injunction. However, \'back pay,\' under the law of this circuit, is equitable relief, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1067">Page 454 U.S. 1064 , 1067</a></p><p> therefore the parties are not entitled to a jury trial with respect to such issue even though reinstatement is not sought." Id., at 156. </p><p> Mr. Moore and Mr. Setser sought relief under the same federal statute and were entitled to the same judicial procedure for resolution of their claims. There should be no such a thing as "the law of this circuit" with respect to an issue as fundamental as the right to a jury trial. I would grant the petition and set the case for plenary consideration. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] In Moore the Court held:</p><ul>"Since Moore\'s claim for legal relief and equitable relief are both based on alleged racial discrimination and since Moore was entitled to a jury trial with respect to his legal claims, he was entitled to have a jury determine liability (i.e. whether he had been a victim of racial discrimination). 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Fed.Prac. &amp; Proc. 2306. If the jury so determined that here was liability, it would be for the court to determine whether Moore was entitled to back pay." 636 F.2d, at 157. </ul> <p> </p><p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Respondent also alleged that he was refused employment by petitioners in retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Petitioners seek review of the Court of Appeals holding that 1981 affords a cause of action for a claim based on alleged retaliation for such a filing. I do not believe that this issue merits consideration by the Court at this time. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc, limited to the question of the permissibility under 1981 of race-conscious affirmative- action plans designed to remedy racial imbalance in a private employer\'s work force. The conclusions of the court on this issue are not relevant to the issues presented in the petition for certiorari. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
