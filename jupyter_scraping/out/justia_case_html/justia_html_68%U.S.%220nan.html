JUSTICE SWAYNE, after stating the difference between the case and No. 80, and quoting this act, thus delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p>"In this act it is clearly implied that cities have authority to subscribe for railroad stock, and to issue their bonds in payment of it.  What is implied in a statute is as much a part of it as what is expressed.  (<em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/66/55/case.html#61">United States v. Babbitt,</a></span></em> 1 Black 61.)  Considering the subject in the light of these acts, we entertain no doubt that the city possessed the power to issue these bonds."</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and case remanded.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
