During his trial, Rippo received information that the judge was the target of a federal bribery probe, and he surmised that the Clark County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office\xe2\x80\x94which was prosecuting him\xe2\x80\x94was playing a role in that investigation.  Rippo moved for the judge\xe2\x80\x99s disqualification under the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, contending that a judge could not impartially adjudicate a case in which one of the parties was criminally investigating him.  But the trial judge declined to recuse himself, and (after that judge\xe2\x80\x99s indictment on federal charges) a different judge later denied Rippo\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a new trial.  The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal, reasoning in part that Rippo had not introduced evidence that state authorities were involved in the federal investigation.  <i>Rippo </i>v. <i>State</i>,<i> </i>113 Nev. 1239, 1246\xe2\x80\x931250, 946 P.\xc2\xa02d 1017, 1023\xe2\x80\x931024 (1997) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a later application for state postconviction relief, Rippo advanced his bias claim once more, this time pointing to documents from the judge\xe2\x80\x99s criminal trial indicating that the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office had participated in the investigation of the trial judge.  See, <i>e.g., </i>App. to Pet. for Cert. 236\xe2\x80\x93237, 397.  The state postconviction court denied relief, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.  <i>Rippo </i>v. <i>State</i>,<i> </i>132 Nev. ___, ___, 368 P.\xc2\xa03d 729, 743\xe2\x80\x93745 (2016).  It likened Rippo\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the \xe2\x80\x9ccamouflaging bias\xe2\x80\x9d theory that this Court discussed in <i>Bracy</i> v. <i>Gramley</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899 (1997)\n.  The <i>Bracy</i> petitioner argued that a judge who accepts bribes to rule in favor of some defendants would seek to disguise that favorable treatment by ruling <i>against</i> defendants who did not bribe him.  <i>Id.,</i> at 905.  We explained that despite the \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative\xe2\x80\x9d nature of that theory, the petitioner was entitled to discovery because he had also alleged specific facts suggesting that the judge may have colluded with defense counsel to rush the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case to trial.  See <i>id., </i>at 905\xe2\x80\x93909.  The Nevada Supreme Court reasoned that, in contrast, Rippo was not entitled to discovery or an evidentiary hearing because his allegations \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not support the assertion that the trial judge was actually biased in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  132 Nev., at ___, 368 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 744.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We vacate the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment because it applied the wrong legal standard.  Under our precedents, the Due Process Clause may sometimes demand recusal even when a judge \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98ha[s] no actual bias.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Lavoie</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813,\n825 (1986)\n.  Recusal is required when, objectively speaking, \xe2\x80\x9cthe probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Withrow</i> v. <i>Larkin</i>,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 35,\n47 (1975)\n; see <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court asks not whether a judge harbors an actual, subjective bias, but instead whether, as an objective matter, the average judge in his position is likely to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional potential for bias\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Our decision in <i>Bracy</i> is not to the contrary: Although we explained that the petitioner there <i>had </i>pointed to facts suggesting actual, subjective bias, we did not hold that a litigant must show as a matter of course that a judge was \xe2\x80\x9cactually biased in [the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s] case,\xe2\x80\x9d 132 Nev., at ___, 368 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 744\xe2\x80\x94much less that he must do so when, as here, he does not allege a theory of \xe2\x80\x9ccamouflaging bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Nevada Supreme Court did not ask the question our precedents require: whether, considering all the circumstances alleged, the risk of bias was too high to be constitutionally tolerable.  As a result, we grant the petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i>, and we<i> </i>vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The court further relied on its bias holding to determine that Rippo had not established cause and prejudice to overcome various state procedural bars.  132 Nev., at ___, 368 P. 3d, at 745.
