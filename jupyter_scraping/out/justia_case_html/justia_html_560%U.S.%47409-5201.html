When the difference between the time remaining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that final year proportional to the awards in other years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners claim that the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method is unlawful because \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the length of time that the prisoner actually serves.  The District Court rejected this challenge in each of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s cases, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method for calculating good time credit reflects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and purpose, taken together, support the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method.  That method tracks \xc2\xa73624(b)\xe2\x80\x99s language by providing a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of imprisonment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any additional time served that is less than a full year.  As \xc2\xa73624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of<em> </em>each year\xe2\x80\x9d of imprisonment.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 approach cannot be reconciled with the statute.  Because it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that he does not spend in prison.  Moreover the calculation of credit for such a year would <em>not </em>be made<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cat the end of\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>that year.  Nor could the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.<em>\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>This language did not find its way into the statute by accident.  The differences between the prior provision (repealed in 1984)\xe2\x80\x94which granted the prisoner a deduction at the outset of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules\xe2\x80\x94and the present statute\xe2\x80\x94under which \xe2\x80\x9ccredit\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cearned\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of\xe2\x80\x9d the year based on an evaluation of behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospective award.  The BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method also furthers the basic purpose of the statute.  Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater honesty by \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] all sentences basically determinate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 367.  Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide an incentive for prisoners to \xe2\x80\x9ccompl[y] with institutional disciplinary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose\xe2\x80\x94credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good behavior.  The BOP\xe2\x80\x99s approach furthers \xc2\xa73624\xe2\x80\x99s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior during the preceding year.  In contrast, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 approach would allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would loosen the statute\xe2\x80\x99s connection between good behavior and the good time award.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  Context indicates that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the portion of \xc2\xa73624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as petitioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on legislative history is misplaced.  A U. S. Sentencing Commission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular question whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence imposed.  Nor, in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, history, and purpose, is this a case in which there is a \xe2\x80\x9cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Muscarello </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/125/index.html">524 U. S. 125</a>, 139, permitting application of the rule of lenity.  Because the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s calculation system applies the statute as its language is most naturally read, and in accordance with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose, this Court need not determine the extent to which Congress has granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute more broadly, or differently than it has done here.  Cf. <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 844\xe2\x80\x93845.  And because the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s approach reflects the statute\xe2\x80\x99s most natural reading and is the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative interpretation.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73624(b).  Petitioners, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the Federal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this \xe2\x80\x9cgood time credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s method reflects the most natural reading of the statute, and we reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 legal challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A federal sentencing statute provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year \xe2\x80\xa6 may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73624(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a methodology that petitioners in this case challenge as unlawful.  In order to explain the BOP method, we shall use a simplified example that captures its essential elements.  The unsimplified calculations described by the BOP in its policy statement, see App. 96\xe2\x80\x93100, will reach approximately the same results as, and are essentially the mathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we describe (there may be other ways to describe the calculation as well).  To the extent that there are any differences between the methodology employed by the BOP and that reflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the resolution of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge and are therefore not before us.  Similarly, although petitioners committed their crimes before the current version of \xc2\xa73624 was enacted and are therefore subject to a previous version that differed slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73624 (1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are immaterial to the questions presented by this case.  The parties refer to the current version as the relevant provision of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2\xe2\x80\x933; Brief for Respondent 8, n.\xc2\xa02, and we shall do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has received a sentence of 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  We shall assume that his behavior throughout his confinement is exemplary and that prison authorities will consequently consider him to merit the maximum good time credit that the statute will allow.  And we shall ignore leap years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner would earn the statute\xe2\x80\x99s maximum credit of 54 days.  The relevant official (whom we shall call the \xe2\x80\x9cgood time calculator\xe2\x80\x9d) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily put the 54 days to the side.  At the end of Year 2 the prisoner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.  The good time calculator would add this 54 days to the first 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and again put the 108 days\xe2\x80\x99 credit to the side.  By the end of Year 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days of good time credit (8 years times 54 days).  At that time, the good time calculator would note that the difference between the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or 730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit (432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298 days, which is less than 365).  The 432 days of good time credit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8 are sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year prison term and to shorten the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s 9th year of imprisonment by 67 days.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s last year of imprisonment.  Further, because the prisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that year (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to Year 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner will have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.  Now the good time calculator will have to work out just how much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit against, these remaining 298 days.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we said, the statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9cgood time\xe2\x80\x9d for this \xe2\x80\x9clast year or portion\xe2\x80\x9d thereof shall be \xe2\x80\x9cprorated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two parts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in prison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will earn during the days served in Year 9.  In other words, the number of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of good time credit days earned will be equal to the number of days left in the sentence, namely, 298.  And to keep the award of credit in the last year proportional to awards in other years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (<em>i.e.</em>, the number of good time days divided by the number of days served) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP applies to full years served.  We can use some elementary algebra, described in the Appendix, <em>infra,</em> to work out the rest.  The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he can earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.  That is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence, the prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement, after which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for (given the additional 38 days\xe2\x80\x99 credit earned), and he will be released.  In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year (3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of days the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confinement and receive 470 days of \xe2\x80\x9cgood time\xe2\x80\x9d credit, about 15% of the prison time actually served.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case petitioners claim that the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method is unlawful.  They say that \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) (2006 ed.) requires a straightforward calculation based upon the length of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing judge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner actually serves.  Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a prison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, the statute permits a maximum good time award of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470 days that the method described above would allow.  And if the judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months, then the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10 years plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494 days that the method above would allow.  According to petitioners, the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method causes model prisoners to lose seven days of good time credit per year of imprisonment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one, Michael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months; the other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years and 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to several months of additional prison time.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court in each of these cases rejected the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge.  Civ. No. 08\xe2\x80\x93226 MO (D Ore., Oct. 27, 2008), App. 13; <em>Jihad-Black</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, Civ. No. 08\xe2\x80\x93227 MO (D Ore., Oct. 27, 2008), App. 25.  And in each instance the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court.  <em>Tablada</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, No. 07\xe2\x80\x9335538 (CA9, Apr. 10, 2009), App. 11; see also <em>Tablada </em>v. <em>Thomas</em>, 533 F.\xc2\xa03d 800 (CA9 2008).  Because the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s administration of good time credits affects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners, we granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to consider petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having now considered petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, we conclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and its purpose, taken together, convince us that the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method is lawful.  For one thing, that method tracks the language of \xc2\xa73624(b).  That provision says that a prisoner (serving a sentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less than life) \xe2\x80\x9cmay receive credit \xe2\x80\xa6 of up to 54 days <em>at the end of each year</em>\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination by the Bureau of Prisons that, <em>during that year, </em>the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d has behaved in an exemplary fashion.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  And it says that credit for the \xe2\x80\x9clast year or portion of a year \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As the example in Part I makes clear, the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation provides a prisoner entitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good time credit for each full year of imprisonment that he serves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any additional time served that is less than a full year.  And, as \xc2\xa73624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit <em>at the end of </em>each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for Year 9, which is subject to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s special instruction requiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks of the sentence).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 approach with the statute.  Their system awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is actually served.  Thus, a prisoner under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 system could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the fact that he would be released after less than 8<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2 years in prison.  The good time calculation for Year 10 would <em>not </em>be made<em> \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of\xe2\x80\x9d </em>Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks of a sentence ending during that year).  Neither could the BOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in exemplary fashion \xe2\x80\x9c<em>during that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>18 U.

Under the previous good time provision, a prisoner was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence beginning with the day on which the sentence commences to run.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984).  This deduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, was then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74165 (repealed 1984).  The present statute, \xc2\xa73624 (2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which \xe2\x80\x9ccredit\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cearned\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of\xe2\x80\x9d the year based on an evaluation of behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  We agree with the Government that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he textual differences between the two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of prospective entitlement to a system of retrospective award.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 33; see also <em>White</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1002, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method better furthers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose.  The \xe2\x80\x9cgood time\xe2\x80\x9d provision in \xc2\xa73624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73551 <em>et seq.</em>, 28 U.

See USSG \xc2\xa71A3, p.\xc2\xa0s., at 1.2 (statutory objectives included \xe2\x80\x9chonesty in sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuniformity,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproportionality\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the sentence the offender actually served, <em>with a sole statutory exception for good time credits</em>.  <em>Mistretta</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 367 (a \xe2\x80\x9cprisoner is to be released at the completion of his sentence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior while in custody\xe2\x80\x9d (citing \xc2\xa73624(b)).  The reason for this exception is provided in \xc2\xa73624(b) itself: to provide an incentive for prisoners to \xe2\x80\x9ccompl[y] with institutional disciplinary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  The good time exception is limited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose\xe2\x80\x94credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BOP\xe2\x80\x99s approach furthers the objective of \xc2\xa73624.  It ties the award of good time credits directly to good behavior during the preceding year of imprisonment.  By contrast, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 approach, insofar is it would award up to 54 days per year of time <em>sentenced</em> as opposed to time <em>served</em>, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sentence that he offsets with earned good time credit.  In other words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award good time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in prison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that he will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our example.  By doing so, it loosens the statute\xe2\x80\x99s connection between good behavior and the award of good time and transforms the nature of the exception to the basic sentence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule.  And to that extent, it is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not convinced by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 several arguments against the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s methodology.  First, petitioners point to the statement in \xc2\xa73624(b) that a prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cmay receive credit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em> </em>(Emphasis added.)  The words \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment,\xe2\x80\x9d they say, must refer to the years of the term that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our example), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the prisoner actually served once good time credits were taken into account.  After all, the very first phrase of that provision makes eligible for good time credits \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner who is serving a <em>term of imprisonment </em>of more than 1 year other than a <em>term of imprisonment</em> for the duration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added; footnote omitted).  The words \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d in this phrase almost certainly<em> </em>refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actually served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a day would become ineligible for credit as soon as they earned it).  And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U. S. 115</a>, 118 (1994).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem for petitioners, however, is that this presumption is not absolute.  It yields readily to indications that the same phrase used in different parts of the same statute means different things, particularly where the phrase is one that speakers can easily use in different ways without risk of confusion.  <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932); <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cline</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/581/index.html">540 U. S. 581</a>, 595\xe2\x80\x93596 (2004).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 596\xe2\x80\x93597 (\xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d has different meanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U.

It can refer to the sentence that the judge imposes, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa73624(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cA prisoner shall be released\xe2\x80\x9d at the end of \xe2\x80\x9cthe prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment, less any time credited\xe2\x80\x9d for good behavior), but it also can refer to the time that the prisoner actually serves.  Thus, \xc2\xa73624(d) of the statute before us requires BOP to \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish [a] prisoner with \xe2\x80\xa6 suitable clothing[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 money, \xe2\x80\xa6 and \xe2\x80\xa6 transportation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the expiration of the <em>prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The statute here means to assure that the prisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of his actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in our example), not at the end of the term that the judge imposed (which would be over a year later).  Since the statute uses the same phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d in two different ways, the presumption cannot help petitioners here.  And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II, <em>supra</em>, context here indicates that the particular instance of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d at issue refers to prison time actually served rather than the sentence imposed by the judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  But those who consider legislative history significant cannot find that history helpful to petitioners here.  Petitioners point, for example, to a statement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sentencing Reform Act, which says that the \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of calculation\xe2\x80\x9d of good time \xe2\x80\x9cwill be considerably less complicated than under current law in many respects,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ccredit toward early release is earned at a steady and easily determined rate that will have an obvious impact on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release date.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p. 146\xe2\x80\x93147 (1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  But these statements are consistent with the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute.  Its method, as we understand it, is not particularly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than prior law, which provided for the accumulation of two different kinds of good time credit (general and industrial), calculated in different manners (prospectively and retrospectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on the length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10 days per month for general) or the year of employment (3 or 5 days per month for industrial).  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74161, 4162 (1982 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners also point to various statements contained in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s Conference Report and made by individual legislators that describe good time credit as providing sentence reductions of 15%.  See Brief for Petitioners 34\xe2\x80\x9336 (citing, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x931159, p. 415 (1984); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)).  But there is nothing in the context of these statements to suggest that they amounted to anything other than rough approximations or that they were made with the present controversy in mind.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x931159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount of maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days \xe2\x80\x9cincreases \xe2\x80\x98good time\xe2\x80\x99 that accrues from 10 percent to 15 percent\xe2\x80\x9d); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep. Hamilton) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about 80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of their time.  Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for good behavior\xe2\x80\x9d).  And whatever interpretive force one attaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives little weight to statements, such as those of the individual legislators, made <em>after </em>the bill in question has become law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a>, 298 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United States Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements issued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report).  In that Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of recent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had used to help draft the Guidelines.  The results of the analysis were presented in a table that permits comparison of the likely prison-time consequences of the new Guidelines with prison time actually served under pre-Guidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9coffense level that is closest to the average time \xe2\x80\xa6 served by first-time offenders\xe2\x80\x9d convicted of a particular crime, Supplementary Report 23).  Because the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9crefer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, because a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will serve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission adjusted the average time served \xe2\x80\x9cby dividing by 0.85 good time when the term exceeded 12 months.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This adjustment, the Commission explained, \xe2\x80\x9cmade sentences in the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later editions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of \xe2\x80\x9capproximately fifteen percent for good behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> USSG \xc2\xa71A3, p.\xe2\x80\x82s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain that the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the expectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive good time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not 15% of the time actually served.  They add that, in setting the Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exercised congressionally delegated power to interpret the Sentencing Reform Act, see <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 371\xe2\x80\x93379 (approving Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of the power to promulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that interpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843\xe2\x80\x93844 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, however, we can find no indication that the Commission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in the Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular question here before us, that is whether good time credit is to be based on time served or the sentence imposed.  The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authoritative account of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive views than the Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that subject.  Moreover, with respect to comparisons between Guidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the original 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did not \xe2\x80\x9csimply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as revealed by the data,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cdeparted from the data at different points for various important reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG \xc2\xa71A3, p.\xe2\x80\x82s., at 1.4; see also <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa71A4(g), p.\xe2\x80\x82s., at 1.11 (while \xe2\x80\x9cGuideline sentences in many instances will <em>approximate</em> existing [<em>i.e.</em>, pre-Guidelines] practice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission did \xe2\x80\x9cnot conside[r] itself bound by existing sentencing practice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Because the Commission has expressed no view on the question before us, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to deference had it done so.  If it turns out that the calculation of good time credit based on prison time served rather than the sentence imposed produces results that are more severe than the Commission finds appropriate, the Commission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accordingly.  See <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa71A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthe guideline-writing process is evolutionary\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Commission functions \xe2\x80\x9cas a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the nation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity and construe \xc2\xa73624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a way that will maximize the amount of available good time credit.  We may assume for present purposes that \xc2\xa73624(b) can be construed as imposing a criminal penalty.  See <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/381/index.html">447 U. S. 381</a>, 387 (1980) (rule of lenity applies to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretations of \xe2\x80\xa6 the penalties\xe2\x80\x9d imposed by \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prohibitions\xe2\x80\x9d); but see <em>Sash </em>v. <em>Zenk</em>, 428 F.\xc2\xa03d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding that \xc2\xa73624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of  the rule of lenity).  Even so, the rule of lenity only applies if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose, there remains a \xe2\x80\x9cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Muscarello </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/125/index.html">524 U. S. 125</a>, 139 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the Court must simply \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98guess as to what Congress intended.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bifulco</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 387 (quoting <em>Ladner </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/169/index.html">358 U. S. 169</a>, 178 (1958)).  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); <em>United States </em>v. <em>R.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>L.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/291/index.html">503 U. S. 291</a>, 305\xe2\x80\x93306 (1992) (plurality opinion).  Having so considered the statute, we do not believe that there remains a \xe2\x80\x9cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory provision before us.  Nor need we now simply \xe2\x80\x9cguess\xe2\x80\x9d what the statute means.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of \xc2\xa73624(b).  In our view, the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s calculation system applies that statute as its language is most naturally read, and in accordance with what that language makes clear is its basic purpose.  No one doubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the statute in accordance with its language and purposes; hence we need not determine the extent to which Congress has granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute more broadly, or differently than it has done here.  Cf. <em>Chevron</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 844\xe2\x80\x93845.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acknowledging that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments cannot carry the day, the dissent has proposed a \xe2\x80\x9cthird possibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 2 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), not raised by either party nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Criminal Code.  The dissent reads the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe administrative period along which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 3.  It derives from this reading the following method of calculation as applied to our 10-year example.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he sentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  At the end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to 54 days of credit for good behavior.  These credits immediately \xe2\x80\x9cgo toward completion of the next year\xe2\x80\x9d so that the prisoner need only serve \xe2\x80\x9canother 311 days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This process repeats itself until the \xe2\x80\x9c10th segment,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a prisoner receives an unspecified \xe2\x80\x9ccredit in a prorated amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the end, the prisoner will have served 10 \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, collectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days of credit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent claims \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eading \xe2\x80\x98term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x99 this way is consistent with all parts of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 4.  We see at least four problems.  First, the opening sentence of \xc2\xa73624(a) instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] prisoner shall be released\xe2\x80\x9d upon \xe2\x80\x9cthe expiration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment, less any time credited\xe2\x80\x9d for good behavior.  But if a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cperiod that a prisoner must complete in order to earn his freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 4, and it is \xe2\x80\x9caccounted for through a combination of prison time and credits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 3, then a prisoner should be released exactly at the end of his term of imprisonment (without any further adjustment).  Because the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach would require us to read words out of the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition cannot be used here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives credit \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of each year\xe2\x80\x9d based on behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach, however, a prisoner may receive credit at the end of each \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d presumably based on his behavior during that segment.  And because an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d is made up of some \xe2\x80\x9ccombination of service and credits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year.  We do not see how a system in which \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner may complete a particular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and receive full good time credit for doing so, can possibly represent the most natural reading of this statutory language.  Nor do we know, because the BOP has not had an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a \xe2\x80\x9cyear\xe2\x80\x9d lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and in which the \xe2\x80\x9cyears\xe2\x80\x9d of a single prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence may all be of different lengths), is easily administrable.  (We doubt that this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners than one, like the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s, that provides credit for actual years.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach, credit is earned at different rates during a single sentence.  For the first \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d in its 10-year example, the prisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit.  The ratio of credit earned to days served is .148.  For the second \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d the prisoner serves 311 days and earns 54 days of credit.  This time, the ratio of credit earned to days served is .174.  (For the last \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent tells us the prisoner will receive \xe2\x80\x9ccredit in a prorated amount,\xe2\x80\x9d but it does not tell us which ratio should be used for the proration.  <em>Post</em>, at 3.)  The use of different rates finds no support in the statute.  The dissent objects that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cprescribes no particular rate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, but in fact it does\xe2\x80\x9454 days of credit per year of good behavior\xe2\x80\x94and it further requires that credit for the last year be \xe2\x80\x9cprorated\xe2\x80\x9d using the same proportion.  Moreover, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s application of different rates leads to odd results.  For example, a model prisoner sentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in between) will serve a different number of days from one sentenced to a single 10-year term.  How can this be if both prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of their 10 years in prison?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, \xc2\xa73624(b)(2) provides that good time credit \xe2\x80\x9cshall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.\xe2\x80\x9d   (This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petitioners, who committed their offenses before it was amended in 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to apply more broadly.  See <em>post</em>, at 9 (noting the effect on \xe2\x80\x9calmost 200,000 federal prisoners\xe2\x80\x9d).)  Yet under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach, credit appears to vest immediately.  See <em>post</em>, at 3 (Days of credit for the first year \xe2\x80\x9cgo toward completion of the next year\xe2\x80\x9d so that the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cwould need another 311 days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end\xe2\x80\x9d).  And if it does not, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.  What happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a prisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him by taking away all of his previously earned credit?  Cf. 28 CFR \xc2\xa7541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited acts).  Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of all of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the prisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d?  (Again we do not know if the BOP would find such a system administrable, and we doubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a prisoner.)  If so, does the prisoner have a second opportunity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that he had previously completed but now must account for again?  Cf. \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cCredit that has not been earned may not later be granted\xe2\x80\x9d).  Or, having previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that segment, are prison authorities left without any incentive to offer for good behavior?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of lenity to support its interpretation.  But, the best efforts of the dissent notwithstanding, we still see no \xe2\x80\x9cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d that would trigger the rule\xe2\x80\x99s application.  We remain convinced that the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s approach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory language and the most consistent with its purpose.  Whatever the merits of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments, the statute does not require the BOP to accept them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s methodology is lawful.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">APPENDIX</f></p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">A fuller example of the BOP\xe2\x80\x99s method for calculating \xe2\x80\x9ccredit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendant is sentenced to 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  As a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is awarded the maximum credit of 54 days at the end of each year served in prison.  At the end of Year 8, the prisoner has 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumulated 432 days of good time credit.  Because the difference between the time remaining in his sentence and the amount of accumulated credit (<em>i.e.</em>, 730\xc2\xa0-\xc2\xa0432) is less than a year (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in prison.  (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the 432 days of accumulated credit.)  Further, Year 9 will be a partial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year being offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here is where the elementary algebra comes in.  We know that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time served, must add up to 298.  This gives us our first equation: x\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0298.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the portion of the final year to the amount of time served in that year must equal the ratio of a full year\xe2\x80\x99s good time credit to the amount of time served in a full year.  The latter ratio is 54/365 or .148.  Thus, we know that x/y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.148, or to put it another way, x\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0.148y.  Because we know the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitution in our first equation to get .148y\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0298.  We then add the two y terms together (1.148y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0298), and we solve for y, which gives us y\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0260.  Now we can plug that value into our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).  If we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa038.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in Year 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time credit for that time served.  The prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s total good time is 470 days (432\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa038\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0470).  His total time served is 3180 days.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing as the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last year to more transparently track the relevant statutory language, we note that the mathematical formula can be used to calculate the amount of maximum available credit for an entire sentence.  Using the equations supplied above, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence by 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a defendant must serve in that sentence.  If we then subtract the number of days served from the total number of days in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number of good time credit days the prisoner can earn.  The statute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the \xe2\x80\x9clast year or portion\xe2\x80\x9d thereof).</p>\n</font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963326">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBARBER  V.

See Pet. for Cert. 11, and n. 2.  It adopts this reading despite the existence of an alternative interpretation that is more consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Absent a clear congressional directive, the statute ought not to be read as the Court reads it.  For the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation\xe2\x80\x94an interpretation that in my submission is quite incorrect\xe2\x80\x94imposes tens of thousands of years of additional prison time on federal prisoners according to a mathematical formula they will be unable to understand.  And if the only way to call attention to the human implications of this case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should be noted that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation comes at a cost to the taxpayers of untold millions of dollars.  See <em>id.,</em> at 11.  The interpretation the Court adopts, moreover, will be devastating to the prisoners who have behaved the best and will undermine the purpose of the statute.  These considerations, and those stated below, require this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal sentencing statute at issue here provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] prisoner who is serving a <em>term of imprisonment</em> of more than 1 year[,] other than a <em>term of imprisonment</em> for the duration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>term of imprisonment</em>, beginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year of the <em>term of imprisonment</em> shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccording to the Court, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d must mean \xe2\x80\x9ctime actually served\xe2\x80\x9d the third time that it appears in this particular subsection.  But the Court gives the phrase a different interpretation the first two times it is used in the very same sentence.  This in itself indicates that something is quite wrong here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners invite the Court to read \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentence imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  This, too, seems unworkable.  And it can be acknowledged that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of this interpretation is correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The choice, however, is not just between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading and that offered by petitioners.  There is a third possibility, one more consistent with the statute than either of these two alternatives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to accomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the span of time that a prisoner must account for in order to obtain release.  The length of the term is set at the outset by the criminal sentence imposed.  The prisoner earns release when that term has been fully completed.  Most of the term will be satisfied through time spent behind bars.  Assuming the prisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time credits along the way; and those credits may substitute for actual prison time.  Each year of the term comprises a full 365 days, which must be accounted for through a combination of prison time and credits.  Thus conceived, a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterm\xe2\x80\x9d is the administrative period along which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s example of a prisoner subject to a ten-year sentence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  The sentence is divided into ten 365-day segments.  Each segment constitutes a year of the term.  The prisoner will spend the first 365 days behind bars.  In the statute\xe2\x80\x99s words, he has reached \xe2\x80\x9cthe end of the first year of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d  Now is the time for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54 days if sufficiently well behaved.  Because he has already completed a full year of his term, those credits go toward completion of the next year.  If, based on good behavior, he has earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need another 311 days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 = 365).  If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incarceration will be required to reach 365.  Regardless, once the prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his term, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This process repeats itself for the third year of the term, and so on.  In the final year of his term (in this example, the tenth segment into which his term has been divided), the prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be awarded \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the last six weeks of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  This ensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year ten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit he no longer needs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term\xe2\x80\x94each of the ten administrative segments\xe2\x80\x94comprises 365 days that must be completed through a combination of service and credits.  By combining actual prison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may complete a particular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days.  As a result, credits may enable a well-behaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before ten calendar years have elapsed.  For a ten-year (3,650-day) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars if he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits.  This is 63 more days of credit than under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading\xe2\x80\x94more than 6 additional credit days for every year of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reading \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d this way is consistent with all parts of the statute.  The prisoner receives his credit \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of each year of [his] term of imprisonment,\xe2\x80\x9d a process that \xe2\x80\x9cbegin[s] at the end of the first year of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d  Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has proven well behaved \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  This interpretation fulfills the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective of \xc2\xa73624\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rewarding a prisoner for exemplary conduct during the preceding year.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach also has a textual integrity that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading does not: It gives \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d the same meaning each time it is used by the statute.  Every time it appears in \xc2\xa73624(b)(1), \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the administrative period that a prisoner must complete in order to earn his freedom.  The Court, by contrast, would read this phrase to mean \xe2\x80\x9ctime actually served\xe2\x80\x9d the third time it is used, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentence imposed\xe2\x80\x9d the first two times it is used (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a prisoner who is serving a <em>term of imprisonment</em> of more than 1 year[,] other than a <em>term of imprisonment</em> for the duration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation thus runs afoul of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (quoting <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U. S. 115</a>, 118 (1994)).  The inconsistency here is particularly egregious because all three uses appear in the same sentence.  See <em>id.,</em> at 118 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The] presumption [is] surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court responds by noting another part of the statute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive clothing, money, and transportation \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73624(d).  A prisoner is released at the end of his actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d must here refer to time actually served.  Yet release also comes at the end of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterm\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense described above\xe2\x80\x94that is, when the balance of the sentence has been reduced to zero through a combination of prison time and good time credits.  Indeed, this administrative use of the phrase fits well with the word \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration,\xe2\x80\x9d which in its most natural sense in this context refers to the close of a formal accounting period.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cA coming to an end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would have it, that a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s actual time behind bars is something that \xe2\x80\x9cexpires.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach produces yet another oddity.  The statute requires that prorated credit be awarded for \xe2\x80\x9cthe last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  One might naturally assume that the last year of a ten-year term would be year ten.  That is how things work under the approach described above, in which a ten-year sentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, a prisoner serving a ten-year sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year ten simply does not exist.  According to the Court, year nine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year: It lasts \xe2\x80\x9cno more than 298 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  If this sounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner who has just received his sentence and turns to the statute books to figure out when to expect his freedom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.  Instead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach described above.  None withstands examination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court notes that the statute requires the release of a prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cupon \xe2\x80\x98the expiration of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment, less any time credited\xe2\x80\x99 for good behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (quoting \xc2\xa73624(a)).  But if \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d truly refers to the entire span that a prisoner must complete to earn his freedom\xe2\x80\x94a period that accounts both for actual time and for good time credits\xe2\x80\x94then why would the \xe2\x80\x9cless any time credited\xe2\x80\x9d language be appropriate?  The answer is that this provision\xe2\x80\x94which appears at the very beginning of the section entitled \xe2\x80\x9cRelease of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94announces to a prisoner when release may be expected: when the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term expires, taking into account credit days \xe2\x80\x9cas provided in subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73624(a) (bold face deleted).  This use of language is common.  A debtor who says \xe2\x80\x9cI will write a check for what I owe you, less what you owe me\xe2\x80\x9d is simply saying \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed using different words, but this is hardly probative.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court alleges that the above approach conflicts with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that credit be awarded \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of each year\xe2\x80\x9d based upon behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  After all, if a year of the term can be satisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than a full calendar year.  Yet the statute does not require that credit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good behavior during a calendar year.  What it requires is that credit be awarded \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d for good behavior \xe2\x80\x9cduring that year.\xe2\x80\x9d  And this is precisely what the above approach does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above, prisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single sentence.  It admonishes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of different rates finds no support in the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This response is telling.  The statute, in fact, prescribes no particular rate\xe2\x80\x94and certainly no formula based on a rate\xe2\x80\x94except as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are eligible to earn \xe2\x80\x9cup to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  As to that command, the above approach is perfectly faithful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach causes credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.  Again, this is not true.  As per the statute, credit only vests \xe2\x80\x9con the date the prisoner is released from custody,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time before that date.  This gives prisoners approaching their release date an extra incentive to behave.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if     a prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year sentence.  Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to \xe2\x80\x9cretroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years] to 365 days\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  The answer is what one might suppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find himself precisely where he would have been if those credits had never been earned.  All years of the term remain 365 days, as they always have.  But a misbehaving prisoner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find himself without the benefit of those 500 days.  That will leave him with more of his term to complete\xe2\x80\x94500 days more, to be precise.  If he behaves well again, he can resume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he has lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.  See \xc2\xa73624(b)(1).  This is not at all confusing for a prisoner; and certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s view causes a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to shrink over time according to an algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbehaves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the above approach difficult to administer.  The Court identifies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist.  The information used to calculate a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s term under the above approach is the same as it is under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  True, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit on different calendar days during the course of his term.  But under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, this also happens when awarding credit in the final year.  And, it goes without saying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on different calendar days anyway, so that under any approach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners throughout the calendar year.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa73624(b)(1), therefore, is less consistent with the text than the reading explained above.  But even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under any fair application the rule of lenity should tip the balance in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  When a penal statute is susceptible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the defendant must be chosen unless \xe2\x80\x9ctext, structure, and history \xe2\x80\xa6 establish that the [harsher] position is unambiguously correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Granderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/39/index.html">511 U. S. 39</a>, 54 (1994).  Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity ensures that statutes provide \xe2\x80\x9cfair warning[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bass</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/index.html">404 U. S. 336</a>, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The rule thus applies \xe2\x80\x9cnot only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bifulco</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/381/index.html">447 U. S. 381</a>, 387 (1980).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court assumes without deciding that \xc2\xa73624(b) is penal in nature.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  No assumption is necessary: The statutory provision awarding good time credits \xe2\x80\x9cin fact is one determinant of [a] prison term,\xe2\x80\x9d so that a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffective sentence is altered once this determinant is changed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weaver</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/24/index.html">450 U. S. 24</a>, 32 (1981).  In <em>Weaver</em>, the Court considered whether an amendment to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s statutory formula for calculating good time credits implicated the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause.  The Court concluded that it did, as the new statute \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime already completed, and therefore change[d] \xe2\x80\x98the quantum of punishment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 33 (quoting <em>Dobbert</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/index.html">432 U. S. 282</a>, 294 (1977)).  For the same reason, the penal effect of \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the rule of lenity.  We should not disadvantage almost 200,000 federal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them they would face that harsh result.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x94although not the Court\xe2\x80\x94argues that we should embrace its interpretation out of deference to BOP.  BOP has been charged by the Attorney General with responsibility for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pproving inmate disciplinary and good time regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 CFR \xc2\xa70.96(s) (2009).  BOP has long followed the same credit-calculation method now advocated by the Court.  The Government argues that we should defer to BOP\xe2\x80\x99s choice as a permissible exercise of its delegated responsibility.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument fails on multiple levels.  There is no indication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive authority that would merit deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984).  The statute does not create a legislative gap for BOP to fill.  To the contrary, the procedures that govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in great detail.  Cf. <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/230/index.html">531 U. S. 230</a>, 241\xe2\x80\x93242 (2001) (where statute says that BOP \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d grant early release to certain prisoners, without specifying further criteria, Congress deliberately created a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory gap\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute even goes so far as to explain what to do \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the date for a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73624(a).  This legislative specificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions that do delegate authority to BOP.  <em>E.g.,</em> \xc2\xa73624(b)(1) (awarding of credit is \xe2\x80\x9csubject to determination\xe2\x80\x9d by BOP that the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9chas displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any \xe2\x80\x9cformal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement\xe2\x80\x9d with the force of law.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (2001).  In 2005, BOP made final an administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology. 70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR \xc2\xa7523.20).  But when pressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP conceded that it had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to articulate in the administrative record the rationale upon which it relied when it promulgated\xe2\x80\x9d the rule.  <em>Tablada</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 533 F.\xc2\xa03d 800, 805 (CA9 2008).  The Court of Appeals accepted BOP\xe2\x80\x99s concession, <em>ibid.</em>, and that aspect of its ruling has not been appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a fallback position, the Government argues that BOP\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation should receive at least some deference under <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a> (1944).  But under <em>Skidmore</em>, an agency decision only merits \xe2\x80\x9crespect proportional to its \xe2\x80\x98power to persuade.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 235 (quoting <em>Skidmore</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 140).  BOP\xe2\x80\x99s position is of long standing, but the administrative record is noteworthy for what it does not contain\xe2\x80\x94namely, any reasoned justification for preferring BOP\xe2\x80\x99s methodology over statutorily permissible alternatives.  BOP has consistently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is the only one that can be squared with the text.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule asserting that the correct methodology \xe2\x80\x9chad been clearly stated by statute since the implementation of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, at no point did BOP consider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation outlined here.  Cf. <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Koray</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/50/index.html">515 U. S. 50</a>, 60\xe2\x80\x9361 (1995) (deferring to BOP\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned decision to reject one interpretation in favor of another).  An agency need not consider all possible alternatives.  But deference is not owed to an agency view, however consistently held, that from the start has been premised on legal error.  See <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228; <em>Skidmore</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 140.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The straightforward interpretation urged here accords with the purpose of the statute, which is to give prisoners incentive for good behavior and dignity from its promised reward.  Prisoners can add 54 days to each year.  And when they do so, they have something tangible.  In place of that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar that can be marked, the Court insists on something different.  It advocates an interpretation that uses different definitions for the same phrase in the same sentence; denies prisoners the benefit of the rule of lenity; and caps off its decision with an appendix that contains an algebraic formula to hang on a cell wall.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To a prisoner, time behind bars is not some theoretical or mathematical concept.  It is something real, even terrifying.  Survival itself may be at stake.  See Dept. of\xc2\xa0Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, C.

To this time, the Court adds days\xe2\x80\x94compounded to years.  We should not embrace this harsh result where Congress itself has not done so in clear terms.  I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
