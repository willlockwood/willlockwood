JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>These three libels in admiralty <em>in personam</em> were brought in the federal court for western New York by owners of cargo laden on the steamer <em>Yorkton</em> to recover for loss resulting from the sinking of that vessel in a collision with respondent\'s steamer <em>Mantadoc</em> in Lake Superior on the American side of the international boundary line.  The respondent moved, in each case, that the district court exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction and dismiss the libels on the ground that all the parties were citizens of Canada, and that the controversy concerned "matters . . . properly the subjects of hearing and determination" by the Canadian courts.  The motions were granted, 49 F.2d 802, 804, and the decrees of the district court were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 51 F.2d 1007.  This Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the collision, the Wreck Commissioner of Canada held a formal investigation, as required by law, respecting the circumstances of the collision, and determined that the masters of both vessels were at fault.  The respondent then instituted in the Admiralty Court of Canada a proceeding for the judicial determination of the liability as between the colliding vessels and their owners.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 285 U. S. 418</a></p><p> The libelants\' motive for invoking the jurisdiction of a court of the United States instead of that of the Canadian court in which that proceeding was pending appears in affidavits filed with the exceptions to the libel.  Under the Canadian law, it is stated, if both colliding vessels were at fault, each vessel would be liable for not more than half of the loss, and the salvaged value of the <em>Yorkton</em> might not suffice to pay its share.  <em>See The Milan,</em> Lush.Adm. 401.  Under our law, the innocent cargo owner can recover full damages from the noncarrying vessel.  <em>The New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/187/case.html">175 U.

They claim, however, that the rule is not applicable here, since the cause of action arose within the territorial limits of the United States, and, moreover, that if the District Court had discretion, the decrees should be reversed because, on the undisputed facts, it was an abuse of discretion to decline jurisdiction.  We are of opinion that neither claim is well founded.</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  The contention that the jurisdiction was obligatory rests upon the fact that the collision occurred within the territorial waters of the United States.  The argument is that a cause of action arising from a collision occurring on territorial waters of the United States arises out of its laws, since within its territory there can be no other law, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/42/28/case.html">Smith v.

The suggestion drawn from the language in <em>The Belgenland, supra,</em> that such discretion exists only "in cases arising beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the country to which the courts belong" is without support in either the earlier or the later decisions of this Court.  Nor is it justified by the language relied on, when that language is read in its context.  The case of <em>The Belgenland</em> arose out of a collision on the high seas between foreign vessels of different nationalities, and the objection was raised that the courts of the United States were wholly without jurisdiction.  Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the Court, replied that jurisdiction in admiralty did exist over controversies between foreigners arising without the territorial waters of this country, but that the court, in such a case, would use its discretion in determining whether to exercise it.  That the Court had no intention of denying the existence of similar discretion where the cause of action arose within the territorial waters of this country is shown by its reference to the cases of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/76/435/case.html">The Maggie Hammond,</a></span></em> 9 Wall. 435,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/76/435/case.html#457">76 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The question has most frequently been presented in suits by foreign seamen against masters or owners of foreign vessels, relating to claims for wages and like differences, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] or to claims of personal injury. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Although such cases are ordinarily decided according </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 285 U. S. 422</a></p><p> to the foreign law, they often concern causes of action arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  <em>Compare Patterson v.

Neither in these nor in other cases has the bare circumstance of where the cause of action arose been treated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise discretion whether to take jurisdiction. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Obviously the proposition that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it is not universally true, else the admiralty court could never decline jurisdiction on the ground that the litigation is between foreigners.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The decisions relied upon by libelants are inapposite for several reasons.

All the parties were not only foreigners, but were citizens of Canada.  Both the colliding vessels were registered under the laws of Canada, and each was owned by a Canadian corporation.  The officers and the crew of each vessel -- the material witnesses -- were citizens and residents of that country, and so would not be available for compulsory attendance in the district court.  The cargo in each case was shipped under a Canadian bill of lading from one Canadian port to another.  The collision occurred at a point where the inland waters narrowed to a neck, and the district court concluded that the colliding vessels proceeded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 285 U. S. 424</a></p><p> in United States waters unintentionally.  If the libelants are entitled to have applied the law of the United States in respect to the liability, the Canadian courts will, it must be assumed, give effect to it.  The district court embodied in the decrees an order that the respondent should appear and file security in any action which might be instituted by the petitioners in the admiralty courts of Canada, so that petitioners would not, by dismissal of the libels, lose the security gained by the foreign attachment.  It is difficult to conceive of a state of facts more clearly justifying the refusal of a district court to retain jurisdiction in a cause between foreigners.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

In <em>The Bifrost,</em> 8 F.2d 361, 362, jurisdiction was declined in an action by foreign seamen for breach of contract in shipping articles, although it was urged that the articles were signed in this country and governed by its law.  <em>See also Fairgrieve v.
