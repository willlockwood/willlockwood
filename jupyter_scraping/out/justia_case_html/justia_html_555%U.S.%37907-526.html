SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93526.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 3, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 24, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), enacted in 1934, authorizes the Secretary of Interior, a respondent here, to acquire land and hold it in trust \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465, and defines \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7479.  The Narragansett Tribe was placed under the Colony of Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s formal guardianship in 1709.  It agreed to relinquish its tribal authority and sell all but two acres of its remaining reservation land in 1880, but then began trying to regain its land and tribal status.  From 1927 to 1937, federal authorities declined to give it assistance because they considered the Tribe to be under state, not federal jurisdiction.  In a 1978 agreement settling a dispute between the Tribe and Rhode Island, the Tribe received title to 1,800 acres of land in petitioner Charlestown in exchange for relinquishing claims to state land based on aboriginal title; and it agreed that the land would be subject to state law.  The Tribe gained formal recognition from the Federal Government in 1983, and the Secretary of Interior accepted a deed of trust to the 1,800 acres in 1988.  Subsequently, a dispute arose over whether the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s plans to build housing on an additional 31 acres of land it had purchased complied with local regulations.  While litigation was pending, the Secretary accepted the 31-acre parcel into trust.  The Interior Board of Indian Appeals upheld that decision, and petitioners sought review. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Secretary and other officials, determining that \xc2\xa7479\xe2\x80\x99s plain language defines \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d to include members of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not require a tribe to have been federally recognized on that date; and concluding that, since the Tribe is currently federally recognized and was in existence in 1934, it is a tribe under \xc2\xa7479.  In affirming, the First Circuit found \xc2\xa7479 ambiguous as to the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow under Federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d applied the principles of <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843, and deferred to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the provision to allow the land to be taken into trust.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the term \xe2\x80\x9cnow under federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 unambiguously refers to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in 1934, and because the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Secretary does not have the authority to take the 31-acre parcel into trust.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0When a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text is plain and unambiguous, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 4, the statute must be applied according to its terms, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dodd</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/353/index.html">545 U. S. 353</a>, 359.  Here, whether the Secretary has authority to take the parcel into trust depends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a \xe2\x80\x9crecognized Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d which, in turn, depends on whether \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d refers to 1998, when the Secretary accepted the parcel into trust, or 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA.  The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow,\xe2\x80\x9d as understood at the time of enactment, was at \xe2\x80\x9cthe present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  That definition is consistent with interpretations given \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court both before and after the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  See <em>e.g., Franklin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/216/559/index.html">216 U. S. 559</a>, 569; <em>Montana</em> v. <em>Kennedy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/308/index.html">366 U. S. 308</a>, 310\xe2\x80\x93311.  It also aligns with the word\xe2\x80\x99s natural reading in the context of the IRA.  Furthermore, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s current interpretation is at odds with the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa7479 at the time of enactment.  The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments in support of his contention that \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous are unpersuasive.  There is also no need to consider the parties\xe2\x80\x99 competing views on whether Congress had a policy justification for limiting the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s trust authority to tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934, since Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 speaks for itself and \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connecticut Nat.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465.  The IRA defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7479.  The Secretary notified petitioners\xe2\x80\x94the State of Rhode Island, its Governor, and the town of Charlestown, Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x94that he intended to accept in trust a parcel of land for use by the Narragansett Indian Tribe in accordance with his claimed authority under the statute.  In proceedings before the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA), the District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, petitioners unsuccessfully challenged the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to take the parcel into trust.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reviewing the determination of the Court of Appeals, we are asked to interpret the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow under Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479.  Petitioners contend that the term \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, and permits the Secretary to take land into trust for members of recognized tribes that were \xe2\x80\x9cunder Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in 1934.  The respondents argue that the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d is an ambiguous term that can reasonably be construed to authorize the Secretary to take land into trust for members of tribes that are \xe2\x80\x9cunder Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d at the time that the land is accepted into trust.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with petitioners and hold that, for purposes of \xc2\xa7479, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow under Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a tribe that was under federal jurisdiction at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  As a result, \xc2\xa7479 limits the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to taking land into trust for the purpose of providing land to members of a tribe that was under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in June 1934.  Because the record in this case establishes that the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted, the Secretary does not have the authority to take the parcel at issue into trust.  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time of colonial settlement, the Narragansett Indian Tribe was the indigenous occupant of much of what is now the State of Rhode Island.  See Final Determination of Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (1983) (hereinafter Final Determination).  Initial relations between colonial settlers, the Narragansett Tribe, and the other Indian tribes in the region were peaceful, but relations deteriorated in the late 17th century.  The hostilities peaked in 1675 and 1676 during the 2-year armed conflict known as King Philip\xe2\x80\x99s War.  Hundreds of colonists and thousands of Indians died.  See E. Schultz &amp; M. Tougias, King Philip\xe2\x80\x99s War 5 (1999).  The Narragansett Tribe, having been decimated, was placed under formal guardianship by the Colony of Rhode Island in 1709.  48 Fed. Reg. 6177.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not quite two centuries later, in 1880, the State of Rhode Island convinced the Narragansett Tribe to relinquish its tribal authority as part of an effort to assimilate tribal members into the local population.  See <em>Narragansett Indian Tribe </em>v. <em>National Indian Gaming Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 158 F.\xc2\xa03d 1335, 1336 (CADC 1998).  The Tribe also agreed to sell all but two acres of its remaining reservation land for $5,000.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Almost immediately, the Tribe regretted its decisions and embarked on a campaign to regain its land and tribal status.  <em>Ibid.  </em>In the early 20th century, members of the Tribe sought economic support and other assistance from the Federal Government.  But, in correspondence spanning a 10-year period from 1927 to 1937, federal officials declined their request, noting that the Tribe was, and always had been, under the jurisdiction\nof the New England States, rather than the Federal\nGovernment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having failed to gain recognition or assistance from the United States or from the State of Rhode Island, the Tribe filed suit in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s to recover its ancestral land, claiming that the State had misappropriated its territory in violation of the Indian Non-Intercourse Act, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7177.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The claims were resolved in 1978 by enactment of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat. 813, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701 <em>et seq</em>.  Under the agreement codified by the Settlement Act, the Tribe received title to 1,800 acres of land in Charlestown, Rhode Island, in exchange for relinquishing its past and future claims to land based on aboriginal title.  The Tribe also agreed that the 1,800 acres of land received under the Settlement Act \xe2\x80\x9cshall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71708(a); see also \xc2\xa71712(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Narragansett Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing efforts to gain recognition from the United States Government finally succeeded in 1983.  48 Fed. Reg. 6177.  In granting formal recognition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determined that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Narragansett community and its predecessors have existed autonomously since first contact, despite undergoing many modifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>, </em>at 6178.  The BIA referred to the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdocumented history dating from 1614\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that \xe2\x80\x9call of the current membership are believed to be able to trace to at least one ancestor on the membership lists of the Narragansett community prepared after the 1880 Rhode Island \xe2\x80\x98detribalization\xe2\x80\x99 act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> After obtaining federal recognition, the Tribe began urging the Secretary to accept a deed of trust to the 1,800 acres conveyed to it under the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act.  25 CFR \xc2\xa783.2 (2008) (providing that federal recognition is needed before an Indian tribe may seek \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection, services, and benefits of the Federal government\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Secretary acceded to the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s request in 1988.  See <em>Town of Charlestown, Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Eastern Area Director, Bur. of Indian Affairs</em>, 18 IBIA 67, 69 (1989).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s housing authority purchased an additional 31 acres of land in the town of Charlestown adjacent to the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s 1,800 acres of settlement lands.  Soon thereafter, a dispute arose about whether the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s planned construction of housing on that parcel had to comply with local regulations.  <em>Narragansett Indian Tribe </em>v. <em>Narragansett Elec. Co.</em>, 89 F.\xc2\xa03d 908, 911\xe2\x80\x93912 (CA1 1996).  The Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument for noncompliance\xe2\x80\x94that its ownership of the parcel made it a \xe2\x80\x9cdependent Indian community\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cIndian country\xe2\x80\x9d under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71151\xe2\x80\x94ultimately failed.  89 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 913\xe2\x80\x93922.  But, while the litigation was pending, the Tribe sought an alternative solution to free itself from compliance with local regulations: It asked the Secretary to accept the 31-acre parcel into trust for the Tribe pursuant to 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465.  By letter dated March 6, 1998, the Secretary notified petitioners of his acceptance of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s land into trust.  Petitioners appealed the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the IBIA, which upheld the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  See <em>Town of Charlestown, Rhode Island</em> v. <em>Eastern Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs</em>, 35 IBIA 93 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners sought review of the IBIA decision pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary and other Department of Interior officials.  As relevant here, the District Court determined that the plain language of 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479 defines \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d to include members of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not require a tribe to have been federally recognized on that date.  <em>Carcieri </em>v. <em>Norton</em>, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167, 179\xe2\x80\x93181 (RI 2003).  According to the District Court, because it is currently \xe2\x80\x9cfederally-recognized\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexisted at the time of the enactment of the IRA,\xe2\x80\x9d the Narragansett Tribe \xe2\x80\x9cqualifies as an \xe2\x80\x98Indian tribe\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of \xc2\xa7479.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 181.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cthe secretary possesses authority under \xc2\xa7465 to accept lands into trust for the benefit of the Narragansetts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, first in a panel decision, <em>Carcieri </em>v. <em>Norton</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 45 (2005), and then sitting en banc, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 15 (CA1 2008).  Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne might have an initial instinct to read the word \xe2\x80\x98now\xe2\x80\x99 [in \xc2\xa7479] . . . to mean the date of [the] enactment of the statute, June 18, 1934,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that there was \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity as to whether to view the term \xe2\x80\xa6 as operating at the moment Congress enacted it or at the moment the Secretary invokes it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 26.  The Court of Appeals noted that Congress has used the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in other statutes to refer to the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application, not its enactment.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The Court of Appeals also found that the particular statutory context of \xc2\xa7479 did not clarify the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow.\xe2\x80\x9d  On one hand, the Court of Appeals noted that another provision within the IRA, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7472, uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cnow or hereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d which supports petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that \xe2\x80\x9cnow,\xe2\x80\x9d by itself, does not refer to future events.  But on the other hand, \xc2\xa7479 contains the particular application date of \xe2\x80\x9cJune 1, 1934,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that if Congress had wanted to refer to the date of enactment, it could have done so more specifically.  497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 27.  The Court of Appeals further reasoned that both interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d are supported by reasonable policy explanations, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, and it found that the legislative history failed to \xe2\x80\x9cclearly resolve the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having found the statute ambiguous, the Court of Appeals applied the principles set forth in <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984), and deferred to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the provision.  497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 30.  The court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was an impermissible construction of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 30\xe2\x80\x9334.  It also held that petitioners had failed to demonstrate that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was inconsistent with earlier practices of the Department of Interior.  Furthermore, the court determined that even if the interpretation were a departure from the Department\xe2\x80\x99s prior practices, the decision should be affirmed based on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasoned explanation for his interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U.

At that time, the primary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t the present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1671 (2d ed. 1934); see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1262 (3d ed. 1933) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t this time, or at the present moment\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]ow\xe2\x80\x99 as used in a statute <em>ordinarily</em> refers to the date of its taking effect \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  This definition is consistent with interpretations given to the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court, both before and after passage of the IRA, with respect to its use in other statutes.

For example, in the original version of 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465, which provided the same authority to the Secretary to accept land into trust for \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of providing land for Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress explicitly referred to current events, stating \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat no part of such funds shall be used to acquire additional land outside of the exterior boundaries of [the] Navajo Indian Reservation . . . in the event that the proposed Navajo boundary extension measures <em>now </em>pending in Congress \xe2\x80\xa6 become law.\xe2\x80\x9d  IRA, \xc2\xa75, 48 Stat. 985 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In addition, elsewhere in the IRA, Congress expressly drew into the statute contemporaneous <em>and </em>future events by using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow or hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 25 U.

Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision, without the accompanying phrase \xe2\x80\x9cor hereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d thus provides further textual support for the conclusion that the term refers solely to events contemporaneous with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U.

In correspondence with those who would assist him in implementing the IRA, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier, explained that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSection 19 of the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat.

S. 469</a>, 476 (1992), we agree with his conclusion that the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 limits the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore limits the exercise of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s trust authority under \xc2\xa7465 to those members of tribes that were under federal jurisdiction at the time the IRA was enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary makes two other arguments in support of his contention that the term \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7479 is ambiguous.  We reject them both.  First, the Secretary argues that although the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of \xe2\x80\x98now\xe2\x80\x99 can refer to the time of enactment\xe2\x80\x9d in the abstract, \xe2\x80\x9cit can also refer to the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 18.  But the susceptibility of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d to alternative meanings \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not render the word . . . whenever it is used, ambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly where \xe2\x80\x9call but one of the meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Deal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/129/index.html">508 U. S. 129</a>, 131\xe2\x80\x93132 (1993).  Here, the statutory context makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean \xe2\x80\x9cnow or hereafter\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Had Congress intended to legislate such a definition, it could have done so explicitly, as it did in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7468 and 472, or it could have omitted the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d altogether.  Instead, Congress limited the statute by the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwe are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Sonotone Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/index.html">442 U. S. 330</a>, 339 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Secretary argues that \xc2\xa7479 left a gap for the agency to fill by using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall<em> </em>include\xe2\x80\x9d in its introductory clause.  Brief for Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The Secretary, in turn, claims to have permissibly filled that gap by defining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Tribe\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Individual Indian\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d without reference to the date of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 28 (citing 25 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7151.2(b), (c)(1) (2008)).  But, as explained above, Congress left no gap in 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479 for the agency to fill.  Rather, it explicitly and comprehensively defined the term by including only three discrete definitions: \xe2\x80\x9c[1] members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and [2] all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and . . . [3] all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other statutory provisions, Congress chose to expand the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to particular Indian tribes not necessarily encompassed within the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in \xc2\xa7479.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Had it understood the word \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 to encompass tribes other than those satisfying one of the three \xc2\xa7479 definitions, Congress would have not needed to enact these additional statutory references to specific Tribes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary and his <em>amici </em>also go beyond the statutory text to argue that Congress had no policy justification for limiting the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s trust authority to those tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934, because the IRA was intended to strengthen Indian communities as a whole, regardless of their status in 1934.  Petitioners counter that the main purpose of \xc2\xa7465 was to reverse the loss of lands that Indians sustained under the General Allotment Act, see <em>Atkinson Trading Co.</em> v. <em>Shirley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/645/index.html">532 U. S. 645</a>, 650, n.\xc2\xa01 (2001), so the statute was limited to tribes under federal jurisdiction at that time because they were the tribes who lost their lands.  We need not consider these competing policy views, because Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 speaks for itself and \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connecticut Nat.

We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Secretary and several <em>amici </em>argue that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 is rendered irrelevant by the broader definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 and by the fact that the statute authorizes the Secretary to take title to lands \xe2\x80\x9cin the name of the United States in trust for the <em>Indian tribe</em> or individual Indian for which the land is acquired.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7465 (emphasis added); Brief for Respondents 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  But the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 itself refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany <em>Indian</em> tribe\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), and therefore is limited by the temporal restrictions that apply to \xc2\xa7479\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7479<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98tribe\xe2\x80\x99 wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any <em>Indian</em> tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And, although \xc2\xa7465 authorizes the United States to take<em> </em>land in trust for an Indian tribe, \xc2\xa7465 limits the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of that authority \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  There simply is no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d in delineating the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 465 and 479.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>amicus</em> National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) argues that 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72202, which was enacted as part of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), Title II, 96 Stat. 2517, overcomes the limitations set forth in \xc2\xa7479 and, in turn, authorizes the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s action.  Section 2202 provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of section 465 of this title shall apply to all tribes notwithstanding the provisions of section 478 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this section is intended to supersede any other provision of Federal law which authorizes, prohibits, or restricts the acquisition of land for Indians with respect to any specific tribe, reservation, or state(s).\xe2\x80\x9d  (Alteration in original.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nNCAI argues that the \xe2\x80\x9cILCA independently grants authority under Section 465 for the Secretary to execute the challenged trust acquisition.\xe2\x80\x9d  NCAI Brief 8.  We do not agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain language of \xc2\xa72202 does not expand the power set forth in \xc2\xa7465, which requires that the Secretary take land into trust only \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does \xc2\xa72202 alter the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479, which is limited to members of tribes that were under federal jurisdiction in 1934.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9312.  Rather, \xc2\xa72202 by its terms simply ensures that tribes may benefit from \xc2\xa7465 even if they opted out of the IRA pursuant to \xc2\xa7478, which allowed tribal members to reject the application of the IRA to their tribe.  \xc2\xa7478 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Act shall not apply to any reservation wherein a majority of the adult Indians . . . shall vote against its application\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, there is no conflict between \xc2\xa72202 and the limitation on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to take lands contained in \xc2\xa7465.  Rather, \xc2\xa72202 provides additional protections to those who satisfied the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479 at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, but opted out of the IRA shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0NCAI\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa72202 also would nullify the plain meaning of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in \xc2\xa7479 and incorporated into \xc2\xa7465.  Consistent with our obligation to give effect to every provision of the statute, <em>Reiter</em>, 442 U.

Linguistically speaking, the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow under Federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479, may refer to a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional status as of 1934.  But one could also read it to refer to the time the Secretary of the Interior exercises his authority to take land \xe2\x80\x9cfor Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7465.  Compare <em>Montana</em> v. <em>Kennedy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/308/index.html">366 U. S. 308</a>, 311\xe2\x80\x93312 (1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d refers to time of statutory enactment), with <em>Difford</em> v. <em>Secretary of HHS</em>, 910 F.\xc2\xa02d 1316, 1320 (CA6 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d refers to time of exercise of delegated authority); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Lusk\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</em>, 336 Pa. 465, 467\xe2\x80\x93468, 9 A.\xc2\xa02d 363, 365 (1939) (property \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d owned refers to property owned when a will becomes operative).  I also concede that the Court owes the Interior Department the kind of interpretive respect that reflects an agency\xe2\x80\x99s greater knowledge of the circumstances in which a statute was enacted, cf. <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a> (1944).  Yet because the Department then favored the Court\xe2\x80\x99s present interpretation, see <em>infra</em>, at 2, that respect cannot help the Department here.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither can <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984), help the Department.  The scope of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d raises an interpretive question of considerable importance; the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history makes clear that Congress focused directly upon that language, believing it definitively resolved a specific underlying difficulty; and nothing in that history indicates that Congress believed departmental expertise should subsequently play a role in fixing the temporal reference of the word \xe2\x80\x9cnow.\xe2\x80\x9d  These circumstances indicate that Congress did not intend to delegate interpretive authority to the Department.  Consequently, its interpretation is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference, despite linguistic ambiguity.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 227, 229\xe2\x80\x93230 (2001).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, I am persuaded that \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cin 1934\xe2\x80\x9d not only for the reasons the Court gives but also because an examination of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history convinces me that Congress so intended.  As I read that history, it shows that Congress expected the phrase would make clear that the Secretary could employ \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s power to take land into trust in favor only of those tribes in respect to which the Federal Government already had the kinds of obligations that the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d imply.  See Hearings on S. 2755 et\xc2\xa0al.: A Bill to Grant to Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom to Organize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and Economic Enterprise, before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 263\xe2\x80\x93266 (1934).  Indeed, the very Department official who suggested the phrase to Congress during the relevant legislative hearings subsequently explained its meaning in terms that the Court now adopts.  See Letter from John Collier, Commissioner, to Superintendents (Mar. 7, 1936), Lodging of Respondents (explaining that \xc2\xa7479 included \xe2\x80\x9cpersons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe that was under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, an interpretation that reads \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning \xe2\x80\x9cin 1934\xe2\x80\x9d may prove somewhat less restrictive than it at first appears.  That is because a tribe may have been \xe2\x80\x9cunder Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in 1934 even though the Federal Government did not believe so at the time.  We know, for example, that following the Indian Reorganization Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the Department compiled a list of 258 tribes covered by the Act; and we also know that it wrongly left certain tribes off the list. See Brief for Law Professors Specializing in Federal Indian Law as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9324; Quinn, Federal Acknowledgment of American Indian Tribes: The Historical Development of a Legal Concept, 34 Am. J. Legal Hist. 331, 356\xe2\x80\x93359 (1990).  The Department later recognized some of those tribes on grounds that showed that it should have recognized them in 1934 even though it did not.  And the Department has sometimes considered that circumstance sufficient to show that a tribe was \xe2\x80\x9cunder Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in 1934\xe2\x80\x94even though the Department did not know it at the time.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     The statute, after all, imposes no time limit upon recognition.  See \xc2\xa7479 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98Indian\xe2\x80\x99 . . . shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of <em>any recognized</em> Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And administrative practice suggests that the Department has accepted this possibility.  The Department, for example, did not recognize the Stillaguamish Tribe until 1976, but its reasons for recognition in 1976 included the fact that the Tribe had maintained treaty rights against the United States since 1855.  Consequently, the Department concluded that land could be taken into trust for the Tribe.  See Memorandum from Associate Solicitor, Indian Affairs to Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs, Request for Reconsideration of Decision Not to Take Land in Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe (Oct. 1, 1980), Lodging of Respondents 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Similarly, in 1934 the Department thought that the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians had long since been dissolved.  <em>Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &amp; Chippewa Indians</em> v.<em> Office of U. S. Attorney for Western Dist. of Mich.</em>, 369 F.\xc2\xa03d 960, 961, and n.\xc2\xa02 (CA6 2004).  But later the Department recognized the Tribe, considering it to have existed continuously since 1675.  45 Fed. Reg. 19321 (1980).  Further, the Department in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s thought that an anthropological study showed that the Mole Lake Tribe no longer existed.  But the Department later decided that the study was wrong, and it then recognized the Tribe.  See Memorandum from the Solicitor to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758, 2762\xe2\x80\x932763 (Feb. 8, 1937) (recognizing the Mole Lake Indians as a separate tribe).  </p>\n<p>\n\n     In my view, this possibility\xe2\x80\x94that later recognition reflects earlier \xe2\x80\x9cFederal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94explains some of the instances of early Department administrative practice to which Justice Stevens refers.  I would explain the other instances to which Justice Stevens refers as involving the taking of land \xe2\x80\x9cfor\xe2\x80\x9d a tribe with members who fall under that portion of the statute that defines \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cpersons of one-half or more Indian blood,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7479.  See 1 Dept. of Interior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Affairs, 1917\xe2\x80\x931974, pp. 706\xe2\x80\x93707 (Shoshone Indians), 724\xe2\x80\x93725 (St. Croix Chippewas), 747\xe2\x80\x93748 (Nahma and Beaver Indians) (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n      Neither the Narragansett Tribe nor the Secretary has argued that the Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934.  Nor have they claimed that any member of the Narragansett Tribe satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cone-half or more Indian blood\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  And I have found nothing in the briefs that suggests the Narragansett Tribe could prevail on either theory.  Each of  the administrative decisions just discussed involved post-1934 recognition on grounds that implied a 1934 relationship between the tribe and Federal Government that could be described as jurisdictional, for example, a treaty with the United States (in effect in 1934), a (pre-1934) congressional appropriation, or enrollment (as of 1934) with the Indian Office.  I can find no similar indication of 1934 federal jurisdiction here. Instead, both the State and Federal Government considered the Narragansett Tribe as under <em>state, </em>but not under <em>federal, </em>jurisdiction in 1934.  And until the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s there was \xe2\x80\x9clittle Federal contact with the Narragansetts as a group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum from Deputy Assistant Secretary\xe2\x80\x94Indian Affairs (Operations) to Assistant Scretary\xe2\x80\x94Indian Affairs, Recommendation and Summary of Evidence for Proposed Finding for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island Pursuant to 25 CFR 83, p. 8 (July 29, 1982).   Because I see no realistic possibility that the Narragansett Tribe could prevail on the basis of a theory alternative to the theories argued here, I would not remand this case.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     With the qualifications here expressed, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and its judgment. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962815">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCARCIERI V.

The Act specifies that benefits shall be available to individuals who qualify as Indian either as a result of blood quantum or as descendants of members of \xe2\x80\x9cany recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479.  In contesting the Secretary of the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of trust land for the Narragansett Tribe of Rhode Island, the parties have focused on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet to my mind, whether \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d means 1934 (as the Court holds) or the present time (as respondents would have it) sheds no light on the question whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s actions on behalf of the Narragansett were permitted under the statute.  The plain text of the Act clearly authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust for Indian tribes as well as individual Indians, and it places no temporal limitation on the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Because the Narragansett Tribe is an Indian tribe within the meaning of the Act, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case involves a challenge to the Secretary of the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of a 31-acre parcel of land in Charlestown, Rhode Island, to be held in trust for the Narragansett Tribe.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That Tribe has existed as a continuous political entity since the early 17th century.  Although it was once one of the most powerful tribes in New England, a series of wars, epidemics, and difficult relations with the State of Rhode Island sharply reduced the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral landholdings.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two blows, delivered centuries apart, exacted a particularly high toll on the Tribe.  First, in 1675, King Philip\xe2\x80\x99s War essentially destroyed the Tribe, forcing it to accept the Crown as sovereign and to submit to the guardianship of the Colony of Rhode Island.  Then, in 1880, the State of Rhode Island passed a \xe2\x80\x9cdetribalization\xe2\x80\x9d law that abolished tribal authority, ended the State\xe2\x80\x99s guardianship of the Tribe, and attempted to sell all tribal lands.  The Narragansett originally assented to detribalization and ceded all but two acres of its ancestral land.  In return, the Tribe received $5,000.  See Memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) to Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) 4 (July 19, 1982) (Recommendation for Acknowledgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that its consent to detribalization was a mistake, the Tribe embarked on a century-long campaign to recoup its losses.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Obtaining federal recognition was critical to this effort.  The Secretary officially recognized the Narragansett as an Indian tribe in 1983, Final Determination for Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177, and with that recognition the Tribe qualified for the bundle of federal benefits established in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA or Act),[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7461 <em>et seq</em>.

See 25 CFR \xc2\xa783.2 (2008) (stating that recognition \xe2\x80\x9cis a prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal government available to Indian tribes by virtue of their status as tribes\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7151.2 (defining \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of land acquisition to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians, \xe2\x80\xa6 which is recognized by the Secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having separate definitions for \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d is essential for the administration of IRA benefits.  The statute reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to extend certain benefits to individual Indians, <em>e.g.</em>, 25 U.

In the years immediately following the adoption of the IRA, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior repeatedly advised that the Secretary could take land into trust for federally recognized tribes and for individual Indians who qualified for federal benefits by lineage or blood quantum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, in 1937, when evaluating whether the Secretary could purchase approximately 2,100 acres of land for the Mole Lake Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Solicitor instructed that the purchase could not be \xe2\x80\x9ccompleted until it is determined whether the beneficiary of the trust title should be designated as a band or whether the title should be taken for the individual Indians in the vicinity of Mole Lake who are of one half or more Indian blood.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum from the Solicitor to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758 (Feb. 8, 1937).  Because the Mole Lake Chippewa was not yet recognized by the Federal Government as an Indian tribe, the Solicitor determined that the Secretary had two options: \xe2\x80\x9cEither the Department should provide recognition of this group, or title to the purchased land should be taken on behalf of the individuals who are of one half or more Indian blood.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 2763.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tribal trust and individual trust options were similarly outlined in other post-1934 opinion letters, including those dealing with the Shoshone Indians of Nevada, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the Nahma and Beaver Island Indians of Michigan.  See 1 Dept. of Interior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Affairs, 1917\xe2\x80\x931974, pp. 706\xe2\x80\x93707, 724\xe2\x80\x93725, 747\xe2\x80\x93748 (1979).  Unless and until a tribe was formally recognized by the Federal Government and therefore eligible for trust land, the Secretary would take land into trust for individual Indians who met the blood quantum threshold.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Modern administrative practice has followed this well-trodden path.  Absent a specific statute recognizing a tribe and authorizing a trust land acquisition,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the Secretary has exercised his trust authority\xe2\x80\x94now governed by regulations promulgated in 1980 after notice-and-comment rulemaking, 25 CFR \xc2\xa7151 <em>et seq.;</em> 45 Fed. Reg. 62034\xe2\x80\x94to acquire land for federally recognized Indian tribes like the Narragansett.  The Grand Traverse Band of Ottowa and Chippewa Indians, although denied federal recognition in 1934 and 1943, see Dept. of Interior, Office of Federal Acknowledgement, Memorandum from Acting Deputy Commissioner to Assistant Secretary 4 (Oct. 3, 1979) (GTB\xe2\x80\x93V001\xe2\x80\x93D002), was the first tribe the Secretary recognized under the 1980 regulations, see 45 Fed. Reg. 19322.  Since then, the Secretary has used his trust authority to expand the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s land base.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 49 Fed. Reg. 2025\xe2\x80\x932026 (1984) (setting aside a 12.5-acre parcel as reservation land for the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive use).  The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana has similarly benefited from administrative recognition, 46 Fed. Reg. 38411 (1981), followed by tribal trust acquisition.  And in 2006, the Secretary took land into trust for the Snoqualmie Tribe which, although unrecognized as an Indian tribe in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, regained federal recognition in 1999.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 5067 (taking land into trust for the Tribe); 62 Fed. Reg. 45864 (1997) (recognizing the Snoqualmie as an Indian tribe).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This brief history of \xc2\xa7465 places the case before us into proper context.  Federal recognition, regardless of when it is conferred, is the necessary condition that triggers a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility to receive trust land.  No party has disputed that the Narragansett Tribe was properly recognized as an Indian tribe in 1983.  See 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.  Indeed, given that the Tribe has a documented history that stretches back to 1614 and has met the rigorous criteria for administrative recognition, Recommendation for Acknowledgment 1, 7\xe2\x80\x9318, it would be difficult to sustain an objection to the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s status.  With this in mind, and in light of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding authority under the plain text of the IRA to acquire tribal trust land, it is perfectly clear that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s land acquisition for the Narragansett was entirely proper.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the clear text of the IRA and historical pedigree of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s actions on behalf of the Narragansett, the majority holds that one word (\xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d) nestled in one clause in one of \xc2\xa7479\xe2\x80\x99s several definitions demonstrates that the Secretary acted outside his statutory authority in this case.  The consequences of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading are both curious and harsh: curious because it turns \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d into the most important word in the IRA, limiting not only some individuals\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility for federal benefits but also a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s; harsh because it would result in the unsupportable conclusion that, despite its 1983 administrative recognition, the Narragansett Tribe is not an Indian tribe under the IRA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s telling, when Congress granted the Secretary power to acquire trust land \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing land for <em>Indians</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7465 (emphasis added), it meant to permit land acquisitions for those persons whose tribal membership qualify them as \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by \xc2\xa7479.  In other words, the argument runs, the Secretary can acquire trust land for \xe2\x80\x9cpersons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7479.  This strained construction, advanced by petitioners, explains the majority\xe2\x80\x99s laser-like focus on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d: If the Narragansett Tribe was not recognized or under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s members do not belong to an Indian tribe \xe2\x80\x9cnow under Federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d and would therefore not be \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7465 by virtue of their tribal membership.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument works only if one reads \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d (in the phrase in \xc2\xa7465 \xe2\x80\x9cproviding land for Indians\xe2\x80\x9d) to refer to individuals, not an Indian tribe.  To petitioners, this reading is obvious; the alternative, they insist, would be \xe2\x80\x9cnonsensical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner State of Rhode Island 3.  This they argue despite the clear evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to provide the Secretary with the option of acquiring either tribal trusts or individual trusts in service of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding land for Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  And they ignore unambiguous evidence that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably in other parts of the IRA.  See \xc2\xa7475 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9cany claim or suit of any <em>Indian tribe</em> against the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in the first sentence and \xe2\x80\x9cany claim of such<em> Indians</em> against the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in the last sentence (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, this much must be admitted: Without the benefit of context, a reasonable person could conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d refers to multiple individuals who each qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d under the IRA.  An equally reasonable person could also conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d is meant to refer to a collective, namely, an Indian tribe.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he meaning\xe2\x80\x94or ambiguity\xe2\x80\x94of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 132 (2000), the proper course of action is to widen the interpretive lens and look to the rest of the statute for clarity.  Doing so would lead to \xc2\xa7465\xe2\x80\x99s last sentence, which specifies that the Secretary is to hold land in trust \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired.\xe2\x80\x9d  Put simply, in \xc2\xa7465 Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d to refer both to tribes and<em> </em>individuals.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority nevertheless dismisses this reading of the statute.  The Court notes that even if the Secretary has authority to take land into trust for a tribe, it must be an \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Indian</em> tribe,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xc2\xa7479\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d determining a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctribe,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority goes on to state, itself makes reference to \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the Court concludes, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here simply is no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \xe2\x80\x98Indian\xe2\x80\x99 in delineating the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa7479.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at<em> </em>13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority bypasses a straightforward explanation on its way to a circular one.  Requiring that a tribe be an \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe\xe2\x80\x9d does not demand immediate reference to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d; instead, it simply reflects the requirement that the tribe in question be formally recognized as an Indian tribe.  As explained above, the Secretary has limited benefits under federal Indian law\xe2\x80\x94including the acquisition of trust land\xe2\x80\x94to recognized tribes.  Recognition, then, is the central requirement for being considered an \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Act.  If a tribe satisfies the stringent criteria established by the Secretary to qualify for federal recognition, including the requirement that the tribe prove that it \xe2\x80\x9chas existed as a community from historical times until the present,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 CFR \xc2\xa783.7(b) (2008), it is <em>a fortiori</em> an \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Narragansett Tribe is no different.  In 1983, upon meeting the criteria for recognition, the Secretary gave notice that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Narragansett Indian Tribe \xe2\x80\xa6 exists as an <em>Indian tribe</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (emphasis added).  How the Narragansett could be an Indian tribe in 1983 and yet not be an Indian tribe today is a proposition the majority cannot explain.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s retort, that because \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cIndian,\xe2\x80\x9d the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d must control which groups can be considered a \xe2\x80\x9ctribe,\xe2\x80\x9d is entirely circular.  Yes, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctribe\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in part by reference to \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the word \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d is also defined in part by reference to \xe2\x80\x9cIndian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on one definition to provide content to the other is thus \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely circular and explains nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Darden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/318/index.html">503 U. S. 318</a>, 323 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governor of Rhode Island, for his part, adopts this circular logic and offers two examples of why reading the statute any other way would be implausible.  He first argues that if \xc2\xa7479\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d does not determine a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility, the Secretary would have authority to take land into trust \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of any group that he deems, at his whim and fancy, to be an \xe2\x80\x98Indian tribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner Carcieri 7.  The Governor caricatures the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  This Court has long made clear that Congress\xe2\x80\x94and therefore the Secretary\xe2\x80\x94lacks constitutional authority to \xe2\x80\x9cbring a community or body of people within [federal jurisdiction] by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/231/28/index.html">231 U. S. 28</a>, 46 (1913).  The Governor\xe2\x80\x99s next objection, that condoning the acquisition of trust land for the Narragansett Tribe would allow the Secretary to acquire land for an Indian tribe that lacks Indians, is equally unpersuasive.  As a general matter, to obtain federal recognition, a tribe must demonstrate that its \xe2\x80\x9cmembership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 CFR \xc2\xa783.7(e) (2008).  If the Governor suspects that the Narragansett is not an Indian tribe because it may lack members who are blood quantum Indians, he should have challenged the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to recognize the Tribe in 1983 when such an objection could have been properly received.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments\xe2\x80\x94and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion\xe2\x80\x94are based on a misreading of the statute.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]ow,\xe2\x80\x9d the temporal limitation in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian,\xe2\x80\x9d only affects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ability to qualify for federal benefits under the IRA.  If this case were about the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take land into trust for an individual who was incapable of proving her eligibility by lineage or blood quantum, I would have no trouble concluding that such an action was contrary to the IRA.  But that is not the case before us.  By taking land into trust for a validly recognized Indian tribe, the Secretary acted well within his statutory authority.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today adopts a cramped reading of a statute Congress intended to be \xe2\x80\x9csweeping\xe2\x80\x9d in scope.  <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Mancari</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/index.html">417 U.

Yet in matters of Indian law, the political branches have been entrusted to mark the proper boundaries between tribal and state jurisdiction.  See U. S. Const., Art.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa71724(d) (authorizing trust land for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe of Maine, and the Penobscot Tribe of Maine).  Other statutes, while identifying certain parcels the Secretary will take into trust for a tribe, do not purport to diminish the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s residual authority under \xc2\xa7465.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa71775c(a) (Mohegan Tribe); \xc2\xa71771d (Wampanoag Tribe); \xc2\xa71747(a) (Miccosukee Tribe).  Indeed, the Secretary has invoked his \xc2\xa7465 authority to take additional land into trust for the Miccosukee Tribe despite the existence of a statute authorizing and directing him to acquire certain land for the Tribe.  See Post-Argument En Banc Brief for National Congress of American Indians et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7 and App. 9 in No. 03\xe2\x80\x932647 (CA1).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority continues to insist, quite incorrectly, that Congress meant the term \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7465 to have the same meaning as the term \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7479.  That the text of the statute tells a different story appears to be an inconvenience the Court would rather ignore.   </p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Department of the Interior found \xe2\x80\x9ca high degree of retention of [Narragansett] family lines\xe2\x80\x9d between 1880 and 1980, and remarked that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he close intermarriage and stability of composition, plus the geographic stability of the group, reflect the maintenance of a socially distinct community.\xe2\x80\x9d  Recommendation for Acknowledgment 10.  It also noted that the Narragansett \xe2\x80\x9crequire applicants for full voting membership to trace their Narragansett Indian bloodlines back to the \xe2\x80\x98Detribalization Rolls of 1880\xe2\x80\x9384.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 16.  The record in this case does not tell us how many members of the Narragansett currently qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d by meeting the individual blood quantum requirement.  Indeed, it is possible that a significant number of the Narragansett are blood quantum Indians.  Accordingly, nothing the Court decides today prevents the Secretary from taking land into trust for those members of the Tribe who independently qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\xe2\x80\x9d under 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the record does not demonstrate how many members of the Narragansett qualify as blood quantum Indians, Justice Breyer nevertheless assumes that no member of the Tribe is a blood quantum Indian.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (concurring opinion).<em> </em>This assumption is misguided for two reasons.  To start, the record\xe2\x80\x99s silence on this matter is to be expected; the parties have consistently focused on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to take land into trust for the Tribe, not for individual members of the Tribe.  There is thus no legitimate basis for interpreting the lack of record evidence as affirmative proof that none of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s members are \xe2\x80\x9cIndian.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, neither the statute nor the relevant regulations mandate that a tribe have a threshold amount of blood quantum Indians as members in order to receive trust land.  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s unwarranted assumption about the Narragansett\xe2\x80\x99s membership, even if true, would therefore also be irrelevant to whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s actions were proper.  </p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p>\n\n Petitioners advance the additional argument that the Secretary lacks authority to take land into trust for the Narragansett because the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat. 813, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701 <em>et seq</em>., implicitly repealed the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7465 trust authority as applied to lands in Rhode Island.  This claim plainly fails.  While the Tribe agreed to subject the 1,800 acres it obtained in the Settlement Act to the State\xe2\x80\x99s civil and criminal laws, \xc2\xa71708(a), the 31-acre parcel of land at issue here was not part of the settlement lands.  And, critically, nothing in the text of the Settlement Act suggests that Con-\ngress intended to prevent the Secretary from acquiring additional parcels of land in Rhode Island that would be exempt from the State\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962813">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF SOUTER, J.<br/>\nCARCIERI V.

I have, however, a further reservation that puts me in the dissenting column.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disposition of the case turns on the construction of the language from 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7479, \xe2\x80\x9cany recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in the majority opinion forecloses the possibility that the two concepts, recognition and jurisdiction, may be given separate content.  As Justice Breyer makes clear in his concurrence, the statute imposes no time limit upon recognition, and in the past, the Department of the Interior has stated that the fact that the United States Government was ignorant of a tribe in 1934 does not preclude that tribe from having been under federal jurisdiction at that time.  See Memorandum from Associate Solicitor, Indian Affairs, to Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs, Request for Reconsideration of Decision Not to Take Land in Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe (Oct. 1, 1980), Lodging of Respondents 7.  And giving each phrase its own meaning would be consistent with established principles of statutory interpretation. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During oral argument, however, respondents explained that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s more recent interpretation of this statutory language had \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood recognition and under Federal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to be one and the same.\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.  Given the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s position, it is not surprising that neither he nor the Tribe raised a claim that the Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934: they simply failed to address an issue that no party understood to be present.  The error was shared equally all around, and there is no equitable demand that one side be penalized when both sides nodded.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can agree with Justice Breyer that the current record raises no particular reason to expect that the Tribe might be shown to have been under federal jurisdiction in 1934, but I would not stop there.  The very notion of jurisdiction as a distinct statutory condition was ignored in this litigation, and I know of no body of precedent or history of practice giving content to the condition sufficient for gauging the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s chances of satisfying it.  So I see no reason to deny the Secretary and the Narragansett Tribe an opportunity to advocate a construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d phrase that might favor their position here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore reverse and remand with opportunity for respondents to pursue a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d claim and respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s straight reversal.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Depending on the outcome of proceedings on remand, it might be necessary to address the second potential issue in this case, going to the significance of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 25 U.
