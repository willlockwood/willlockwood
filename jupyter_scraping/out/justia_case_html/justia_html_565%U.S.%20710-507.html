Employee Juan Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore platform, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore facility.  His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Act (LHWCA), \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7901 et\xc2\xa0seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries \xe2\x80\x9coccurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf, \n43 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71333(b).  The Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that \xc2\xa71333(b) did not cover Valladolid\xe2\x80\x99s fatal injury because his accident occurred on land, not on the OCS.  The Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s Benefits Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Rejecting tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA \xe2\x80\x9cmust establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employer\xe2\x80\x99s extractive operations on the OCS.

According to the Third Circuit, because Congress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, \xc2\xa71333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have occurred \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d operations on the OCS.  Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig, but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have been injured but for his traveling to the rig.  In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish \xe2\x80\x9ca bright-line geographic boundary,\xe2\x80\x9d extending \xc2\xa71333(b) coverage only to employees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.  Under its \xe2\x80\x9csitus-of-injury\xe2\x80\x9d test, a welder injured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligible for \xc2\xa71333(b) benefits.  In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit held that \xc2\xa71333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can establish a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d between their injury and extractive operations on the OCS.  The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpretation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both duration and nature.

The provision has only two requirements: The extractive operations must be \xe2\x80\x9cconducted on the [OCS],\xe2\x80\x9d and the employee\xe2\x80\x99s injury must occur \xe2\x80\x9cas the result of\xe2\x80\x9d those operations.  If, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of \xc2\xa71333(b) was to geographically limit the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from \xc2\xa71333(b) the words \xe2\x80\x9cas the result of operations conducted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but not in \xc2\xa71333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit \xc2\xa71333(b).  This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb\xe2\x80\x99s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 414\n, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207\n, neither of which held that \xc2\xa71333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS injuries.  Section 1333(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text also gives no indication that Congress intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits from LHWCA coverage.  To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits.

It is unlikely that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts.  In addition, under Pacific\xe2\x80\x99s alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the navigable waters above the shelf.  Thus, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a platform explosion would be excluded from \xc2\xa71333(b) coverage.  That view cannot be squared with \xc2\xa71333(b)\xe2\x80\x99s language.

The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA\xe2\x80\x99s text, because \xc2\xa71333(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coccurring as the result of operations\xe2\x80\x9d language plainly suggests causation.  And when taken to its logical conclusion, the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test, though nominally based on causation, is essentially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are doing at the time of injury.  Because LHWCA coverage was extended only to injuries \xe2\x80\x9coccurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71333(b)\xe2\x80\x99s focus should be on injuries resulting from those \xe2\x80\x9coperations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial-nexus\xe2\x80\x9d test is more faithful to \xc2\xa71333(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text.  This Court understands that test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employer\xe2\x80\x99s on-OCS extractive operations.  The test may not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has established the required significant causal link.  Whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the circumstances of each case.

My disagreement is limited to the last two substantive paragraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial-nexus\xe2\x80\x9d test for determining the scope of cover- age under \n43 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71333(b).  The Court indulges in con- siderable understatement when it acknowledges that this test \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be the easiest to administer,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14.  \xe2\x80\x9cSubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d is novel legalese with no established meaning in the present context.  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the parties\xe2\x80\x94which, though easier to apply, are unmoored from the text of \xc2\xa71333(b).  But if we must adopt an indeterminate standard (and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cas the result of\xe2\x80\x9d language leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to the devil of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s imagining.  I would hold that an employee may recover under \xc2\xa71333(b) if his injury was proximately caused by operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe term \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cshorthand for a concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise to legal liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5).  Life is too short to pursue every event to its most remote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for,\xe2\x80\x9d consequences, and the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough guide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of cause-and-effect.  See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, \n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258, \n287 (1992)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Thus, as the Court notes in rejecting the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d test for \xc2\xa71333(b) coverage, we have interpreted statutes with language similar to \xc2\xa71333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause standard.  See ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in tort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions, it can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation schemes like this one.  In Brown v. Gardner, \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, \n119 (1994)\n, we considered a no-fault veterans\xe2\x80\x99 compensation statute covering injuries that occurred \xe2\x80\x9cas the result of\xe2\x80\x9d medical treatment (precisely the language at issue here); we suggested that the requisite \xe2\x80\x9ccausal connection\xe2\x80\x9d between the injury and medical treatment may be \xe2\x80\x9climited to proximate causation so as to narrow the class of compensable cases .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by eliminating remote conse- quences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, some state workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation laws use the concept of proximate cause to determine entitlement.  See, e.g., Ex\xc2\xa0parte Patton, __ So. 3d __, __ (Ala. 2011); Marandino v. Prometheus Pharmacy, 294 Conn. 564, 591, 986 A.\xc2\xa02d 1023, 1041 (2010); Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.\xc2\xa0C. 196, 201, 641 S. E. 2d 869, 871 (2007).  Indeed, the statutory law of California, where Mr. Valladolid died while at work, limits workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation liability to cases \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal.

Judicial opinions do not provide a uniform formulation of the test, and borderline cases are rarely clear.

Unlike the substantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a \xe2\x80\x9cvocabulary\xe2\x80\x9d for answering questions like the one raised by the facts of this case.  It may be productive, for example, to consider whether the injury was \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of the risk\xe2\x80\x9d created by OCS operations, or whether some \xe2\x80\x9csuperseding or intervening cause\xe2\x80\x9d exists.

Brady, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 274, \n279 (1977)\n: We sustain state taxes against Commerce Clause challenges if they are, inter alia, \xe2\x80\x9capplied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v.

That clarification\xe2\x80\x94and any further clarification in the Commerce Clause context\xe2\x80\x94will not be remotely helpful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-nexus test in the very different legal context of workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation under \xc2\xa71333(b).

Like the word \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d itself, the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d in our state-tax cases does not require any causal relationship whatsoever.

In the opinion below, moreover, the Ninth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1989 case law, which required \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0that the claimant show a nexus .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  604 F.\xc2\xa03d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting Mills v. Director, Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs, 846 F.\xc2\xa02d 1013, 1015 (CA5 1988), rev\xe2\x80\x99d en banc, 877 F.\xc2\xa02d 356 (1989)).  Who knows whether this is a tertium quid or not?  The Court has given us a new test whose contours are entirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for it except that it will add complexity to the law and litigation to the courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a peculiarity) that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion creates: The statutory text at issue requires compensation for \xe2\x80\x9cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71333(b) (emphasis added).  Before today, I would have thought it clear that courts must apply proximate-cause analysis to the \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d provision; but that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds today) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neighboring \xe2\x80\x9coccurring as the result of\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  Surely both phrases express the same concept.  What a tangled web we weave.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would affirm the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to remand the case to the Benefits Review Board, but with instructions to apply a proximate-cause test.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Strange to say, the California Supreme Court has held that this unmistakable term-of-art reference to a rule found in the common law of torts does not establish a rule \xe2\x80\x9cidentical to that found in the common law of torts,\xe2\x80\x9d but merely \xe2\x80\x9celaborat[es] the general requirement that the injury arise out of the employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  LaTourette v.
