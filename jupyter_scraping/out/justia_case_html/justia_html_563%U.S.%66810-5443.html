Fowler was convicted of violating the federal witness tampering statute, which makes it a crime \xe2\x80\x9cto kill another person, with intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 prevent the communication by any person to a [Federal] law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relating to the \xe2\x80\xa6 possible commission of a Federal offense,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).  Rejecting Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had killed the officer intending to prevent him from communicating with a <em>federal </em>officer, the Eleventh Circuit held that a showing of a possible or potential communication to federal authorities was sufficient.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>In such circumstances, the Government must establish a \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) violation by showing there was a reasonable likelihood<em> </em>that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer.

Thus, the Government must prove (1) a killing, (2) committed with a particular intent, namely, an intent (a) to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication\xe2\x80\x9d (b) about \xe2\x80\x9cthe commission or possible commission of a Federal offense\xe2\x80\x9d (c) to a federal \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  P. 3. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Nothing in \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s language limits it to instances in which the defendant has some identifiable law enforcement officers particularly in mind.  Any such limitation would conflict with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose.  Witness tampering may prove more serious (and more effective) when the crime takes place before the victim has engaged in any communication at all with officers\xe2\x80\x94at a time when the precise communication and nature of the officer who may receive it are not yet known.  Hence, the statute covers a defendant, like petitioner, who kills with intent to prevent communication with any and all officers.  The Court must consequently decide what, if anything, the Government must show about the likelihood of a hypothetical communication with a federal officer where the defendant did not think specifically about any particular communication or its recipient.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0To determine what the Government must prove in such instances, the Court looks to the dictionary definition of the statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cprevent,\xe2\x80\x9d which means rendering an \xe2\x80\x9cintended,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d or<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d event impractical or impossible by anticipatory action.  No one suggests that the word \xe2\x80\x9cintended\xe2\x80\x9d sets forth the appropriate standard here.  The Government and the Eleventh Circuit would rest their standard on the word \xe2\x80\x9cpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that standard would eliminate the independent force of the statutory \xe2\x80\x9cfederal officer\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, and would extend the statute beyond its intended, basically federal, scope.  Fashioning a standard based on the word \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and objectives.  Thus, where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent includes an intent to prevent communications with <em>federal</em> officers only if there is a reasonable likelihood under the circumstances that, in the absence of the killing, at least one of the relevant communications would have been made to a federal officer.  The Government need not show that such a communication, had it occurred, would have been federal beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even that it is more likely than not.  But it must show that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or hypothetical.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).  We focus on instances where a defendant killed a person with an intent to prevent that person from communicating with law enforcement officers in general but where the defendant did not have federal law enforcement officers (or any specific individuals) particularly in mind.  The question before us concerns what, if anything, the Government must show beyond this broad in-definite intent in order to show that the defendant more particularly intended to prevent communication with <em>federal</em> officers as well.  We hold that, in such circumstances, the Government must show that there was a <em>reasonable likelihood </em>that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the early morning hours of March 3, 1998, Charles Fowler and several other men prepared to rob a Florida bank.  They met in a cemetery, put on black clothes and gloves, began to drink and use drugs, and discussed the proposed crime.  Shortly before daybreak a local police officer, Todd Horner, came upon the group.  He pulled out his gun and asked the men to identify themselves.  Fowler and some of the others managed to overcome Horner and take his gun.  After Horner spoke to one of the men by name, Fowler said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can\xe2\x80\x99t walk away from this thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 38 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And he shot and killed Horner.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal authorities charged Fowler with violating the federal witness tampering statute.  He was convicted.  On appeal, Fowler argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had killed Horner intending to prevent Horner from communicating with a <em>federal </em>officer.  The Eleventh Circuit disagreed.  It held that a showing of a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>possible </em>or <em>potential </em>communication to federal authorities\xe2\x80\x9d was sufficient.  603 F.\xc2\xa03d 883, 888 (2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fowler sought certiorari.  And because the Circuits have disagreed about this last-mentioned matter, we granted Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.

This kind of circumstance is not necessarily rare, as the facts here illustrate.  Fowler (we here assume) was not thinking specifically about federal officers, but he would nonetheless have wanted to prevent communication with federal officers from taking place (had he considered the matter).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the defendant has in mind a particular individual or a particular set of individuals with whom he fears the victim might communicate, the application of the statute is relatively clear.  For instance, if a defendant kills a victim with the intent of preventing the victim from communicating with a particular individual, say John Smith, who the defendant knows is a federal law enforcement officer, the statute fits like a glove.  If a defendant kills a victim with the intent of preventing the victim from communicating with Sam Smith, who is in fact (but who the defendant does not know is) a federal law enforcement officer, the statute still fits, for it specifically says that \xe2\x80\x9cno state of mind need be proved\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to this last-mentioned circumstance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the statutory language, however, limits it to these kinds of instances, instances in which the defendant has some law enforcement officer or set of officers, or other identifiable individuals, particularly in mind.  Moreover, any such limitation would conflict with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose.  Witness tampering may prove more serious (and more effective) when the crime takes place before the victim has engaged in any communication at all with law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x94at a time when the precise communication and nature of the officer who may receive it are not yet known.  Cf.,<em> e.g.</em>, S. Rep. No. 97\xe2\x80\x93532, pp.\xc2\xa014, 15 (1982) (statute applies \xe2\x80\x9cto offenses against witnesses, victims, or informants which occur before the witness testifies or the informant communicates with law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 19 (witness \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntimidation offenses are particularly insidious and do violence to traditional notions of justice because no one can be convicted of a crime which is not reported.  [Section 1512] reaches intimidation offenses committed before a crime is reported to the appropriate authorities\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence the statute covers a defendant who kills with intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally (<em>i.e.,</em> with any and all law enforcement officers).  And we must consequently decide what, if anything, the Government must show about the likelihood of a hypothetical communication with a federal law enforcement officer in circumstances where the defendant did not think specifically about any particular communication or its recipient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these circumstances, the application of the statute is not as simple.  We cannot determine whether the individual the defendant had in mind is in fact a federal officer, because the defendant did not have a particular individual in mind.  And we cannot insist that the defendant have had some general thought about federal officers in mind because the statute says that \xe2\x80\x9cno state of mind need be proved\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to the federal nature of the communication\xe2\x80\x99s recipient.  \xc2\xa71512(g)(2).  What, then, must the Government show to prove that such a defendant intended to prevent communications to federal officers?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with two basic propositions.  First, in our view, the Government need not show <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> (or even that it is <em>more likely than not</em>) that the hypothetical communication would have been to a federal officer.  No Circuit has adopted this interpretation, and no party argues for it here.  But see <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  And for good reason: The relevant question concerns the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  The Government will already have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the relevant broad indefinite intent, namely, the intent to prevent the victim from communicating with (unspecified) law enforcement officers.  And one can possess an intent (<em>i.e.,</em> one can act in order to bring about a certain state of affairs) even if there is considerable doubt whether the event that the intent contemplates will in fact occur.  One can, for example, put up shutters with the intent of protecting the furniture from hurricane damage even if there is considerable doubt that any hurricane will actually occur.  One can drive to Fenway Park with the intent of seeing the Red Sox play that afternoon even if a mistake about the date means the stadium is empty.  One can blow up a bridge with the intent of stopping an advancing army, even if the army advances regardless, along a different route.  And, similarly, a defendant can kill a victim with <em>an intent</em> to\nprevent the victim from communicating with federal law enforcement officers even if there is some considerable doubt that any such communication would otherwise have taken place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, second, the Government must show more than\nthe broad indefinite intent we have described, the intent to prevent communications to law enforcement officers in general.  That is so for two separate reasons.  For one thing, the statute speaks of an \xe2\x80\x9cintent to <em>prevent\xe2\x80\x9d </em>something. <em> </em>But (apart from mistakes, as in our Red Sox example) one cannot act with an \xe2\x80\x9cintent to <em>prevent</em>\xe2\x80\x9d something that could not possibly have taken place regardless.  We can speak of a Colorado trout fisherman who tries to prevent his trout stream from being invaded by pike or carp, but in ordinary circumstances we cannot speak about trying to <em>prevent </em>the stream\xe2\x80\x99s invasion by whales.  Indeed, the dictionary defines \xe2\x80\x9cprevent\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto render (an <em>intended, possible, or likely</em> action or event) impractical\nor impossible by anticipatory action.\xe2\x80\x9d  OED Online (Mar. 2011) (emphasis added), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151073?rskey=QWN6QB&amp;result=2&amp;=false (all Internet materials as visited May 23, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, to allow the Government to show no more than the broad indefinite intent we have described (the intent to prevent communications to law enforcement officers in general) would bring within the scope of this statute many instances of witness tampering in purely state investigations and proceedings, thus extending the scope of this federal statute well beyond the primarily federal area that Congress had in mind.  See <em>infra</em>, at<em> </em>8\xe2\x80\x939<em>.  </em>For both these reasons, unlike the dissent, we cannot read the statute as intending to excuse the Government from proving <em>something </em>about the hypothetical communication with federal officers.  The question remains, what is that something?</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find possible answers to this question in the dictionary definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprevent.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have said, that word applies where a defendant, by \xe2\x80\x9canticipatory action,\xe2\x80\x9d (here, killing a victim) intended \xe2\x80\x9cto render \xe2\x80\xa6 impractical or impossible\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9caction or event\xe2\x80\x9d (here, the victim\xe2\x80\x99s communication with a federal law enforcement officer) which (1) was<em> \xe2\x80\x9cintended</em>,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d </em>(2) was<em> \xe2\x80\x9cpossible</em>,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d </em>or<em> </em>(3) was<em> \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d</em> to have otherwise occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one suggests that the first word, the word \xe2\x80\x9cintended,\xe2\x80\x9d sets forth the appropriate standard.  That word in this context refers to the <em>victim\xe2\x80\x99s </em>intent.  That intent is often difficult to discern.  Moreover, to require the Government to prove it would prevent the statute from applying where it is plain that federal officers would have\nbeen involved in investigating and prosecuting the offense (for instance, robbing the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox), but where the defendant killed the victim before the victim had decided to communicate to law enforcement officers.  Congress, however, intended the statute to apply in these last-mentioned circumstances.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government (and the Eleventh Circuit) would rest their standard on the second word, the word \xe2\x80\x9cpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States 10 (standard is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it was reasonably possible that at least one of the communications that the murder \xe2\x80\xa6 was intended to prevent would have been with a federal law enforcement official\xe2\x80\x9d); 603 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 888 (requiring showing of a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>possible</em> or <em>potential</em> communication to federal authorities\xe2\x80\x9d).  But, in our view, that standard is difficult to reconcile with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language and its intended, basically federal, scope. Cf. <em>supra, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Often, when a defendant acts in ways that violate state criminal law, some or all of those acts will violate federal criminal law as well.  And where a federal crime is at issue, communication with federal law enforcement officers is almost always a <em>possibility.  </em>Thus, to allow the Government to show only a mere possibility that a communication would have been with federal officials is to permit the Government to show little more than the possible commission of a federal offense.  (That is to say, the latter showing by itself would almost automatically show the statutorily necessary connection with a <em>federal </em>law enforcement officer.)  The \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard would thereby weaken or eliminate the independent force of the separate statutory requirement that the defendant, in killing the victim, must intend to prevent communication with one who is \xe2\x80\x9ca law enforcement officer or judge <em>of\nthe United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added); see \xc2\xa71515(a)(4) (defining \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can officer or employee <em>of the Federal Government</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Cf. <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001) (normally we must give effect \xe2\x80\x9cto every clause and word of a statute\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted));<em> Ratzlaf</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/135/index.html">510 U.

We consequently hold that (in a case such as this one where the defendant does not have particular federal law enforcement officers in mind) the Government must show <em>a reasonable likelihood</em> that, had, <em>e.g</em>., the victim communicated with law enforcement officers, at least one relevant communication would have been made to a federal law enforcement officer.  That is to say, where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent includes an intent to prevent communications with <em>federal</em> law enforcement officers only if it is reasonably likely under the circumstances that (in the absence of the killing) at least one of the relevant communications would have been made to a federal officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government need not show that such a communication, had it occurred, would have been federal beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even that it is more likely than not.  For, as we have said, one can act with an intent to prevent an event from occurring without it being true beyond a reasonable doubt (or even more likely than not) that the event would otherwise occur.  (Recall the homeowner who closes his shutters in order to prevent damage from a hurricane that may not happen.  <em>Supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936<em>.</em>)  But the Government must show that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote, outlandish, or simply hypothetical.  Jones, who kills Smith to prevent his communicating with law enforcement officers in general, does not kill Smith to prevent his communicating with Lithuanian law enforcement officers, for there is no reasonable likelihood that any Lithuanian officers would become involved.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fowler argues that the evidence in this case is insuf-ficient to satisfy a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).  In my view, the Government must prove that the defendant intended to prevent a communication which, had it been made, would beyond a reasonable doubt have been made <em>to a federal law enforcement officer</em>.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s vague \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard has no basis in the statutory text and will serve only to confuse judges and juries.  Accordingly, although I agree the case should be remanded for the Eleventh Circuit to consider whether the objection to sufficiency of the evidence was preserved or whether the District Court committed plain error, I would hold that there was insufficient evidence to support Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1512(a)(1)(C) of Title 18 makes it a federal crime \xe2\x80\x9cto kill another person, with intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Viewed in isolation, this provision contains an ambiguity:  Does the <em>mens rea </em>of the statute include a specific intent to prevent communication to a law enforcement officer <em>of the United States;</em> or is it satisfied by the mere intent to prevent communication to a law enforcement officer <em>who happens to be </em>a law enforcement officer of the United States?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Happily, a different statutory provision resolves this ambiguity.  It states that \xe2\x80\x9cno state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71512(g)(2).  This makes clear that the first possibility is wrong, and the second right.  But removing the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal officer\xe2\x80\x9d requirement as an element of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em> does not remove it as an element of the <em>actus reus</em>\xe2\x80\x94that is, as an element of the facts that must be proved for conviction.  It must be proved, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that the communication intended to be prevented was communication to a federal officer.  Thus, if a suspect in an investigation murders an informant to prevent him from talking to authorities, but is unaware that the informant was working for the FBI, the suspect would be guilty: He would have committed a murder with the intention of preventing the informant\xe2\x80\x99s communication to authorities about his criminal activities, and the communication he sought to prevent would necessarily have been to federal law enforcement.  Likewise, a suspect would be guilty if he committed a murder to prevent a witness from informing law enforcement that he lied on his federal income tax return:  He sought to prevent a communication that would have been made to federal officials, because they alone prosecute federal tax violations.  But a suspect who commits a murder with the general intent of preventing law enforcement from learning about activities that violate both state and federal \nlaw would not be guilty, because the Government would \nbe unable to prove that the communication he sought to prevent necessarily would have been to a federal official.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that standard, this is an easy case.  There was evidence that Fowler murdered Officer Horner in order \nto prevent him from communicating information about Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s criminal activities. But the only evidence proffered by the Government to establish that the communication would have been to a federal law enforcement agent was the fact that a different state police officer, four years later, contacted federal law enforcement about a robbery by Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s confederate\xe2\x80\x94and that only because the state-law statute of limitations for the robbery had expired.  That is not nearly enough to demonstrate Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court gives the statute a broader reading than the one I ascribe.  The Government can obtain a conviction, it says, so long as it can prove a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the communication would have been made to a federal \nlaw enforcement officer.  I know of no precedent for using a \xe2\x80\x9clikelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard rather than the \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a rea-sonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d standard for a finding of fact essential \nto a criminal conviction; and the justifications the Court presents for that course in the present case are not \nconvincing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court maintains that the Government need not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the communication would have been to a federal officer because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he relevant question concerns the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  But that reasoning is directly contrary to \xc2\xa71512(g)(2), which expressly states that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent is <em>not</em> the relevant question with respect to the federal character of law enforcement officer meant to be deprived of the information.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant can kill a victim with <em>an intent</em> to prevent the victim from communicating with federal law enforcement officers even if there is some considerable doubt that any such communication would otherwise have taken place,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, is completely irrelevant to the question presented.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also proclaims that a narrower view \xe2\x80\x9cwould conflict with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d which is to prevent witness tampering \xe2\x80\x9cat a time when the precise communication and nature of the officer who may receive it are not yet known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  It cites no basis for attributing that purpose, and there is none\xe2\x80\x94other than the fact that it supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.  Another purpose is just as likely\xe2\x80\x94and indeed more likely, since it can be achieved without abandonment of the ancient rule that in criminal prosecutions facts must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.  Murder, after all, is a crime, and often a capital crime, under all state laws.  There is no reason to ascribe to Congress the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of transferring murder prosecutions that would ordinarily be brought in state court to federal court based on only a tangential federal interest.  Congress was concerned with preserving the integrity and effectiveness of <em>federal </em>prosecutions, and where they are not clearly involved (as the ordinary beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard would require) a federal murder prosecution has no proper place.  Limited as I have suggested, the federal law would still have ample scope, reaching what were surely the principal cases Congress had in mind\xe2\x80\x94the killing of prospective witnesses in federal trials or in ongoing federal investigations.  Here, as would be the case in many situations involving a merely hypothetical link to a federal investigation, Fowler murdered a state police officer.  The natural place to have prosecuted him would have been state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is even less persuasive in light of the rule of lenity, under which we must construe ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of the defendant.  Here, the Court adopts a kind of rule of harshness, discarding the most straightforward construction of the text in favor of textually implausible one, based on vague intuitions about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion never cites the rule of lenity, probably because it cannot honestly say that the statute is so clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burgess</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/124/index.html">553 U. S. 124</a>, 136 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To make matters worse, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard is hopelessly indeterminate.  The Government must show that a communication to a federal officer is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably likely,\xe2\x80\x9d which is less likely than \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not,\xe2\x80\x9d but more likely than \xe2\x80\x9creasonably possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  I doubt that any jury can grasp the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cyou must find that a communication to a federal officer was reasonably likely\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyou must find that a communication to a federal officer was reasonably possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Understandably, the Court refuses to give any examples of what \xe2\x80\x9creasonably likely\xe2\x80\x9d means, except for an absurd example involving communications with Lithuanian police officers, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x94which obviously would not be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably possible\xe2\x80\x9d either.  Indeed, the Court refuses to apply its standard to the facts of this case, leaving that precarious task to the lower court.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent adopts a view of the statute that is even broader than the Government\xe2\x80\x99s.  It effectively contends that the Government need not prove <em>anything</em> with respect to the fact that the communication sought to be prevented was \xe2\x80\x9cto a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  As long as the Government can prove that the defendant sought to prevent the communication of information about a federal crime (including a federal crime that is also a state crime) it will necessarily have proved that the \xe2\x80\x9cset of law enforcement officers (whose identities were unknown to him)\xe2\x80\x9d he had in mind \xe2\x80\x9cincluded law enforcement officers who were employed by the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 3 (opinion of Alito, J.).  Conviction requires neither any specific intent regarding the federal status of the officer, nor even any likelihood that a communication to a federal officer would have occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal defect in this interpretation is that it makes the words \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  Section 1512(a)(1)(C) specifically requires that the in-formation the defendant seeks to prevent from being com-municated be \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d requires nothing more than this it is utterly without effect.  The implication of this view is that Congress enacted \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ca law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d only to immediately nullify it by \xc2\xa71512(g)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno state of mind\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  Not likely\xe2\x80\x94and not sound statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent claims that my analysis \xe2\x80\x9cconfuses what the prosecution must prove with what a rational jury may choose to infer in a particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  I find this contention difficult to understand.  In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, a properly instructed jury should be required to find <em>neither</em> that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em> had any connection to a federal officer, <em>nor</em> that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>actus reus</em> had any connection to a federal officer.  It therefore follows that under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, a properly instructed jury should be required to find nothing about a connection to a federal officer beyond the fact that the information related to a federal offense, which means that, unless the jury is acting irrationally or is engaging in jury nullification, the \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d provision is indeed superfluous.  The dissent is correct that the proof of one element of a crime (such as an overt act) can sometimes be used to prove that a different element (such as a conspiratorial agreement) is satisfied, <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa02; but in such cases, the jury is instructed that it is required to make a separate finding to convict (<em>e.g.,</em> that a conspiratorial agreement actually occurred).  Here, the dissent identifies no separate finding the jury must make beyond the fact of a federal offense.  The dissent also observes that when a defendant murders a federal officer to prevent him from communicating information about a nonfederal crime, he does not violate the statute.  <em>Post</em>, at 7.  This observation convincingly establishes that the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cFederal offense\xe2\x80\x9d are not superfluous under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, an observation irrelevant to my point that the dissent makes the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent contends that my interpretation \xe2\x80\x9chas no grounding in the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  It asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe text of the statute makes it perfectly clear that the federal officer requirement is exclusively an element of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Perhaps the only thing \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly clear\xe2\x80\x9d about this statute is that it states the precise opposite of that proposition: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71512(g)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would federalize crimes that have no connection to any federal investigation.  A person caught by a state police officer with marijuana who murders the state police officer to cover it up could be prosecuted in federal court.  That would approach the outer limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers.  We have adopted a federalism principle that applies when a statute would render \xe2\x80\x9ctraditionally local criminal conduct \xe2\x80\xa6 a matter for federal enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d:  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance in the prosecution of crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/848/index.html">529 U. S. 848</a>, 858 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, the dissent adds to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crule of harshness\xe2\x80\x9d a rule of antifederalism, under which a court must actually ignore a federal connection that Congress prescribed so as to avoid intrusion into traditionally local law enforcement.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Government did not establish that Fowler intended to prevent a communication that, if made, would have been made to a federal law enforcement officer, there was insufficient evidence to convict him of violating \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).  Since there remains, however, the question whether Fowler preserved this issue at trial or whether the inadequacy of the evidence constituted plain error, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s order vacating the judgment and remanding for resolution of that question.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963554">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nFOWLER V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).  Instead of heeding\nthe statutory text, the Court has effectively amended the statute by adding a new element.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) makes it a federal crime \xe2\x80\x9cto kill another person, with intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Also important for present purposes is \xc2\xa71512(g)(2), which provides, among other things, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a prosecution for an offense under this section, no state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance \xe2\x80\xa6 that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Putting these two provisions together, what had to be shown in the present case was as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\n(1) Fowler killed Officer Horner,</p>\n<p>\n\n(2) with the intent to prevent any person (<em>i.e.</em>, either Officer Horner or someone else) from communicating,</p>\n<p>\n\n(3) to a person who (whether or not known as such to Fowler) was a federal law enforcement officer,</p>\n<p>\n\n(4) information concerning the possible commission of a federal crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether there was sufficient evidence to support Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, and thus we must ask whether any rational jury could find that all of the elements noted above were adequately established.  See <em>United States </em>v.<em> Powell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/57/index.html">469 U. S. 57</a>, 67 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There can be no dispute that there was sufficient evidence to establish elements (1), (2), and (4).  That is, there was ample evidence to show (1) that Fowler killed Officer Horner, (2) that he did so with the intent to prevent the communication of information about what Officer Horner had seen, and (4) that this information concerned the possible commission of at least one federal crime\xe2\x80\x94for example, conspiracy to rob a bank in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7371, 2113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the only remaining question is whether there was enough evidence to permit a rational jury to infer that element (3) had been satisfied.  And in connection with this question, it is important to keep in mind three things that element (3) <em>does not</em> require.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, element (3) does not demand proof that Officer Horner, had he not been killed, would have reported\xe2\x80\x94or even might have reported\xe2\x80\x94what he saw to anyone, much less to a federal officer.  Element (3) is solely concerned with a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, while element (3) requires proof that Fowler intended to prevent <em>some </em>law enforcement officer from learning what Officer Horner had seen, element (3) does not require proof that Fowler had any particular law enforcement officer in mind.  Section 1512(a)(1)(C) simply demands that the recipient of the information be \xe2\x80\x9ca law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, it would be enough if Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s intent was to prevent Officer Horner\xe2\x80\x99s information from reaching <em>any</em> federal law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, element (3) does not demand proof that Fowler <em>knew</em> that the generic officer noted above was a federal,\nas opposed to a state or local, law enforcement officer.  Sec-tion 1512(g)(2) specifically rules out any such requirement.  It is enough that our generic officer <em>was in fact</em> a federal officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the meaning of element (3) is understood, it is clear that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case must be affirmed.  A rational jury could infer that Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s intent was to prevent information about what Officer Horner had seen from reaching any person who could bring about his arrest and conviction.  In other words, a rational jury could infer that Fowler, in effect, had in mind a set of law enforcement officers (whose identities were unknown to him) who could set in motion a chain of events that would land him in prison.  And since the information that Officer Horner possessed related to, among other things, the possible commission of a federal crime, a rational jury could infer that this group included law enforcement officers who were employed by the United States.  The question presented in this case is as simple as that.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court begins on the right track, observing that the \xe2\x80\x9crelevant question concerns the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent\xe2\x80\x9d and that therefore \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government need not show <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> (or even that it is <em>more likely than not</em>) that the hypothetical communication would have been to a federal officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (emphasis in original).  But the Court veers off course when it goes on to hold that the prosecution was required to show that, if Officer Horner had not been killed, there was a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>reasonable likelihood</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that his information would have reached a federal officer.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches this conclusion based on the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprevent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  The Court starts with the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9capart from mistakes \xe2\x80\xa6 one cannot act with an \xe2\x80\x98intent to <em>prevent</em>\xe2\x80\x99 something that could not possibly have taken place regardless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (emphasis in original).  I understand this to mean that a rational person will not take action to prevent something that the person knows is not possible.  This is true, but it does not follow that a rational person will not take action to prevent an undesirable event unless the event is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably likely.\xe2\x80\x9d  Risk-averse people do this all the time.  They refrain from flying to avoid dying in a plane crash.  They shun rooms on the upper floors of hotels to prevent being trapped in the event of a fire.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What matters under \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) is not the likelihood that information about a possible federal crime will be conveyed to a federal officer.  What matters is the intent\nof the person who kills or attempts to kill in order to prevent that information from reaching such an officer.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d test has no basis in the text of \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s test also makes little sense.  Under this test, the application of \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) depends on a witness-killer\xe2\x80\x99s toleration of risk.  According to the Court, \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) does not reach a killer who has so little regard for human life that he or she is willing to murder in order to prevent even a remote possibility that a witness will inform the authorities.  It is hard to imagine why Congress would have wanted to draw this line.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) also has no grounding in the language of the statute.  He makes the fundamental mistake of confusing \xc2\xa71512(a)\n(1)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em> and <em>actus reus</em> elements.  Justice Scalia states that what he terms \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98federal officer\xe2\x80\x99 \nrequirement\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9can element of the <em>actus reus</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment), but the text of the\nstatute makes it perfectly clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98federal officer\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d is exclusively an element of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)(1)  Whoever kills or attempts to kill another person, <em>with intent to\xe2\x80\x94</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(C)\xe2\x80\x82prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense or a violation of conditions of probation, parole, or release pending judicial proceedings;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall be punished as provided in paragraph (3).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The actus reus</em> of this provision is set out in its first eight words (\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever kills or attempts to kill another person\xe2\x80\x9d).

Section 1512(g)(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn a prosecution for an offense under [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512], no state of mind need be proved with re-\nspect to the circumstance \xe2\x80\xa6 that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal\nGovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What this clearly means, as the Court recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 4, is simply that a defendant need not intend to prevent a qualifying communication from reaching an officer <em>whom the defendant knows to be a federal, as opposed to a state or local law enforcement officer</em>.  But nothing in this provision adds to the <em>actus reus </em>elements in \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s principal criticism of my interpretation of the statute is that \xe2\x80\x9cit makes the words \xe2\x80\x98of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He incorrectly states that under my interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government need not prove <em>anything</em> with respect to the fact that the communication sought to be prevented was \xe2\x80\x98to a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s long as the Government can prove that the defendant sought to prevent the communication of information about a federal crime (including a federal crime that is also a state crime) it will necessarily have proved that [the set of officers whom the defendant had in mind] \xe2\x80\x98included law enforcement officers who were employed by the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (emphasis in original).  This description of my interpretation confuses what the prosecution must prove with what a rational jury may choose to infer in a particular case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to violate \xc2\xa71512(a)(1)(C), a defendant must have an intent regarding two things: first, the substance of the communication that the defendant wishes to prevent (information concerning, among other things, the commission or possible commission of a federal crime) and, second, the recipient of the communication (a law enforcement officer or judge who turns out to be a federal officer or judge).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that evidence regarding the federal character of an offense may lead a rational jury to infer that the officers whom the defendant had in mind included federal officers.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But those two elements remain distinct; both must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and it is entirely possible for a defendant to satisfy one without also satisfying the other.  For example, if a uniformed federal officer came upon a defendant during the commission of a purely state offense (for example, a murder, assault, or rape not committed in a federal enclave), the defendant might kill or attempt to kill the officer to prevent the officer from radioing in that information to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s superiors.  This defendant would have the intent to prevent a communication to a federal officer, but there would be no violation of the statute because the information would not concern a federal crime.  Thus, contrary to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, under my interpretation,\nthe two intent elements\xe2\x80\x94relating to the substance of the feared communication and the identity of the feared recipient\xe2\x80\x94are not redundant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia invokes a rule that disfavors the interpretation of a federal criminal statute in a way that\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significantly change[s] the federal-state balance in the prosecution of crimes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (quoting <em>Jones </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/848/index.html">529 U.
