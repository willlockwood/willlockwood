Because he had been convicted of the same offense three times before, he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maximum 4-year prison term.  The prosecutor sent Frye\xe2\x80\x99s counsel a letter, offering two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90-day sentence.  Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they expired.  Less than a week before Frye\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary hearing, he was again arrested for driving with a revoked license.  He subsequently pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced to three years in prison.  Seeking postconviction relief in state court, he alleged his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testified that he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of the offer.  The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a \n \nSixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668\n.  Specifically, the court found that defense counsel had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and concluded that Frye had shown that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld: \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The \n \nSixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.  That right applies to \xe2\x80\x9call \xe2\x80\x98critical\xe2\x80\x99 stages of the criminal proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Montejo v. Louisiana, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 778\n.  Hill v. Lockhart, \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52\n, established that Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s two-part test governs ineffective-assistance claims in the plea bargain context.  There, the defendant had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about his plea, but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial had he received the proper advice.  474 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 60.  In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, where a plea offer was set aside because counsel had misinformed the defendant of its immigration consequences, this Court made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical\xe2\x80\x9d stage for ineffective-assistance purposes, id., at ___, and rejected the argument made by the State in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors.  The State attempts to distinguish Hill and Padilla from the instant case.  It notes that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present, while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected; and it insists that there is no right to receive a plea offer in any event.  Thus, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequacies when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved.  While these contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, they do not suffice to overcome the simple reality that 97 percent of federal convictions and 94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.  Plea bargains have become so central to today\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the \n \nSixth Amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal process.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t2.\xc2\xa0As a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.  Any exceptions to this rule need not be addressed here, for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.  Standards for prompt communication and consultation recommended by the American Bar Association and adopted by numerous state and federal courts, though not determinative, serve as important guides.  The prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated claims.  First, a formal offer\xe2\x80\x99s terms and processing can be documented.  Second, States may require that all offers be in writing.  Third, formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before the later proceedings commence.  Here, as the result of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance, the offers lapsed.  Under Strickland, the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the breach of duty.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t3.\xc2\xa0To show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance, defendants must demonstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted the more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s canceling it or the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.  This application of Strickland to uncommunicated, lapsed pleas does not alter Hill\xe2\x80\x99s standard, which requires a defendant complaining that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of going to trial to show \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59.  Hill correctly applies in the context in which it arose, but it does not provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance during plea negotiations.  Because Frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to entering an open plea, Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer.  He must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented.  This further showing is particularly important because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford v. Bursey, \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545\n, nor a federal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New York, \n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 257\n.  Missouri, among other States, appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a plea agreement; and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, some state rules, including Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements.

These matters should be addressed by the Missouri appellate court in the first instance.  Given that Frye\xe2\x80\x99s new offense for driving without a license occurred a week before his preliminary hearing, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were required by state law to do so.

The right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.  See Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, \n686 (1984)\n.  This case arises in the context of claimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a prosecution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered terms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea entered later.  The initial question is whether the consti- tutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.  If there is a right to effective assistance with respect to those offers, a further question is what a defendant must dem- onstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance.  Other questions relating to ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers, including the question of proper remedies, are considered in a second case decided today.  See Lafler v. Cooper, post, at 3\xe2\x80\x9316.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license.  Frye had been convicted for that offense on three other occasions, so the State of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.  See Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7302.321.2, 558.011.1(4) (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye\xe2\x80\x99s counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains.  App.\xc2\xa050.  The prosecutor first offered to recommend a 3-year sentence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, without a recommendation regarding probation but with a recommendation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as so-called \xe2\x80\x9cshock\xe2\x80\x9d time.  The second offer was to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it, to recommend a 90-day sentence.  The misdemeanor charge of driving with a revoked license carries a maximum term of imprisonment of one year.  311 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 350, 360 (Mo. App. 2010).  The letter stated both offers would expire on December 28.  Frye\xe2\x80\x99s attorney did not advise Frye that the offers had been made.  The offers expired.  Id., at 356.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFrye\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4, 2008.

At the January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007 arrest.  He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraignment but then changed his plea to guilty.  There was no underlying plea agreement.  App. 5, 13, 16.  The state trial court accepted Frye\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.  Id., at 21.

It determined that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a \n \nSixth Amendment violation under Strickland.  First, the court determined Frye\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient because the \xe2\x80\x9crecord is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.\xe2\x80\x9d  311 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 355, 356 (emphasis deleted).  The court next concluded Frye had shown his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance caused him prejudice because \xe2\x80\x9cFrye pled guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a maximum sentence of four years instead of one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 360.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo implement a remedy for the violation, the court deemed Frye\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to allow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty to any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to charge.  This Court granted certiorari. 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is well settled that the right to the effective assistance of counsel applies to certain steps before trial.  The \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nSixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present at all \xe2\x80\x98critical\xe2\x80\x99 stages of the criminal proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Montejo v. Louisiana, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 778, \n786 (2009)\n (quoting United States v. Wade, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93228 (1967)).  Critical stages include arraignments, postindictment interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the entry of a guilty plea.  See Hamilton v. Alabama, \n\n368 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52 (1961)\n (arraignment); Massiah v. United States, \n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 201 (1964)\n (postindictment interrogation); Wade, supra (postindictment lineup); Argersinger v. Hamlin, \n\n407 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25 (1972)\n (guilty plea).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith respect to the right to effective counsel in plea negotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two cases from this Court considering the role of counsel in advising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty plea: Hill v. Lockhart, \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52 (1985)\n; and Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___(2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-part test set forth in Strickland.  See Hill, supra, at 57.  As noted above, in Frye\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Missouri Court of Appeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, determined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and second that there was resulting prejudice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the Strickland test.  There, a defendant who had entered a guilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of the amount of time he would have to serve before he became eligible for parole.  But the defendant had not alleged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had been given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and proceed to trial.  Thus, the Court found that no prejudice from the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.  Hill, supra, at 60.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of counsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer that leads to a guilty plea.  Padilla held that a guilty plea, based on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel misinformed the defendant of the immigration consequences of the conviction.  The Court made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the \n \nSixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  It also rejected the argument made by petitioner in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes errors by defense counsel.  Cf. Brief for Respondent in Padilla v. Kentucky, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2009, No. 08\xe2\x80\x93651, p.\xc2\xa027 (arguing \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s assurance of effective assistance \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge of the consequences that are collateral to the guilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing and intelligent plea\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the case now before the Court the State, as petitioner, points out that the legal question presented is different from that in Hill and Padilla.  In those cases the claim was that the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s plea of guilty was invalid because counsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the plea.  In the instant case, by contrast, the guilty plea that was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in court, were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel.  The challenge is not to the advice pertaining to the plea that was accepted but rather to the course of legal representation that preceded it with respect to other potential pleas and plea offers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo give further support to its contention that the instant case is in a category different from what the Court considered in Hill and Padilla, the State urges that there is no right to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event.  See Weatherford v. Bursey, \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545, \n561 (1977)\n.  It claims Frye therefore was not deprived of any legal benefit to which he was entitled.  Under this view, any wrongful or mistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea offers is beside the point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present.  Before a guilty plea is entered the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the plea and its consequences can be established on the record.  This affords the State substantial protection against later claims that the plea was the result of inadequate advice.  At the plea entry proceedings the trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to establish on the record that the defendant understands the process that led to any offer, the advantages and disadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing consequences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is entered based upon the plea.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa011; Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule\xc2\xa024.02 (2004).  Hill and Padilla both illustrate that, nevertheless, there may be instances when claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the conviction is entered.  Still, the State, and the trial court itself, have had a substantial opportunity to guard against this contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceeding that the defendant has been given proper advice or, if the advice received appears to have been inadequate, to remedy that deficiency before the plea is accepted and the conviction entered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected, however, no formal court proceedings are involved.  This underscores that the plea-bargaining process is often in flux, with no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial supervision of the discussions between prosecution and defense.  Indeed, discussions between client and defense counsel are privileged.  So the prosecution has little or no notice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity to intervene in any event.  And, as noted, the State insists there is no right to receive a plea offer.  For all these reasons, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequacies, especially when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or, as here, for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State\xe2\x80\x99s contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, yet they do not suffice to overcome a simple reality.  Ninety-seven percent of federal con- victions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.

The reality is that plea bargains have become so central to the administration of the criminal justice system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the \n \nSixth Amendment requires in the criminal process at critical stages.  Because ours \xe2\x80\x9cis for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,\xe2\x80\x9d Lafler, post, at 11, it is insufficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo a large extent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. horse trading [between prosecutor and defense counsel] determines who goes to jail and for how long.  That is what plea bargaining is.  It is not some adjunct to the criminal justice system;  it is the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d Scott &amp; Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1909, 1912 (1992).  See also Barkow, Separation of Powers and the Criminal Law, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 989, 1034 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Defendants] who do take their case to trial and lose receive longer sentences than even Congress or the prosecutor might think appropriate, because the longer sentences exist on the books largely for bargaining purposes.  This often results in individuals who accept a plea bargain receiving shorter sentences than other individuals who are less morally culpable but take a chance and go to trial\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  In today\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost always the critical point for a defendant.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criticize it.  The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial resources and for defendants to admit their crimes and receive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a plea agreement can benefit both parties.  In order that these benefits can be realized, however, criminal defendants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnything less .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might deny a defendant \xe2\x80\x98effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Massiah, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204 (quoting Spano v.

This is a difficult question.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and it presents questions farther removed from immediate judicial supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Premo v. Moore, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  Bargaining is, by its nature, defined to a substantial degree by personal style.  The alternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so individual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to try to elaborate or define detailed standards for the proper discharge of defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the process.  Cf. ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to define the duties of defense counsel in those respects, however.  Here the question is whether defense counsel has the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a lesser sentence, a conviction on lesser charges, or both.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.  Any exceptions to that rule need not be explored here, for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.  When defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the Constitution requires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThough the standard for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance is not determined solely by reference to codified standards of professional practice, these standards can be important guides.  The American Bar Association recommends defense counsel \xe2\x80\x9cpromptly communicate and explain to the defendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attorney,\xe2\x80\x9d ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty 14\xe2\x80\x933.2(a) (3d ed. 1999), and this standard has been adopted by numerous state and federal courts over the last 30 years.  See, e.g., Davie v. State, 381 S.\xc2\xa0C. 601, 608\xe2\x80\x93609, 675 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 416, 420 (2009); Cottle v. State, 733 So.\xc2\xa02d 963, 965\xe2\x80\x93966 (Fla. 1999); Becton v.

First, the fact of a formal offer means that its terms and its processing can be documented so that what took place in the negotiation process becomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the conduct of earlier pretrial negotiations.  Second, States may elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing, again to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabricated charges.  See N.\xc2\xa0J. Ct. Rule 3:9\xe2\x80\x931(b) (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny plea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing and forwarded to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).  Third, formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before a trial on the merits, all to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before those further proceedings commence.  At least one State often follows a similar procedure before trial.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 20 (discussing hearings in Arizona conducted pursuant to State v.

Defendants must also demonstrate a reasonable probability the plea would have been entered without the prosecution canceling it or the trial court refusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.  To establish prejudice in this instance, it is necessary to show a reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.  Cf. Glover v. United States, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198, \n203 (2001)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny amount of [additional] jail time has \n \nSixth Amendment significance\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis application of Strickland to the instances of an uncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill.  In cases where a defendant complains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer as opposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant will have to show \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hill, 474 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59.  Hill was correctly decided and applies in the context in which it arose.  Hill does not, however, provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from the deficient performance of counsel during plea negotiations.  Unlike the defendant in Hill, Frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer (limiting his sentence to one year in prison) as opposed to entering an open plea (exposing him to a maximum sentence of four years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment).  In a case, such as this, where a defendant pleads guilty to less favorable terms and claims that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to miss out on a more favorable earlier plea offer, Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial absent ineffective assistance but whether he would have accepted the offer to plead pursuant to the terms earlier proposed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn order to complete a showing of Strickland prejudice, defendants who have shown a reasonable probability they would have accepted the earlier plea offer must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel it or if the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented.  This further showing is of particular importance because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford, 429 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561, nor a federal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New York, \n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 257, \n262 (1971)\n.  In at least some States, including Missouri, it appears the prosecution has some discretion to cancel a plea agreement to which the defendant has agreed, see, e.g., 311 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 359 (case below); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa017.4(b) (Supp. 2011).  The Federal Rules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3); see Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4); Boykin v. Alabama, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238\n\xe2\x80\x93244 (1969).  It can be assumed that in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.  So in most instances it should not be difficult to make an objective assessment as to whether or not a particular fact or intervening circumstance would suffice, in the normal course, to cause prosecutorial withdrawal or judicial nonapproval of a plea bargain.  The determination that there is or is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different absent counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors can be conducted within that framework.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese standards must be applied to the instant case.  As regards the deficient performance prong of Strickland, the Court of Appeals found the \xe2\x80\x9crecord is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the [formal] Offer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evidence that Frye\xe2\x80\x99s conduct interfered with trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  311 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 356.  On this record, it is evident that Frye\xe2\x80\x99s attorney did not make a meaningful attempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer before the offer expired.  See supra, at 2.  The Missouri Court of Appeals was correct that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Strickland, supra, at 688.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the precise standard for prejudice in this context.  As noted, a defendant in Frye\xe2\x80\x99s position must show not only a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed plea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement and that it would have been accepted by the trial court.  Frye can show he would have accepted the offer, but there is strong reason to doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have permitted the plea bargain to become final.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would have accepted the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s original offer of a plea bargain if the offer had been communicated to him, because he pleaded guilty to a more serious charge, with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prosecutor.  It may be that in some cases defendants must show more than just a guilty plea to a charge or sentence harsher than the original offer.  For example, revelations between plea offers about the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case may make a late decision to plead guilty insufficient to demonstrate, without further evidence, that the defendant would have pleaded guilty to an earlier, more generous plea offer if his counsel had reported it to him.  Here, however, that is not the case.  The Court of Appeals did not err in finding Frye\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the less favorable plea offer indicated that he would have accepted the earlier (and more favorable) offer had he been apprised of it; and there is no need to address here the showings that might be required in other cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals failed, however, to require Frye to show that the first plea offer, if accepted by Frye, would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court.  Whether the prosecution and trial court are required to do so is a matter of state law, and it is not the place of this Court to settle those matters.  The Court has established the minimum requirements of the \n \nSixth Amendment as interpreted in Strickland, and States have the discretion to add procedural protections under state law if they choose.  A State may choose to preclude the prosecution from withdrawing a plea offer once it has been accepted or perhaps to preclude a trial court from rejecting a plea bargain.  In Missouri, it appears \xe2\x80\x9ca plea offer once accepted by the defendant can be withdrawn without re- course\xe2\x80\x9d by the prosecution.  311 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 359.  The ex- tent of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in Missouri to reject a plea agreement appears to be in some doubt. Compare id., at 360, with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consider these state-law questions, because they bear on the federal question of Strickland prejudice.  If, as the Missouri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the prosecutor would have adhered to the agreement, there is no Strickland prejudice.  Likewise, if the trial court could have refused to accept the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no Strickland prejudice.  In this case, given Frye\xe2\x80\x99s new offense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless they were required by state law to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals to address this question in the first instance.

The principal difference between the cases is that the fairness of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction in Lafler was established by a full trial and jury verdict, whereas Frye\xe2\x80\x99s conviction here was established by his own admission of guilt, received by the court after the usual colloquy that assured it was voluntary and truthful.  In Lafler all that could be said (and as I discuss there it was quite enough) is that the fairness of the conviction was clear, though a unanimous jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt can sometimes be wrong.  Here it can be said not only that the process was fair, but that the defendant acknowledged the correctness of his conviction.  Thus, as far as the reasons for my dissent are concerned, this is an a\xc2\xa0fortiori case.  I will not repeat here the constitutional points that I discuss at length in Lafler, but I will briefly apply those points to the facts here and comment upon a few statements in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGalin Frye\xe2\x80\x99s attorney failed to inform him about a plea offer, and Frye ultimately pleaded guilty without the benefit of a deal.

So little entitlement that, had he known of and accepted the bargain, the prosecution would have been able to withdraw it right up to the point that his guilty plea pursuant to the bargain was accepted.

App. 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court acknowledges, moreover, that Frye\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was untainted by attorney error: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he guilty plea that was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in court, were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5.  Given the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate focus\xe2\x80\x9d of our ineffective-assistance cases on \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, \n696 (1984)\n, that should be the end of the matter.  Instead, here, as in Lafler, the Court mechanically applies an outcome-based test for prejudice, and mistakes the possibility of a different result for constitutional injustice.  As I explain in Lafler, post, p. ___ (dissenting opinion), that approach is contrary to our precedents on the right to effective counsel, and for good reason.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court announces its holding that \xe2\x80\x9cas a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d as though that resolves a disputed point; in reality, however, neither the State nor the Solicitor General argued that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance here was adequate.  Ante, at 9.  The only issue was whether the in- adequacy deprived Frye of his constitutional right to a fair trial.  In other cases, however, it will not be so clear that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s plea-bargaining skills, which must now meet a constitutional minimum, are adequate.  \xe2\x80\x9c[H]ow to define the duty and responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9cis a difficult question,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9c[b]argaining is, by its nature, defined to a substantial degree by personal style.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  Indeed.  What if an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal style\xe2\x80\x9d is to establish a reputation as a hard bargainer by, for example, advising clients to proceed to trial rather than accept anything but the most favorable plea offers?  It seems inconceivable that a lawyer could compromise his client\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights so that he can secure better deals for other clients in the future; does a hard-bargaining \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal style\xe2\x80\x9d now violate the \n \nSixth Amendment?  The Court ignores such difficulties, however, since \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to define the duties of defense counsel in those respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  Perhaps not.  But it does present the necessity of confronting the serious difficulties that will be created by constitutionalization of the plea-bargaining process.  It will not do simply to announce that they will be solved in the sweet by-and-by.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the inadequacy of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance in this case is clear enough, whether it was prejudicial (in the sense that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new version of Strickland requires) is not.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of how that question is to be answered on remand is alone enough to show how unwise it is to constitutionalize the plea-bargaining process.  Prejudice is to be determined, the Court tells us, by a process of retrospective crystal-ball gazing posing as legal analysis.  First of all, of course, we must estimate whether the defendant would have accepted the earlier plea bargain.  Here that seems an easy question, but as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 14, it will not always be.  Next, since Missouri, like other States, permits accepted plea offers to be withdrawn by the prosecution (a reality which alone should suffice, one would think, to demonstrate that Frye had no entitlement to the plea bargain), we must estimate whether the prosecution would have withdrawn the plea offer.  And finally, we must estimate whether the trial court would have approved the plea agreement.  These last two estimations may seem easy in the present case, since Frye committed a new infraction before the hearing at which the agreement would have been presented; but they assuredly will not be easy in the mine run of cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court says \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t can be assumed that in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  Assuredly it can, just as it can be assumed that the sun rises in the west; but I know of no basis for the assumption.  Virtually no cases deal with the standards for a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from a plea agreement beyond stating the general rule that a prosecutor may withdraw any time prior to, but not after, the entry of a guilty plea or other action constituting detrimental reliance on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s part.  See, e.g., United States v. Kuchinski, 469 F.\xc2\xa03d 853, 857\xe2\x80\x93858 (CA9 2006).  And cases addressing trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to accept or reject plea agreements almost universally observe that a trial court enjoys broad discretion in this regard.  See, e.g., Missouri v. Banks, 135 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 497, 500 (Mo. App. 2004) (trial court abuses its discretion in rejecting a plea only if the decision \xe2\x80\x9cis so arbitrary and unreasonable that it shocks the sense of justice and indicates a lack of careful con- sideration\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Of course after today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions there will be cases galore, so the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption would better be cast as an optimistic prediction of the certainty that will emerge, many years hence, from our newly created constitutional field of plea-bargaining law.  Whatever the \xe2\x80\x9cboundaries\xe2\x80\x9d ultimately devised (if that were possible), a vast amount of discretion will still remain, and it is extraordinary to make a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights depend upon a series of ret- rospective mind-readings as to how that discretion, in prosecutors and trial judges, would have been exercised.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plea-bargaining process is a subject worthy of regulation, since it is the means by which most criminal convictions are obtained.  It happens not to be, however, a subject covered by the \n \nSixth Amendment, which is concerned not with the fairness of bargaining but with the fairness of conviction.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world; and when we ignore its text in order to make it that, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack hammer is needed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  In this case and its companion, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sledge may require the reversal of perfectly valid, eminently just, convictions.  A legislature could solve the problems presented by these cases in a much more precise and efficient manner.  It might begin, for example, by penalizing the attorneys who made such grievous errors.  That type of sub-constitutional remedy is not available to the Court, which is limited to penalizing (almost) everyone else by reversing valid convictions or sentences.  Because that result is inconsistent with the \n \nSixth Amendment and decades of our precedent, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
