S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), petitioner James admitted to the three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment, including a Florida state-law conviction for attempted burglary.  The Government argued at sentencing that those convictions subjected James to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term provided by the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \xc2\xa7924(e), for an armed defendant who has three prior \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d convictions.  James objected that his attempted burglary conviction was not for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court held that it was, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA.

Stat. \xc2\xa7810.02(1), and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cA person who \xe2\x80\xa6 does any act toward the commission of [an offense] but fails in the perpetration or \xe2\x80\xa6 execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7777.04(1).  The attempted burglary conviction at issue was punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.  The parties agree that it does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under clause (i) of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) or as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii).  For example, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d because it does not meet the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary\xe2\x80\x9d found in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 598: \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the question here is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida, falls within clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision for crimes that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s text does not exclude attempt offenses from the residual provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  James\xe2\x80\x99 claim that clause (i)s\xe2\x80\x99 express inclusion of attempts, combined with clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s failure to mention them, demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude them from clause (ii) would unduly narrow the residual provision, which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempts that otherwise meet the statutory criteria.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Echazabal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/73/index.html">536 U. S. 73</a>, 80.  James also argues to no avail that, under the <em>ejusdem generis</em> canon, the residual provision must be read to extend only to completed offenses<em> </em>because the specifically enumerated offenses\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives crimes\xe2\x80\x94all have that common attribute.  Rather, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses is that, while not technically crimes against the person, they nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury to others, or of violent confrontation that could lead to such injury.  See <em>e.g., Taylor, supra</em>, at 597.  The inclusion of the residual provision indicates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent that the preceding enumerated offenses not be an exhaustive list.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Nor does the legislative history exclude attempt offenses from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision.  Whatever weight might ordinarily be given the House\xe2\x80\x99s 1984 rejection of language that would have included attempted robbery and attempted burglary as ACCA predicate offenses, it is not probative here because the 1984 action was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 last word on the subject.  Since clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision was added to ACCA in 1988, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1984 rejection of the language including attempt offenses is not dispositive.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d under the residual provision.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d it has used for other ACCA offenses, the Court considers whether the offense\xe2\x80\x99s elements are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the particular offender\xe2\x80\x99s specific conduct.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Taylor, supra,</em> at 602.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9318.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0On its face, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s attempt statute requires only that a defendant take \xe2\x80\x9cany act toward the commission\xe2\x80\x9d of burglary.  But because the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Jones </em>decision considerably narrowed the application of this broad language in the context of attempted burglary, requiring an overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure, merely preparatory activity posing no real danger of harm to others, <em>e.g.,</em> acquiring burglars\xe2\x80\x99 tools or casing a structure, is not enough.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d under the residual provision of clause (ii).  The clause\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated offenses provide one baseline from which to measure whether similar conduct satisfies the quoted language.  Here, the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses, completed burglary.  See<em> Taylor, supra</em>, at 600, n.\xc2\xa09.  The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering another\xe2\x80\x99s property, but from the possibility that an innocent person might confront the burglar during the crime.  Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk.  Indeed, that risk may be even greater than the risk posed by a typical completed burglary.  Many completed burglaries do not involve confrontations, but attempted burglaries often do.  Every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted burglary law similar to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s has held that attempted burglary qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Support is also found in the U. S. Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a predicate \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 career offender enhancement \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[s] \xe2\x80\xa6 attempting to commit [an] offens[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  See Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa74B1.2, comment., n.\xc2\xa01.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Neither ACCA nor <em>Taylor </em>supports James\xe2\x80\x99 argument that, under the categorical approach, attempted burglary cannot be treated as an ACCA predicate offense unless <em>all </em>cases present a risk of physical injury to others.  ACCA does not require such certainty, and James\xe2\x80\x99 argument misapprehends <em>Taylor, </em>under which the proper inquiry is not whether every factual offense conceivably covered by a statute necessarily presents a serious potential risk of injury, but whether the conduct encompassed by the offense\xe2\x80\x99s elements, in the ordinary case, presents such a risk.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0James\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the scope of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense is not persuasive.  Although the state-law definition of \xe2\x80\x9c[d]welling\xe2\x80\x9d to include the \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7810.011(2), takes Florida\xe2\x80\x99s underlying burglary offense outside <em>Taylor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary\xe2\x80\x9d definition, 495 U. S., at 598, that is not dispositive because the Government does not argue that James\xe2\x80\x99 conviction constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA.  Rather, it relies on the residual provision, which\xe2\x80\x94as <em>Taylor </em>recognized\xe2\x80\x94can cover conduct outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 600, n.\xc2\xa09.  The Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Hamilton</em> decision construed curtilage narrowly, requiring some form of enclosure for the area surrounding a residence. A burglar illegally attempting to enter the curtilage around a dwelling creates much the same risk of confrontation as one attempting to enter the structure itself.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Because the Court is here engaging in statutory interpretation, not judicial factfinding, James\xe2\x80\x99 argument that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U.

In his guilty plea, James admitted to the three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment.  These included a conviction in Florida state court for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Florida Statutes \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7810.02 and 777.04.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At sentencing, the Government argued that James was subject to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s 15-year mandatory minimum term because of his three prior convictions.

The District Court held that attempted burglary is a violent felony, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that holding, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 1150, 1157 (2005).

Stat. \xc2\xa7810.02(1) (1993).  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s criminal attempt statute provided: \xe2\x80\x9cA person who attempts to commit an offense prohibited by law and in such attempt does any act toward the commission of such offense, but fails in the perpetration or is intercepted or prevented in the execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7777.04(1).  The attempted burglary conviction at issue here was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties agree that attempted burglary does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under clause (i) of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition because it does not have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Nor does it qualify as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii).  Attempted burglary is not robbery or extortion.  It does not involve the use of explosives.  And it is not \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d because it does not meet the definition of burglary under ACCA that this Court set forth in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 598 (1990): \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Fla.

We conclude that nothing in the plain language of clause (ii), when read together with the rest of the statute, prohibits attempt offenses from qualifying as ACCA predicates when they involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James first argues that the residual provision of clause (ii) must be read in conjunction with clause (i), which expressly includes in its definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d offenses that have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>attempted use</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).  James thus concludes that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express inclusion of attempt offenses in clause (i), combined with its failure to mention attempts in clause (ii), demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the latter provision.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded.  James\xe2\x80\x99 reading would unduly narrow clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision, the language of which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt offenses that otherwise meet the statutory criteria.  Clause (i), in contrast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus making it necessary to specify exactly what types of offenses\xe2\x80\x94including attempt offenses\xe2\x80\x94are covered by its language.  In short, \xe2\x80\x9cthe expansive phrasing of\xe2\x80\x9d clause (ii) \xe2\x80\x9cpoints directly away from the sort of exclusive specification\xe2\x80\x9d that James would read into it.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Echazabal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/73/index.html">536 U. S. 73</a>, 80 (2002); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, 16 F.\xc2\xa03d 212, 217 (CA7) (rejecting argument that \xe2\x80\x9chad Congress wished to include attempted burglary as a \xc2\xa7924(e) predicate offense, it would have done so expressly\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cuntenable in light of the very existence of the \xe2\x80\x98otherwise\xe2\x80\x99 clause, which Congress plainly intended to serve as a catch-all provision\xe2\x80\x9d), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/945/index.html">513 U. S. 945</a> (1994).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James next invokes the canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em>\xe2\x80\x94that when a general phrase follows a list of specifics, it should be read to include only things of the same type as those specifically enumerated.  He argues that the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon attribute\xe2\x80\x9d of the offenses specifically enumerated in clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94is that they are all completed offenses.  The residual provision, he contends, should similarly be read to extend only to completed offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is unavailing.  As an initial matter, the premise on which it depends\xe2\x80\x94that clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s specifically enumerated crimes are limited to completed offenses\xe2\x80\x94is false.  An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government building, for example, would qualify as a specifically enumerated predicate offense because it would \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] [the] use of explosives.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7844(f)(1) (making it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously damag[e] or destro[y], or <em>attemp[t]</em> to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,\xe2\x80\x9d certain property used in or affecting interstate commerce (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives use is not \xe2\x80\x9ccompletion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury.  As we noted in <em>Taylor</em>,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCongress thought that certain general categories of property crimes\xe2\x80\x94namely burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94so often presented a risk of injury to persons, or were so often committed by career criminals, that they should be included in the enhancement statute even though, considered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not necessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.

Nothing in the statutory language supports the view that Congress intended to limit this category solely to completed offenses.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James also relies on ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history to buttress his argument that clause (ii) categorically excludes attempt offenses.  In the deliberations leading up to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s adoption in 1984, the House rejected a version of the statute that would have provided enhanced penalties for use of a firearm by persons with two prior convictions for \xe2\x80\x9cany robbery or burglary offense, <em>or a conspiracy or attempt to commit such an offense</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa72 (1984) (emphasis added).  The bill that ultimately became law omitted any reference to attempts, and simply defined \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9crobbery or burglary, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d  Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, \xc2\xa71802, 98 Stat. 2185, repealed in 1986 by Pub. L. 99\xe2\x80\x93308, \xc2\xa7104(b), 100 Stat. 459.  James argues that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of this explicit \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d language in 1984 evidenced an intent to exclude attempted burglary as a predicate offense.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever weight this legislative history might ordinarily have, we do not find it probative here, because the 1984 enactment on which James relies was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 last word on the subject.  In 1986, Congress amended ACCA for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expanding\xe2\x80\x99 the range of predicate offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 584.  The 1986 amendments added the more expansive language that is at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94including clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s language defining as violent felonies offenses that are \xe2\x80\x9cburglary, arson, extortion, involv[e] use of explosives, or otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \xc2\xa71402(b), 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x9340, codified at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  This language is substantially broader than the 1984 provision that it amended.  Because both the Government and the Court of Appeals relied on the broader language of the 1986 amendments\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the residual provision\xe2\x80\x94as the textual basis for including attempted burglary within the law\xe2\x80\x99s scope, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of express language including attempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not dispositive.  Congress did not consider, much less reject, any such language when it enacted the 1986 amendments.  What it did consider, and ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded residual clause that does not by its terms exclude attempt offenses, and whose reach is broad enough to encompass at least some such offenses.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that neither the statutory text nor the legislative history discloses any congressional intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision, we next ask whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is an offense that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  In answering this question, we employ the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has taken with respect to other offenses under ACCA.  Under this approach, we \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and do not generally consider the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 17 (2005) (quoting <em>Taylor</em>, 495 U. S., at 602).  That is, we consider whether the <em>elements of the offense</em> are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin by examining what constitutes attempted burglary under Florida law.  On its face, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s attempt statute requires only that a defendant take \xe2\x80\x9cany act toward the commission\xe2\x80\x9d of burglary.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7777.04(1).  James contends that this broad statutory language sweeps in merely preparatory activity that poses no real danger of harm to others\xe2\x80\x94for example, acquiring burglars\xe2\x80\x99 tools or casing a structure while planning a burglary.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But while the statutory language is broad, the Florida Supreme Court has considerably narrowed its application in the context of attempted burglary, requiring an \xe2\x80\x9covert act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>State</em>, 608 So.\xc2\xa02d 797, 799 (1992).  Mere preparation is not enough.  See <em>ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em>  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s lower courts appear to have consistently applied this heightened standard.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>State</em>, 922 So.\xc2\xa02d 331, 334 (App. 2006); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State</em>, 741 So.\xc2\xa02d 1213, 1214 (App. 1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The pivotal question, then, is whether overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, is \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In answering this question, we look to the statutory language for guidance.  The specific offenses enumerated in clause (ii) provide one baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise \xe2\x80\xa6 presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this case, we can ask whether the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses\xe2\x80\x94here, completed burglary.  See<em> Taylor</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 600, n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government remains free to argue that any offense\xe2\x80\x94including offenses similar to generic burglary\xe2\x80\x94should count towards enhancement as one that \xe2\x80\x98otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x99 under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\xe2\x80\x99s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party\xe2\x80\x94whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander\xe2\x80\x94who comes to investigate.  That is, the risk arises not from the completion of the burglary, but from the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk.  Interrupting an intruder at the doorstep while the would-be burglar is attempting a break-in creates a risk of violent confrontation comparable to that posed by finding him inside the structure itself.  As one court has explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn all of these cases the risk of injury arises, not from the completion of the break-in, but rather from the possibility that some innocent party may appear on the scene while the break-in is occurring.  This is just as likely to happen before the defendant succeeds in breaking in as after.  Indeed, the possibility may be at its peak while the defendant is still outside trying to break in, as that is when he is likely to be making noise and exposed to the public view\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]here is a serious risk of confrontation while a perpetrator is attempting to enter the building.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payne</em>, 966 F.\xc2\xa02d 4, 8 (CA1 1992).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the risk posed by an attempted burglary that can serve as the basis for an ACCA enhancement may be even greater than that posed by a typical completed burglary.  All burglaries begin as attempted burglaries.  But ACCA only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries where the offender has been apprehended, prosecuted, and convicted.  This will typically occur when the attempt is thwarted by some outside intervenor\xe2\x80\x94be it a property owner or law enforcement officer.  Many completed burglaries do not involve such confrontations.  But attempted burglaries often do; indeed, it is often just such outside intervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into completion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concluding that attempted burglary presents a risk that is comparable to the risk posed by the completed offense, every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted burglary law similar in scope to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s has held that the offense qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The only cases holding to the contrary involved attempt laws that could be satisfied by preparatory conduct that does not pose the same risk of violent confrontation and physical harm posed by an attempt to enter a structure illegally.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Given that Florida law, as interpreted by that State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, requires an overt act directed toward the entry of a structure, we need not consider whether the more attenuated conduct encompassed by such laws presents a potential risk of serious injury under ACCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Sentencing Commission has come to a similar conclusion with regard to the Sentencing Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 career offender enhancement, whose definition of a predicate \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d closely tracks ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2006) (USSG).  The Commission has determined that \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] of violence\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of the Guidelines enhancement \xe2\x80\x9cinclude the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74B1.2, comment., n.\xc2\xa01.  This judgment was based on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s review of empirical sentencing data and presumably reflects an assessment that attempt crimes often pose a similar risk of injury as completed offenses.  As then-Judge Breyer explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between\xe2\x80\x9d a particular offense and \xe2\x80\x9cthe likelihood of accompanying violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe</em>, 960 F.\xc2\xa02d 221, 225 (CA1 1992); see also USSG \xc2\xa71A3 (Nov. 1987), reprinted in \xc2\xa71A1.1 comment.

While we are not bound by the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, we view it as further evidence that a crime like attempted burglary poses a risk of violence similar to that presented by the completed offense.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James responds that it is not enough that attempted burglary \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generally\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98most cases\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d will create a risk of physical injury to others.  Brief for Petitioner 32.  Citing the categorical approach we employed in <em>Taylor</em>, he argues that we cannot treat attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense unless <em>all </em>cases present such a risk.  James\xe2\x80\x99 approach is supported by neither the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text nor this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Taylor</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One could, of course, imagine a situation in which attempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone\xe2\x80\x94for example, a break-in of an unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and away from any potential intervenors.  But ACCA does not require metaphysical certainty.  Rather, \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision speaks in terms of a \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  These are inherently probabilistic concepts.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Indeed, the combination of the two terms suggests that Congress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple \xe2\x80\x9crisk,\xe2\x80\x9d much less a certainty.  While there may be some attempted burglaries that do not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, the same is true of completed burglaries\xe2\x80\x94which are explicitly covered by the statutory language and provide a baseline against which to measure the degree of risk that a non-enumerated offense must \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d present in order to qualify.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James\xe2\x80\x99 argument also misapprehends <em>Taylor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach.  We do not view that approach as requiring that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.  Cf. <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Duenas-Alvarez</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.  It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.  One can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury\xe2\x80\x94for example, an attempted murder where the gun, unbeknownst to the shooter, had no bullets, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas</em>, 361 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 659 (CADC 2004).  Or, to take an example from the offenses specifically enumerated in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extortion scheme where an anonymous blackmailer threatens to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments.  In both cases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches zero.  But that does not mean that the offenses of attempted murder or extortion are categorically nonviolent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As long as an offense is of a type that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another, it satisfies the requirements of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision.  Attempted burglary under Florida law\xe2\x80\x94as construed in <em>Jones</em> to require an overt act directed toward entry of a structure\xe2\x80\x94satisfies this test.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent criticizes our approach on the ground that it does not provide sufficient guidance for lower courts required to decide whether unenumerated offenses other than attempted burglary qualify as violent felonies under ACCA.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative approach has more serious disadvantages.  Among other things, that approach unnecessarily decides an important question that the parties have not briefed (the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)), decides that question in a way that is hardly free from doubt, and fails to provide an interpretation of the residual provision that furnishes clear guidance for future cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent interprets the residual provision to require at least as much risk as the least dangerous enumerated offense.  But the ordinary meaning of the language of the residual clause does not impose such a requirement.  What the clause demands is \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  While it may be reasonable to infer that the risks presented by the enumerated offenses involve a risk of this magnitude, it does not follow that an offense that presents a lesser risk necessarily fails to qualify.  Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules out the possibility that an offense may present \xe2\x80\x9ca serious risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case.  Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as one<em> </em>of the enumerated offenses.  Thus, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d is unnecessary\xe2\x80\x94and inadvisable.  The parties have not briefed this issue, and the proposed interpretation is hardly beyond question.  Instead of interpreting the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with its meaning at common law or in modern federal and state statutes, see <em>Taylor</em>, 495 U. S., at 598, it is suggested that we adopt an interpretation that seems to be entirely novel and that greatly reduces the reach of ACCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The stated reason for tackling this question is to provide guidance for the lower courts in future cases\xe2\x80\x94surely a worthy objective.  But in practical terms, the proposed interpretation of the residual clause would not make it much easier for the lower courts to decide whether other unenumerated offenses qualify.  Without hard statistics\xe2\x80\x94and no such statistics have been called to our attention\xe2\x80\x94how is a lower court to determine whether the risk posed by generic burglary is greater or less than the risk posed by an entirely unrelated unenumerated offense\xe2\x80\x94say, escape from prison?<font super="1"> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of this case turns on the same question as ours\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the comparative risks presented by burglary and attempted burglary.  The risk of physical injury in both cases occurs when there is a confrontation between the criminal and another person, whether an occupant of the structure, a law enforcement officer or security guard, or someone else.  It is argued that when such an encounter occurs during a consummated burglary (<em>i.e.</em>, after entry), the risk is greater than it is when the encounter occurs during an attempted burglary (<em>i.e.</em>, before entry is effected), and that may be true.  But this argument fails to come to grips with the fact that such encounters may occur much more frequently during attempted burglaries because it is precisely due to such encounters that many planned burglaries do not progress beyond the attempt stage.  Justice Scalia dismisses the danger involved when an encounter occur during attempted burglaries, stating that such encounters are \xe2\x80\x9clikely to consist of nothing more than the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s yelling, \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 from his window, and the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s running away.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 13.  But there are many other possible scenarios.  An armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch program.  Or a homeowner angered by the sort of conduct recited in James\xe2\x80\x99 presentence report\xe2\x80\x94throwing a hammer through a window\xe2\x80\x94may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue.  For these reasons and the reasons discussed above, we are convinced that the offense of attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, qualifies under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the question on which this Court granted certiorari focused on the attempt prong of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s attempted burglary law, James also argues that the scope of the State\xe2\x80\x99s underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as a violent felony for ACCA purposes.  Specifically, he argues that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s burglary statute differs from \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d burglary as defined in <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 598, because it defines a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[d]welling\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to include not only the structure itself, but also the \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7810.011(2) (1993).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree that the inclusion of curtilage takes Florida\xe2\x80\x99s underlying offense of burglary outside the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in <em>Taylor</em>, which requires an unlawful entry into, or remaining in, \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>building or other structure</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.

But that conclusion is not dispositive, because the Government does not argue that James\xe2\x80\x99 conviction for attempted burglary constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Rather, it relies on the residual provision of that clause, which\xe2\x80\x94as the Court has recognized\xe2\x80\x94can cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 600, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is the risk posed by an attempted entry of the curtilage comparable to that posed by the attempted entry of a structure (which, as we concluded above, is sufficient to qualify under the residual provision)?  We must again turn to state law in order to answer this question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court has construed curtilage narrowly, requiring \xe2\x80\x9csome form of an enclosure in order for the area surrounding a residence to be considered part of the \xe2\x80\x98curtilage\xe2\x80\x99 as referred to in the burglary statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton</em>, 660 So.\xc2\xa02d 1038, 1044 (1995) (holding that a yard surrounded by trees was not \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matthews</em>, 466 F.\xc2\xa03d 1271, 1274 (CA11 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cFlorida case law construes curtilage narrowly, to include only an enclosed area surrounding a structure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given this narrow definition, we do not believe that the inclusion of curtilage so mitigates the risk presented by attempted burglary as to take the offense outside the scope of clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A typical reason for enclosing the curtilage adjacent to a structure is to keep out unwanted visitors\xe2\x80\x94especially those with criminal motives.  And a burglar who illegally attempts to enter the enclosed area surrounding a dwelling creates much the same risk of physical confrontation with a property owner, law enforcement official, or other third party as does one who attempts to enter the structure itself.  In light of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s narrow definition of curtilage, attempted burglary of the curtilage requires both physical proximity to the structure and an overt act directed toward breaching the enclosure.  Such an attempt \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1275 (holding that burglary of the curtilage is a violent felony under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision).</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, James argues that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and its progeny because it is based on \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial fact finding\xe2\x80\x9d about the risk presented by \xe2\x80\x9cthe acts that underlie \xe2\x80\x98most\xe2\x80\x99 convictions for attempted burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 34, 35.

Indeed, by applying <em>Taylor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach, we have avoided any inquiry into the underlying facts of James\xe2\x80\x99 particular offense, and have looked solely to the elements of attempted burglary as defined by Florida law.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  This was the basis for the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  (\xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\xa6 hold that an attempt to commit burglary \xe2\x80\xa6 presents the potential risk of physical injury to another sufficient to satisfy the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x98violent felony,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 1150, 1157 (2005)), and it is the center of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute before this Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to determining which crimes fit within the residual provision is that it is almost entirely ad\xc2\xa0hoc.  <em>This </em>crime, the Court says, <em>does </em>\xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  That gets this case off our docket, sure enough.  But it utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the ACCA residual provision will be applied with an acceptable degree of consistency by the hundreds of district judges that impose sentences every day.  The one guideline the Court does suggest is that the sentencer should compare the unenumerated offense at issue with the \xe2\x80\x9cclosest analog\xe2\x80\x9d among the four offenses that are set forth (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives), and should include the unenumerated offense within ACCA if the risk it poses is \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 9.  The principal attraction of this test, I suspect, is that it makes it relatively easy to decide the present case (though, as I shall subsequently discuss, I think the Court reaches the wrong conclusion as to whether attempted burglary poses a comparable risk).  Assuming that \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cabout the same,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test does provide some guidance where the most closely analogous offense is clear (as here) <em>and </em>the risk is comparable.  But what if, as will very often be the case, it is not at all obvious which of the four enumerated offenses is the closest analog\xe2\x80\x94or if (to tell the truth) none of them is analogous at all?  Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?  And if an analog <em>is </em>identified, what is to be done if the offense at issue does <em>not </em>present a comparable risk?  The Court declines to say, but it seems inconceivable that it means the offense to be <em>excluded</em> from ACCA for that reason.  For example, it does not comport with any conceivable congressional intent to disqualify an unenumerated crime that is most analogous to arson and presents nowhere near the risk of injury posed by arson, but presents a far <em>greater</em> risk of injury than burglary, which Congress has explicitly included.  Thus, for what is probably the vast majority of cases, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provides no guidance whatever, leaving the lower courts to their own devices in deciding, crime-by-crime, which conviction \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  It will take decades, and dozens of grants of certiorari, to allocate all the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s crimes to one or the other side of this entirely reasonable and entirely indeterminate line.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 10 (concluding that attempted burglary poses sufficient risk), with <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/1/index.html">543 U.

Years of prison hinge on the scope of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined.  If we are not going to deny effect to this statute as being impermissibly vague, see Part III, <em>infra</em>, we have the responsibility to derive from the text rules of application that will provide notice of what is covered and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory sentencing.  See <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a>, 357 (1983).

See 430 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1154, 1156\xe2\x80\x931157.  This \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally prohibits the later court from delving into particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, thus leaving the court normally to \xe2\x80\x98look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U.

As the Court does, <em>ante</em>, at 8, I would also begin with this approach.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government would have us provide some certainty\xe2\x80\x94at least enough to decide the present case\xe2\x80\x94by holding that the attempt to commit a crime of violence should be treated the same as the completed crime.  It points out that various federal laws, and many state laws, punish attempt with the same sanction as the completed crime.  See Brief for United States 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  This would be persuasive if punishment were meted out solely on the basis of the risk of physical injury that a crime presents.  It seems to me, however, that similar punishment does not necessarily imply similar risk; it more likely represents a judgment that the two crimes display a similar degree of depravity deserving of punishment or needful of deterrence.  A person guilty of attempted burglary may not have placed anyone at physical risk, but he was just as <em>willing</em> to do so as the successful burglar.  It seems to me impossible to say that equivalence of punishment suggests equivalence of imposed risk.  I therefore look elsewhere for some clarification of the statutory text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First to invite analysis is the word Congress placed at the forefront of the residual provision: \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  When used as an adverb (as it is in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), modifying the verb \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a different manner\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin another way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1954).  Thus, the most natural reading of the statute is that committing one of the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving explosives) is <em>one way</em> to commit a crime \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d; and that <em>other ways</em> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, the enumerated crimes are examples of what Congress had in mind under the residual provision, and the residual provision should be interpreted with those examples in mind.  This commonsense principle of construction is sometimes referred to as the canon of <em>ejusdem generis:</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a general word or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only persons or things of the same type as those listed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 535 (7th ed. 1999) (Black\xe2\x80\x99s) see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (2003).  In this case, the application of that principle suggests that what the residual provision means by the general phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d is conduct that resembles, insofar as the degree of such risk is concerned, the previously enumerated crimes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In another context, I might conclude that any degree of risk that is merely <em>similar</em>, even if <em>slightly less</em>, would qualify.  Obviously, such an interpretation would leave a good deal of ambiguity on the downside: How low on the risk scale can one go before the risk becomes <em>too</em> dissimilar from the enumerated crimes?  Since the text sets forth no criterion, courts might vary dramatically in their answer.  Cf. <em>Leocal,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a> (reversing the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that driving under the influence of alcohol qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716).  Where it is reasonably avoidable, such indeterminateness is unacceptable in the context of criminal sanctions.  The rule of lenity, grounded in part on the need to give \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fair warning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of what is encompassed by a criminal statute, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bass</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/index.html">404 U. S. 336</a>, 348 (1971) (quoting <em>McBoyle</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/25/index.html">283 U. S. 25</a>, 27 (1931)), demands that we give this text the more narrow reading of which it is susceptible.  The requirement that the degree of risk be similar to that for the enumerated crimes means that it be no lesser than the risk posed by the least dangerous of those enumerated crimes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would turn, then, to the next logical question: Which of the four enumerated crimes\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94poses the least \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d?  The two that involve use of fire or explosives cannot possibly qualify.  Thus, the question I must address is whether burglary or extortion poses a lesser risk.  To do so, I must first define those crimes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Taylor</em>, we defined \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the very provision of ACCA at issue here.  We first determined that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7924(e) must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States\xe2\x80\x99 criminal codes.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U. S., at 592.  We considered but rejected the common-law definition, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe contemporary understanding of \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 has diverged a long way from its common-law roots.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 593.  Ultimately, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress meant by \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 598.  To determine that sense, we looked for guidance to W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) and the American Law Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Model Penal Code (1980).  We defined \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 599.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In defining \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ACCA, I would follow the same approach.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt common law, extortion was a property offense committed by a public official who took \xe2\x80\x98any money or thing of value\xe2\x80\x99 that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scheidler</em> v. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/393/index.html">537 U. S. 393</a>, 402 (2003) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141 (1769), and citing 3 R. Anderson, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law and Procedure \xc2\xa71393, pp.\xc2\xa0790\xe2\x80\x93791 (1957)); see also 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa720.4 (2d ed. 2003).  As with burglary, however, modern conceptions of extortion have gone well beyond the common-law understanding.  In the Hobbs Act, for example, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly \xe2\x80\x98expanded the common-law definition of extortion to include acts by private individuals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scheidler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 402 (quoting <em>Evans</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/255/index.html">504 U. S. 255</a>, 261 (1992)).  And whereas the Hobbs Act retained the common-law requirement that something of value actually be <em>acquired</em> by the extortionist, <em>Scheidler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 404\xe2\x80\x93405, the majority of state statutes require only \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant make a threat with <em>intent</em> thereby to acquire the victim\xe2\x80\x99s property,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa720.4(a)(1), at 199 (emphasis added).  Further, under most state statutes, the category of qualifying threats has expanded dramatically, to include threats to: \xe2\x80\x9ckill the victim in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccause economic harm,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully detain,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caccuse the victim of a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpose some disgraceful defect or secret of the victim which, when known, would subject him to public ridicule or disgrace,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimpair one\xe2\x80\x99s credit or business repute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa720.4(a)(4), at 200, 201.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Model Penal Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cTheft by Extortion\xe2\x80\x9d reflects this expansive modern notion of the crime:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA person is guilty of theft [by extortion] if he purposely obtains property of another by threatening to:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other criminal offense; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82accuse anyone of a criminal offense; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3)\xe2\x80\x82expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(4)\xe2\x80\x82take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(5)\xe2\x80\x82bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective unofficial action, if the property is not demanded or received for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor purports to act; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(6)\xe2\x80\x82testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another\xe2\x80\x99s legal claim or defense; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(7)\xe2\x80\x82inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7223.4.</p>\n<p align="left">\nOther federal statutes, including the Hobbs Act, 18 U.

See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nardello</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/286/index.html">393 U. S. 286</a> (1969) (Travel Act); <em>Scheidler</em>, <em>supra</em> (Hobbs Act and RICO).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The word \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d cannot, however, incorporate the full panoply of threats that would qualify under the Model Penal Code, many of which are inherently nonviolent.  I arrive at this conclusion for two reasons: First, another canon of statutory construction, <em>noscitur a sociis</em>, which counsels that \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning of an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1084; see <em>Keffeler</em>, 537 U. S., at 384\xe2\x80\x93385.  Of course <em>noscitur a sociis</em> is just an erudite (or some would say antiquated) way of saying what common sense tells us to be true: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] word is known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jarecki</em> v. <em>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/303/index.html">367 U. S. 303</a>, 307 (1961)\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, which of various possible meanings a word should be given must be determined in a manner that makes it \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d with the words with which it is closely associated.  The words immediately surrounding \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) are \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9carson,\xe2\x80\x9d and crimes \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[ing] use of explosives.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Model Penal Code\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping definition of extortion would sit uncomfortably indeed amidst this list of crimes which, as the \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d residual provision makes plain, are characterized by their potential for violence and their risk of physical harm to others.  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s usage of \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d differs from the context in which the word appears in the Travel Act, where it is one of a list of crimes \xe2\x80\x9coften used by organized crime to collect \xe2\x80\xa6 revenue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nardello</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 291, n.\xc2\xa08, including bribery.  And it differs from the context in which \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d appears in RICO, where it is part of a laundry list of nearly every federal crime under the sun.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is suggested by the canon is reinforced by the fact that both the original common-law notion of extortion, and the full expanse of the modern definition, include crimes so inherently <em>unlikely</em> to cause physical harm that it would set the bar of the residual provision at a level that could embrace virtually any offense\xe2\x80\x94making the limitation to \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d utterly incomprehensible.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.  I therefore assume that extortion under ACCA is: the obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another.  Cf. <em>Leocal</em>, 543 U. S., at 13 (discussing the relationship between the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of force against the person or property of another\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] of violence under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One final consideration is worthy of mention.  I must make sure that my restricted definition of generic extortion does not render the inclusion of extortion in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) superfluous in light of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Clause (i) already includes in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d any crime that \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  My narrow definition of extortion passes the surplusage test only if it includes crimes that would not be covered by this provision.  That is not a problem, since my definition includes the use or threatened use of force against property, whereas clause (i) is limited to force against the person.  Thus, the obtaining of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s money by threatening to wreck his place of business would fit within clause (ii) but not within clause (i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having defined burglary and extortion, I return to the question that launched this investigation in the first place: Which of the two poses the least \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d?  Recall the definitions: burglary is the \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime\xe2\x80\x9d; extortion is \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or property of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Every victim of extortion is the object of a threat, to his person or his property; if he ignores that threat, or resists it by seeking to protect his property, he may be harmed.  Burglary, on the other hand, involves only the <em>possibility</em> that a confrontation will take place while the crime is underway; the risk of physical harm can become a reality only if the property owner happens to be present, a situation which the burglar ordinarily seeks to avoid.  The extortionist, moreover, has already expressed his willingness to commit a violent act; the burglar may be prepared to flee at the first sign of human presence.  I think it obvious that burglary is less inherently risky than extortion, and thus the least inherently risky of the four crimes enumerated in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A that a crime may qualify under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s violent felony residual provision only if it poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as the least risky of the enumerated crimes; and in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B that the least risky of the enumerated crimes is burglary; I am finally able to turn to the ultimate question posed by this case: Does <em>attempted</em> burglary categorically qualify as a violent felony under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision?  Or as my analysis has recast that question, does attempted burglary categorically involve conduct that poses at least as much risk of physical injury to another as completed burglary?  Contrary to what the Court says, <em>ante, </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9313, the answer must be no.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Taylor</em>, we discussed the risks posed by the conduct involved in a completed burglary.  We found it significant that a burglary involves \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of victims\xe2\x80\x99 homes or workplaces,\xe2\x80\x9d 495 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), and we dwelled on such an invasion\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinherent potential for harm to persons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 588.  In comparing attempted burglary to completed burglary, the Court focuses almost exclusively on \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.  But it ignores numerous other factors that make a completed burglary far more dangerous than a failed one: the closer proximity between burglar and victim where a confrontation takes place inside the confined space of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s home; the greater likelihood of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s initiating violence inside his home to protect his family and property; the greater likelihood that any confrontation inside the home will be between the burglar and the <em>occupant</em> of the home, rather than the <em>police</em>.  The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cconfrontation\xe2\x80\x9d the Court envisions between a would-be burglar and a third party while the burglar is still <em>outside </em>the home is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s yelling \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d from his window, and the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s running away.  It is simply not the case, as the Court apparently believes, that would-be home entries are often reduced to <em>attempted</em> home entries by <em>physical confrontation</em> between homeowner and criminal while the latter is still outside the house.  (One must envision a householder throwing open his front door, shotgun in hand, just as the would-be burglar is trying to pick the lock.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have previously stated, it is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that an offender <em>enters</em> a building to commit a crime [that] creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor, supra, </em>at 588 (emphasis added); see also <em>Leocal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]urglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim <em>in completing the crime</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  By definition, a perpetrator who has been convicted only of attempted burglary has failed to make it inside the home or workplace.  (Indeed, a criminal convicted only of attempted burglary almost certainly injured no one; otherwise, he would have been convicted of something far more serious, such as assault or murder.)  Thus, the full extent of the risk that burglary poses\xe2\x80\x94the entry into the home that makes burglary such a threat to the physical safety of its victim\xe2\x80\x94is necessarily absent in attempted burglary, however \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d is defined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because attempted burglary categorically poses a less \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d than burglary, the least risky of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated crimes, I would hold that it cannot be a predicate \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement, \xc2\xa7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), regardless of how close a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt statute requires the perpetrator come to completing the underlying offense.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court observes, with undoubted accuracy, that my approach is not perfect.  It leaves it to courts to decide, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout hard statistics\xe2\x80\x9d to guide them, <em>ante</em>, at 16, the degree of risk of physical injury posed by various crimes.  But this is an imponderable that cannot be avoided when dealing with a statute that turns upon \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  It inheres in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s puny solution as well (how does the Court know that attempted burglary poses the same risk as burglary?).  What this dissent must establish is not that my solution is perfect, but that it is substantially better than what the Court proposes.  And there is little doubt of that.  For <em>in addition</em> to leaving up in the air for judicial determination how much risk of physical injury each crime presents, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s uninformative opinion leaves open, to be guessed at by lower courts and by those subjected to this law: (1) whether the degree of risk covered by the residual provision is limited by the degrees of risk presented by the enumerated crimes;[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] (2) if so, whether extortion is to be given its broadest meaning, which would embrace crimes with virtually no risk of physical injury; and most importantly (3) where in the world to set the <em>minimum</em> risk of physical injury that will qualify.  This indeed leaves the lower courts and those subject to this law to sail upon a virtual sea of doubt.  The <em>only</em> thing the Court decides (and that, in my view, erroneously) is that attempted burglary poses the same risk of physical injury as burglary, and hence is covered without the need to address these other bothersome questions (how wonderfully\nconvenient!).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is only the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision-averse solution that enables it to accuse me of \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessarily decid[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of extortion, <em>ante, </em>at 15.  The Court accurately, but quite irrelevantly, asserts the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if an unenumerated offense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk as the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be necessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to decide this case.  Rather, it would be sufficient to establish simply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much risk as <em>one</em> of the enumerated offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThat is true enough, and I would be properly criticized for reaching an unnecessary question if, like the Court, I found attempted burglary to be as risky as burglary.  Since I do not, however, it is unavoidable that I determine the meaning of extortion, in order to decide whether attempted burglary is less risky than <em>that.</em>  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s criticism amounts to nothing more than a procedural quibble: Instead of deciding, as I have, (1) that attempted burglary is clearly less risky than arson or use of explosives, (2) that of the remaining two enumerated crimes burglary is the less risky, and then (3) that attempted burglary is less risky than burglary, I should have followed step (1) with step (3), and only then have proceeded to determine the meaning of extortion.  Perhaps so, but it is surely a distinction without a real-world difference.  Under either approach, determining the meaning of extortion is unquestionably <em>necessary.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress passed ACCA to enhance punishment for gun-wielding offenders who have, inter alia</em>, previously committed crimes that pose a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress provided examples of crimes that meet this eminently reasonable but entirely abstract condition.  Unfortunately, however, the four examples have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury they pose.  Such shoddy draftsmanship puts courts to a difficult choice: They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, see n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra;</em> (2) apply it case-by-case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness, see <em>Kolender</em>, 461 U. S., at 357; <em>Lanzetta</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/451/index.html">306 U. S. 451</a>, 453 (1939).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would choose either the third option (which I have tried to implement) or the fourth, since I believe the first two to be impermissible.  If Congress wanted the first\xe2\x80\x94subjecting <em>all</em> repeat offenders to a 15-year mandatory minimum prison term\xe2\x80\x94it could very easily have crafted a statute which said that.  ACCA, with its tedious definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d was obviously not meant to have such an effect.  The second option (the one chosen by the Court today)\xe2\x80\x94essentially leaving it to the courts to apply the vague language in a manner that is <em>ex ante </em>(if not at the end of the day) highly unpredictable\xe2\x80\x94violates, in my view, the constitutional prohibition against vague criminal laws.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Congress has simply abdicated its responsibility when it passes a criminal statute insusceptible of an interpretation that enables principled, predictable application; and this Court has abdicated its responsibility when it allows that.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion permits an unintelligible criminal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unexplained.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court imprecisely identifies the common characteristic of the enumerated offenses, and therefore the defining characteristic of the residual provision, as crimes that \xe2\x80\x9ccreate significant risks of bodily injury or <em>confrontation</em> that might result in bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (emphasis added).  Of course, adding the word \xe2\x80\x9cconfrontation\xe2\x80\x9d is a convenient way of shoehorning attempted burglary into the ambit of the residual provision, but it is an invention entirely divorced from the statutory text.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Hobbs Act contains its own definition of extortion: \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71951(b)(2).  In <em>Nardello</em> and <em>Scheidler</em>\xe2\x80\x94where we were required to define generic extortion for purposes of the Travel Act and RICO, both of which leave the term undefined\xe2\x80\x94we defined it as \xe2\x80\x9cobtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scheidler</em>, 537 U.

See <em>United States</em> v. <em>DeLuca</em>, 17 F.\xc2\xa03d 6, 8 (CA1 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe linchpin of [appellant\xe2\x80\x99s] theory is the suggestion that all extortions are not equal. \xe2\x80\xa6 [W]e give appellant high marks for ingenuity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Anderson</em>, 989 F.\xc2\xa02d 310, 312 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cDetermin[ing] whether a crime [is a violent felony] \xe2\x80\xa6 is not, with regard to \xe2\x80\x98extortion,\xe2\x80\x99 an easy matter.  In <em>Taylor</em>, the Court focused on the interstate consensus on the definition of \xe2\x80\x98burglary,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 but there\xe2\x80\x99s no such consensus on extortion\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know which definition the legislators who voted for [ACCA] had in mind.  Quite likely most of them weren\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of any particular definition at all\xe2\x80\x9d).  These Courts ultimately decided to use different definitions\nof extortion.  See <em>DeLuca</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 9 (deciding on the Model Penal Code approach); <em>Anderson, supra,</em> at 313 (deciding on the Hobbs Act definition).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court explains, for example, that modern extortion could include \xe2\x80\x9can anonymous blackmailer threaten[ing] to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments,\xe2\x80\x9d a crime involving a \xe2\x80\x9crisk of physical injury to another approach[ing] zero.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  Thus, were the complete modern notion of extortion adopted, it is clear that extortion would be the least risky of the four enumerated crimes.  That would mean that any crime posing at least as much risk of physical injury as extortion would qualify under the ACCA residual provision.  But virtually any crime could qualify, so that courts would have the power to subject almost any repeat offender to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s 15-year mandatory minimum.  Indeed, this seems to be the reality of what is taking place in the lower courts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 990 (CA8 2005) (operating a dump truck without consent of the owner is a violent felony under ACCA); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Springfield</em>, 196 F.\xc2\xa03d 1180 (CA10 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cwalkaway\xe2\x80\x9d escape from prison honor camp is a violent felony under ACCA).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0There is no need to apply the modified categorical approach in this case.  Under that approach, the most the Government could achieve would be to narrow the type of Florida burglary underlying James\xe2\x80\x99s conviction so that it falls within generic ACCA burglary.  As I discussed above, however, even the attempt to commit a generic ACCA burglary could not qualify as a violent felony under ACCA.  Thus, there is no need to remand; the Eleventh Circuit should simply be reversed.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court plays with this question, but does not resolve it, merely stating that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility that an offense may present \xe2\x80\x98a serious risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x99 without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Of course, in light of its ultimate conclusion regarding attempted burglary, the Court could <em>not</em> resolve this question without being guilty of what it accuses me of: \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessarily decid[ing] an important question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15; any pronouncement on this point would be pure dictum.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court contends that the provision at issue here, even when left entirely unexplained (as today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion skillfully accomplishes) cannot be unconstitutionally vague, because \xe2\x80\x9c[s]imilar formulations have been used in other federal and state criminal statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, n. 6.  None of the provisions the Court cites, however, is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshades of red,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfire-engine red, light pink, maroon, <em>navy blue</em>, or colors that otherwise involve shades of red\xe2\x80\x9d assuredly does so. </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962407">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n550 U.
