In view of the conflict between the circuit courts of appeals, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.  268 U.S. 684.</p>\n<p>At the hearing below, all attention seems to have been concentrated on the question passed upon and the forcibly stated reasons that induced this court of appeals to differ from that, for the Sixth Circuit.  But, upon a closer scrutiny of the bill than seems to have been invited before, it does not present that broad and interesting issue.  The bill alleges that the plaintiff has a patent for an explosion chamber "as described and claimed in said letters patent;" that it has the exclusive right to make and sell "safes containing such an explosion chamber;" that no other safes containing "such an explosion chamber" could be got in the United States before the defendant, as it is alleged, infringed the plaintiff\'s patent, for which alleged infringement a suit is pending.  It then is alleged that the defendant is making and selling safes with a metal band around the door at substantially the same location as the explosion chamber of plaintiff\'s safes, and has represented to the public "that the said metal band was employed to cover or close an explosion chamber," by reason of which</p>\n<p>"the public has been led to purchase </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 273 U. S. 134</a></p><p> defendant\'s said safes as and for safes containing an explosion chamber, such as is manufactured and sold by the plaintiff herein."</p>\n<p>It is alleged further that sometimes the defendant\'s safes have no explosion chamber under the band, but are bought by those who want safes with a chamber, and so the defendant has deprived the plaintiff of sales, competed unfairly, and damaged the plaintiff\'s reputation.  The plaintiff relies upon its patent suit for relief in respect of the sales of safes alleged to infringe its rights.  It complains here only of false representations as to safes that do not infringe, but that are sold as having explosion chambers although in fact they do not.</p>\n<p>It is consistent with every allegation in the bill, and the defendant, in argument, asserted it to be a fact, that there are other safes with explosion chambers beside that for which the plaintiff has a patent.  The defendant is charged only with representing that its safes had an explosion chamber, which, so far as appears, it had a perfect right to do if the representation was true.  If, on the other hand, the representation was false, as it is alleged sometimes to have been, there is nothing to show that customers, had they known the facts, would have gone to the plaintiff, rather than to other competitors in the market, or to lay a foundation for the claim for a loss of sales.  The bill is so framed as to seem to invite the decision that was obtained from the circuit court of appeals, but, when scrutinized, is seen to have so limited its statements as to exclude the right to complain.</p>\n<p><em>Decree reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
