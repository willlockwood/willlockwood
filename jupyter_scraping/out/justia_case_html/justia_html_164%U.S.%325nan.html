S. 327</a></p><p> mining claim until the patent had been issued, following in this particular <em>King v. Thomas,</em> 6 Mont. 409, and second that the matters alleged as an estoppel having taken place before the time the plaintiffs made their application for a patent, and notice of such application having been given, that all adverse claimants were given an opportunity of contesting the applicant\'s right to a patent, and that, the patent having been issued, it was too late to base a defense upon facts existing prior thereto, citing in support of its position a prior ruling of the court in <em>Talbott v. King,</em> 6 Mont. 76.</p>\n<p>Neither of these defenses presents a federal question.  Defendants asserted no right under a federal statute, made no claim under any federal patent, claimed solely under a statute of limitations, which the highest court of the state declared did not protect them, and certain matters of alleged estoppel <em>in pais,</em> which the court held to constitute no defense.</p>\n<p>The writ of error must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
