Under an \xe2\x80\x9cenriched uranium product\xe2\x80\x9d (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the enricher cash for LEU of a desired quantity and \xe2\x80\x9cassay,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> its percentage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction.  The amount of energy required to enrich a quantity of \xe2\x80\x9cfeed uranium\xe2\x80\x9d to a given assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a \xe2\x80\x9cseparative work unit\xe2\x80\x9d (SWU).  Under a \xe2\x80\x9cSWU contract,\xe2\x80\x9d the utility provides a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to produce the required LEU quantity and assay.  SWU contracts do not require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the utility\xe2\x80\x99s uranium.  Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an enrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from the enricher\xe2\x80\x99s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility provided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium enrichment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce Department (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which calls for \xe2\x80\x9cantidumping\xe2\x80\x9d duties on \xe2\x80\x9cforeign merchandise\xe2\x80\x9d sold in this country at \xe2\x80\x9cless than its fair value,\xe2\x80\x9d 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71673, but does not touch international sales of services.  USEC alleged that LEU imported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was materially harming domestic industry.  In its final determination, the Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU acquired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair value.  Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in SWU contracts.  The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately reversed, noting the \xe2\x80\x9clegal fiction\xe2\x80\x9d expressed in SWU contracts that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility.  Finding that the record did not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership rights, the CIT reasoned that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law.  The Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT had.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Department\xe2\x80\x99s take on the transactions at issue as sales of goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and application of \xc2\xa71673.  Because \xc2\xa71677(1) gives this determination to the Department in the first instance, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>.  Two threshold propositions must be accepted.  First, the Department reasonably concluded that \xc2\xa71673 is not limited by its terms to cash-only sales.  If that were the case, any sale of a manufactured product could be exempted from the section\xe2\x80\x99s operation by a contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a commodity.  Second, since public law is not constrained by private fiction, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Tcherepnin</em> v. <em>Knight</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/332/index.html">389 U. S. 332</a>,  336, the Department is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility.  Thus, the test of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s position turns first on whether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the utility provides.  Although it is undisputed that \xc2\xa71673 applies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it applies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.  This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative agency for a decision about a statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Once the choice is made, the Court asks only whether the Department\xe2\x80\x99s application of the statute was reasonable.  Where, as here, cash plus an untracked fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably treat the transaction as the sale of a good under \xc2\xa71673.  Cf. <em>Powder Co.</em> v. <em>Burkhardt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/97/110/index.html">97 U. S. 110</a>, 116.  The Department\xe2\x80\x99s position is reinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping duties\xe2\x80\x99 effectiveness.  It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value.  Such a transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to material injury, the very threat that \xc2\xa71673 was meant to counter.  But the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable.  Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in exchange for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it.  And the restructuring would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise the uncreative.  The Department\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to foreclose this absurd result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently reasonable.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71673, but does not touch international sales of services.  These cases test the application of this antidumping provision to imports of low enriched uranium (LEU), a highly processed derivative of natural uranium used as nuclear fuel, when domestic utilities contract to obtain LEU for cash plus unenriched uranium delivered to a foreign enricher.  Although the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contracts call these transactions sales of uranium enrichment services, the Commerce Department treats them as sales of \xe2\x80\x9cforeign merchandise\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the antidumping provision.  The issue is whether the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s way of seeing the transactions as sales of goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and application of \xc2\xa71673.  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are five steps in transforming elemental uranium into fuel rods for nuclear powerplants.  After uranium ore is mined, it is milled into uranium concentrate called \xe2\x80\x9cyellowcake,\xe2\x80\x9d which is next converted into uranium hexafluoride gas or \xe2\x80\x9cfeed uranium.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fissionable isotope in unenriched feed uranium is then concentrated, producing LEU in pellet form, which is in turn made into uranium fuel rods.  These cases are about the fourth step: enriching uranium feedstock into LEU.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The uranium isotope needed for a nuclear reaction, U-235, amounts only to .711 percent by weight of natural uranium.  Uranium whose concentration or \xe2\x80\x9cassay,\xe2\x80\x9d of U-235 has been enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), whereas LEU has a U-235 assay of 3 to 5 percent, making it useful as nuclear fuel.  One way to produce LEU, and the method at issue in these cases, is gaseous diffusion,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] whereby gaseous feed uranium is pushed through a long series of filters, separating the gas into two streams.  The stream passing through the filters (the \xe2\x80\x9cproduct stream\xe2\x80\x9d) gains a higher concentration of the lighter U-235<font super="-1"> isotope than the stream that is filtered out (the \xe2\x80\x9ctails\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the concentration reached at each individual filter is minor, the gas must be forced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at great expenditure of electricity, before the product stream reaches the desired assay.  The amount of energy required to enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is measured in terms of an industry standard called a \xe2\x80\x9cseparative work unit\xe2\x80\x9d or SWU (pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cswoo\xe2\x80\x9d).  In practice, however, a given degree of enrichment will depend on adjusting the quantities of two separate variables, feed uranium and electricity, in inverse proportions.  Thus, if the electric rate is stable but the value of feed uranium falls, an enricher may produce LEU by \xe2\x80\x9coverfeeding,\xe2\x80\x9d subjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium to fewer SWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and electricity does not, \xe2\x80\x9cunderfeeding\xe2\x80\x9d can use more SWUs to squeeze extra U-235<font super="-1"> from the tails.</font></font></p><font super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nuclear utilities generally get LEU in one of two ways. Under an \xe2\x80\x9cenriched uranium product\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cEUP\xe2\x80\x9d contract, a utility simply buys a desired quantity and assay of LEU for cash.  Under a \xe2\x80\x9cSWU contract,\xe2\x80\x9d the utility provides a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to produce the quantity and assay of LEU called for.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Despite their name, SWU contracts do not require that the contractual number of SWUs actually be applied to the quantity of uranium provided,<em> </em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Low Enriched Uranium From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65877, 65884 (2001) (hereinafter LEU from France); rather, the enricher remains free to overfeed or underfeed so long as it delivers the specified LEU.  Moreover, because feed uranium is fungible, and \xe2\x80\x9cfor all intents and purposes, trades like a commodity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>and because profitable operation of an enrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from the enricher\xe2\x80\x99s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility provided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, USEC Inc. and its subsidiary, United States Enrichment Corporation, (USEC collectively) run the only uranium enrichment factory in the United States,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] which was built by the United States Government in the 1950s and\xc2\xa0run by various federal agencies until it was leased to USEC in 1998.

Reg. 65882\xe2\x80\x9365883.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its final determination, the Commerce Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU acquired under SWU contracts, was being sold, or likely to be sold, in the United States at less than fair value.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 65878.  In deciding that SWU contracts are for a sale of LEU, not enrichment services, the Department stressed several features of the transactions.  First, because the enrichment process accounts for approximately 60 percent of the value of LEU and works a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial transformation\xe2\x80\x9d on uranium feedstock, <em>id.</em>, at 65881, enrichment creates \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential character\xe2\x80\x9d of LEU, <em>id.</em>, at 65884.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cenrichers not only have complete control over the enrichment process, but in fact control the level of usage of the natural uranium provided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Third, the utilities themselves take no part in the manufacture of LEU and are the sole purchasers of the product.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commerce Department also rejected the argument that LEU transferred pursuant to SWU contracts should not be considered \xe2\x80\x9csold\xe2\x80\x9d in light of a \xe2\x80\x9ctolling\xe2\x80\x9d regulation then (but no longer) in effect.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The regulation stated that a \xe2\x80\x9ctoller,\xe2\x80\x9d a subcontractor who sells processing services in, or material for incorporation into, subject merchandise, would not be considered a manufacturer or producer \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the toller or subcontractor does not acquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of the subject merchandise.\xe2\x80\x9d  19 CFR \xc2\xa7351.401(h) (2000) (withdrawn in Import Administration, Withdrawal of Regulations Governing the Treatment of Subcontractors, (\xe2\x80\x9cTolling\xe2\x80\x9d Operations), 73 Fed.

This regulation, the Commerce Department explained, was intended to apply in situations where a good is first sold by a manufacturer and then resold by an exporter or reseller.  LEU from France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65880.  The regulation provides that in such a situation the second sale should be used to calculate the U.\xe2\x80\x82S. price and normal value of the manufactured good; however, the Commerce Department concluded, the regulation was not meant to preclude antidumping duties where a manufacturer makes the only relevant sale that can be used to establish U.\xe2\x80\x82S. price and normal value.  <em>Ibid.; id.,</em> at 65884\xe2\x80\x9365885.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Commerce Department reasoned that language in SWU contracts speaking of the transactions as the sale of enrichment services could not control, lest deferring to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 characterizations allow them to \xe2\x80\x9cconvert trade in goods into trade in so-called \xe2\x80\x98manufacturing services,\xe2\x80\x99 . . . thereby exposing industries to injury by unfair trade practices without the remedy of the [antidumping] laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 65881.

While the court conceded that SWU agreements \xe2\x80\x9cdo \xe2\x80\x98not fall neatly\xe2\x80\x99 either into the category of contracts for services or the category of contracts for the sale of goods,\xe2\x80\x9d 411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1364 (quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1373\xe2\x80\x931374), it still concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ceven under the deferential standard of review that we apply in this case, we choose not to ignore our previous holdings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eurodif I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1363.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after this decision<em>,</em> we held in <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U.

On rehearing, the Federal Circuit responded to <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association </em>by explaining that it had not rejected the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s position because it conflicted with the prior interpretive choice that carried the day in <em>Florida Power &amp; Light.</em> <em>Eurodif S.\xe2\x80\x82A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 1275, 1277\xe2\x80\x931278<em> </em>(2005) <em>(Eurodif II)</em>.  The Circuit, rather, saw no statutory uncertainty to be resolved: \xe2\x80\x9cthe antidumping duty statute unambiguously applies to the sale of goods and not services\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit is clear that [SWU] contracts are contracts for services and not goods.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1278<em>.</em>  After final judgment was entered, <em>Eurodif S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 506 F.\xc2\xa03d 1051, 1053 (CA Fed. 2007) <em>(Eurodif III)</em>, we granted certiorari 553 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71673, the better view is that a SWU contract is one for the sale of services, not goods.  The statute gives this determination to the Department of Commerce in the first instance, \xc2\xa71677(1), and when the Department exercises this authority in the course of adjudication, its interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

First, we think the Department reasonably concluded that \xc2\xa71673 is not limited by its terms to cash-only sales.  Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product could be exempted from the operation of \xc2\xa71673 by a contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a commodity.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in applying \xc2\xa71673, the Commerce Department is not bound by the \xe2\x80\x9clegal fiction [created by SWU contracts] that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>USEC</em>, 281 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1339.  The parties are free to contract as they wish, and they may genuinely regard SWU agreements as contracts for the sale of enrichment services.  But, whatever the significance of such a term in a contract dispute, cf<em>. Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</em>, 307 F.\xe2\x80\x823d 1364, it is well settled that in reading regulatory and taxation statutes, \xe2\x80\x9cform should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tcherepnin</em> v. <em>Knight</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/332/index.html">389 U. S. 332</a>, 336 (1967).  See also <em>Frank Lyon Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/561/index.html">435 U.

Lazarus &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/252/index.html">308 U. S. 252</a>, 255 (1939))).  Surrender to private contractual terms is especially uncalled for in dealing with international tariffs, as Congress saw when it amended the Tariff Act to say that the sale of foreign merchandise includes \xe2\x80\x9cthe entering into of any leasing arrangement regarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of the merchandise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, \xc2\xa7602(b)(2), 98 Stat. 3024, 19 U. S.C. \xc2\xa71673.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since public law is not constrained by private fiction, the test of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s position turns first on whether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the utility provides.  No one disputes<font b="1"> that \xc2\xa71673 applies to the sale of goods, not services, LEU From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65882\xe2\x80\x9365883.  Nor do we think anyone would deny that the exchange of cash combined with a commodity for a product that uses that very commodity as a constituent material is sometimes a sale of services and sometimes a sale of goods, the distinction being clear at the extremes.<font b="1">  A customer who comes to a laundry with cash and dirty shirts is clearly purchasing cleaning services, not clean shirts.  And a customer who provides cash and sand to a manufacturer of generic silicon processors is clearly\nbuying computer chips rather than sand enhancement services.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the line blurs when the facts get more complicated, and SWU contracts exemplify a class of transactions that the Federal Circuit recognized does \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not fall neatly\xe2\x80\x99 either into the category of contracts for services or the category of contracts for the sale of goods.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eurodif I, </em>411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1364 (quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1373\xe2\x80\x931374).  The agreement is not like the laundry ticket, which says that the same shirts are supposed to come back, just minus the dirt around the collar.  And it is not on all fours with the agreement of the chip buyer and the manufacturer, in which it is inescapable that the silicon processors delivered are a separate good from the sand provided. Section 1673 simply does not speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it applies to the LEU and the agreement that gives the utility a right to get it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is the very situation in which we look to an authoritative agency for a decision about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope, which is defined in cases at the statutory margin by the agency\xe2\x80\x99s application of it, and once the choice is made we ask only whether the Department\xe2\x80\x99s application was reasonable.  As to that, the Commerce Department relied on two related characteristics of these transactions in deciding SWU contracts should be treated as a sale of LEU.  It stressed that the utility in a SWU contract provides cash plus a fungible commodity that is not tracked after its delivery to the enricher, in exchange for a product owned by the enricher.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  And it recognized that the enrichment process results in a substantial transformation of the unenriched uranium.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The combination of these characteristics reasonably captures a common understanding of the sale of a good.  Because an individual\xe2\x80\x99s shirts are not fungible, they are tracked during the cleaning process and returned to the same customer who brought them in; there are no good reasons to treat them as owned for a time by the laundry, and no one does.  And without any transfer of ownership, the salient feature of the transaction is the cleaning of the shirt, a service.  Conversely, where a constituent material is untracked and fungible, ownership is usually seen as transferred, and the transaction is less likely to be a sale of services, as the Court explained years ago in distinguishing a common-law bailment from a sale:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here logs are delivered to be sawed into boards, or leather to be made into shoes, rags into paper, olives into oil, grapes into wine, wheat into flour, if the product of the identical articles delivered is to be returned to the original owner in a new form, it is said to be a bailment, and the title never vests in the manufacturer.  If, on the other hand, the manufacturer is not bound to return the same wheat or flour or paper, but may deliver any other of equal value, it is said to be a sale or a loan, and the title to the thing delivered vests in the manufacturer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Powder Co.</em> v. <em>Burkhardt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/97/110/index.html">97 U. S. 110</a>, 116 (1878).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd when the manufacturer is not only free to return different material, but also substantially transforms the material it uses, it is even more likely that the object of the transaction will be seen as a new product, not work on enduring material of primary interest to the buyer.  After all, what makes the hypothetical exchange of sand\nfor silicon processors so obviously a sale of goods is the extreme transformation brought about by the chip\nmanufacturer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These are good analytical grounds to show that SWU transactions are reasonably placed within the ambit of sale of goods, and the Department\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on them is reinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving the effectiveness of antidumping duties.  There is no dispute that LEU sold under an EUP contract at less than fair value must be subjected to antidumping duties under \xc2\xa71673, there being a clear sale of goods when a domestic utility pays a single sale price in cash for the feed uranium and enrichment components represented by LEU.  If foreign enrichers set this price below the fair value of LEU, the domestic enrichment industry is obviously open to material injury, the very threat the antidumping statute was meant to counter, see H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1, at 23.  But the same injury would occur if a SWU contract were untouchable.  Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in exchange for LEU;<font b="1"> any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  And the restructuring would not stop with uranium; contracts for imported pasta would be replaced by separate contracts for wheat and wheat processing services, sweater imports would give way to separate contracts for wool and knitting services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise the uncreative.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to foreclose this absurd result by treating SWU transactions as sales of goods is eminently reasonable.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where a domestic buyer\xe2\x80\x99s cash and an untracked, fungible commodity are exchanged with a foreign contractor for a substantially transformed version of the same commodity, the Commerce Department may reasonably treat the transaction as the sale of a good under \xc2\xa71673.

While the precise form of this argument is unclear, it fails under any reading.  Respondents seem to mean that the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71673 is impermissible as being inconsistent with the formal terms of SWU contracts, an argument we rejected above.  The argument could also be read to suggest that the Commerce Department lacked substantial evidence to conclude that, contractual formalities aside, enrichers in fact own the LEU provided under SWU contracts prior to its delivery.  But the evidence in the record not only supports the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, it compels it.  It is undisputed that the LEU delivered under a SWU contract is not actually derived from the feed uranium provided as consideration; as CIT observed, the notion that the same feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility is \xe2\x80\x9ca legal fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>USEC Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 281 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1334, 1339 (2003).  Moreover, the enricher is free to vary the amount of feed uranium used to produce an order of LEU, either stockpiling feed uranium or supplementing its stores from other sources.  Finally, the SWU contracts at issue provide that the utility retains title to the feed uranium until delivery of the LEU, at which point it obtains title in the LEU.  In light of this process, some entity must own the LEU prior to delivery and obtain title to the feed uranium after delivery, absent some modern analog to the abhorrent possibility of an abeyance of seizen; the enricher is the only serious candidate.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Common law definitions do not necessarily control the meaning of terms in modern trade laws; we merely mean to show the long pedigree of the distinction relied upon by the Commerce Department.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This would be particularly easy in these cases, since COGEMA, Eurodif\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, \xe2\x80\x9cis a major world supplier of natural uranium for the production of LEU.\xe2\x80\x9d  Final Remand Determination, App. G to Pet. for Cert. 221a, n.\xe2\x80\x8238.
