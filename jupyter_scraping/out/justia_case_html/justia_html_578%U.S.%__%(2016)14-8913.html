The Guidelines range in his presentence report was 77 to 96 months.  He requested, and the Probation Office recommended, a 77-month sentence, while the Government requested 96 months.  The District Court, with little explanation, sentenced him to the lowest end of what it believed to be the applicable Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x9477 months.  On appeal, Molina-Martinez argued for the first time that the Probation Office and the District Court miscalculated his Guidelines range, which should have been 70 to 87 months, and noted that his 77-month sentence would have been in the middle of the correct range, not at the bottom.  The Fifth Circuit agreed that the District Court used an incorrect Guidelines range but found that Molina-Martinez could not satisfy Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the error affect his substantial rights.  It reasoned that a defendant whose sentence falls within what would have been the correct Guidelines range must, on appeal, identify \xe2\x80\x9cadditional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d showing that use of the incorrect Guidelines range in fact affected his sentence<b>.</b></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Courts reviewing Guidelines errors cannot apply a categorical \xe2\x80\x9cadditional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d rule in cases, like this one, where a district court applies an incorrect range but sentences the defendant within the correct range.

Sentencing Commission statistics confirm that the Guidelines inform and instruct the district court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of an appropriate sentence.  In the usual case, the systemic function of the selected Guidelines range will affect a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  As a result, a defendant who shows that the district court mistakenly deemed applicable an incorrect, higher range will, in the ordinary case, have demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different outcome.

This demonstrates that the Guidelines served as the starting point for the sentencing and were the focal point for the proceedings that followed.  Given the sentence the District Court chose, and because the court said nothing to suggest that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines range, there is at least a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a different sentence had it known that 70 months was the lowest sentence the Commission deemed appropriate.

In sentencing petitioner, the District Court applied a Guidelines range higher than the applicable one.  The error went unnoticed by the court and the parties, so no timely objection was entered.  The error was first noted when, during briefing to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, petitioner himself raised the mistake.  The Court of Appeals refused to correct the error because, in its view, petitioner could not establish a reasonable probability that but for the error he would have received a different sentence.  Under that court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, if a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sentence falls within what would have been the correct Guidelines range, the defendant, on appeal, must identify \xe2\x80\x9cadditional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to show that use of the incorrect Guidelines range did in fact affect his sentence.  Absent that evidence, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, a defendant who is sentenced under an incorrect range but whose sentence is also within what would have been the correct range cannot demonstrate he has been prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Most Courts of Appeals have not adopted so rigid a standard.  Instead, in recognition of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 central role in sentencing, other Courts of Appeals have concluded that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s application of an incorrect Guidelines range can itself serve as evidence of an effect on substantial rights.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Sabillon-Umana</i>, 772 F.\xc2\xa03d 1328, 1333 (CA10 2014) (application of an erroneous Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98runs the risk of affecting the ultimate sentence <i>regardless of</i> whether the court ultimately imposes a sentence within or outside\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that range); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Vargem</i>, 747 F.\xc2\xa03d 724, 728\xe2\x80\x93729 (CA9 2014); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Story</i>, 503 F.\xc2\xa03d 436, 440 (CA6 2007).  These courts recognize that, in most cases, when a district court adopts an incorrect Guidelinesrange, there is a reasonable probability that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence would be different absent the error.  This Court granted certiorari to reconcile the difference in approaches.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Sentencing Guidelines provide the framework for the tens of thousands of federal sentencing proceedings that occur each year.

In that circumstance, because the defendant failed to object to the miscalculation, appellate review of the error is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rule 52, in both its parts, is brief.  It states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Harmless Error.

As required, the Probation Office prepared a presentence report that related Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s offense of conviction, his criminal history, his personal characteristics, and the available sentencing options.  The report also included the Probation Office\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of what it believed to be Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range.  The Probation Office calculated Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s total offense level as 21.  It concluded that Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history warranted 18 points, which included 11 points for five aggravated burglary convictions from 2011.  Those 18 criminal history points resulted in a criminal history category of VI.  That category, combined with an offense level of 21, resulted in a Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the sentencing hearing Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s counsel and the Government addressed the court.  The Government acknowledged that the Probation Office had \xe2\x80\x9crecommended the low end on this case, 77 months.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 30.  But, the prosecution told the court, it \xe2\x80\x9cdisagree[d] with that recommendation,\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9casking for a high end sentence of 96 months\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the top of the Guidelines range.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Like the Probation Office, counsel for Molina-Martinez urged the court to enter a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range.  Counsel asserted that \xe2\x80\x9c77 months is a severe sentence\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cafter the 77 months, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be deported with probably a special release term.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 32.  A sentence of 77 months, counsel continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis more than adequate to ensure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After hearing from the parties, the court stated it was adopting the presentence report\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings and Guidelines calculations.

Upon release from imprisonment, Defendant shall be placed on supervised release for a term of three years without supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,at 33.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court provided no further explanation for thesentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On appeal, Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s attorney submitted a brief pursuant to <i>Anders </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 738 (1967)\n.  The attorney explained that, in his opinion, there were no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal.  Molina-Martinez, however, submitted a <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i> response to his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Anders </i>brief.  In it he identified for the first time what he believed to be an error in the calculation of his criminal history points under the Guidelines.  The Court of Appeals concluded that Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s argument did not appear frivolous.  It directed his lawyer to file either a supplemental <i>Anders</i> brief or a brief on the merits of the Guidelines issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Molina-Martinez, through his attorney, filed a merits brief arguing that the Probation Office and the District Court erred in calculating his criminal history points, resulting in the application of a higher Guidelines range.  The error, Molina-Martinez explained, occurred because the Probation Office failed to apply \xc2\xa74A1.2(a)(2) of the Guidelines.  See USSG \xc2\xa74A1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2012).  That provision addresses how multiple sentences imposed on the same day are to be counted for purposes of determining a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history.  It instructs that, when prior sentences were imposed on the same day, they should be counted as a single sentence unless the offenses \xe2\x80\x9cwere separated by an intervening arrest (<i>i.e.,</i> the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report included five aggravated burglary convictions for which he had been sentenced on the same day.  The Probation Office counted each sentence separately, which resulted in the imposition of 11 criminal history points.  Molina-Martinez contended this was error because none of the offenses were separated by an intervening arrest and because he had been sentenced for all five burglaries on the same day.  Under a correct calculation, in his view, the burglaries should have resulted in 5 criminal history points instead of 11.  That would have lowered his criminal history category from VI to V.  The correct criminal history category, in turn, would have resulted in a Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months rather than 77 to 96 months.  Had the correct range been used, Molina-Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s 77-month sentence would have been in the middle of the range, not at the bottom.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Molina-Martinez acknowledged that, because he did not object in the District Court, he was entitled to relief only if he could satisfy Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  He nevertheless maintained relief was warranted because the error was plain, affected his substantial rights, and impugned the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals disagreed.  It held that Molina-Martinez had not established that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of an incorrect Guidelines range affected his substantial rights.  It reasoned that, when a correct sentencing range overlaps with an incorrect range, the reviewing court \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98do[es] not assume, in the absence of additional evidence, that the sentence [imposed] affects a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  588 Fed. Appx. 333, 335 (CA5 2014) (<i>per curiam</i>); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Blocker</i>, 612 F.\xc2\xa03d 413, 416 (CA5 2010).  Molina-Martinez, the court ruled, had not put forth the additional evidence necessary to show that the error affected his substantial rights.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe mere fact that the court sentenced Molina-Martinez to a low-end sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cis insufficient on its own to show that Molina-Martinez would have received a similar low-end sentence had the district court used the correct Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  588 Fed. Appx., at 335.

This is so even if the ultimate sentence falls within both the correct and incorrect range.

These realities have led the Court to observe that there is \xe2\x80\x9cconsider-able empirical evidence indicating that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>,<i> supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These sources confirm that the Guidelines are not only the starting point for most federal sentencing proceedings but also the lodestar.  The Guidelines inform and instruct the district court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of an appropriate sentence.  In the usual case, then, the systemic function of the selected Guidelines range will affect the sentence.  This fact is essential to the application of Rule 52(b) to a Guidelines error.  From the centrality of the Guidelines in the sentencing process it must follow that, when a defendant shows that the district court used an incorrect range, he should not be barred from relief on appeal simply because there is no other evidence that the sentencing outcome would have been different had the correct range been used.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In most cases a defendant who has shown that the district court mistakenly deemed applicable an incorrect, higher Guidelines range has demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different outcome.  And, again in most cases, that will suffice for relief if the other requirements of Rule 52(b) are met.  There may be instances when, despite application of an erroneous Guidelines range, a reasonable probability of prejudice does not exist.  The sentencing process is particular to each defendant, of course, and a reviewing court must consider the facts and circumstances of the case before it.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Davila</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur essential point is that particular facts and circumstances matter\xe2\x80\x9d).  The record in a case may show, for example, that the district court thought the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the Guidelines range.  Judges may find that some cases merit a detailed explanation of the reasons the selected sentence is appropriate.  And that explanation could make it clear that the judge based the sentence he or she selected on factors independent of the Guidelines.  The Government remains free to \xe2\x80\x9cpoin[t] to parts of the record\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including relevant statements by the judge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto counter any ostensible showing of prejudice the defendant may make.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vonn</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55,\n68 (2002)\n.  Where, however, the record is silent as to what the district court might have done had it considered the correct Guidelines range, the court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on an incorrect range in most instances will suffice to show an effect on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights.  Indeed, in the ordinary case a defendant will satisfy his burden to show prejudice by pointing to the application of an incorrect, higher Guidelines range and the sentence he received thereunder.  Absent unusual circumstances, he will not be required to show more.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule to the contrary fails to take account of the dynamics of federal sentencing.  In a significant number of cases the sentenced defendant will lack the additional evidence the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule would require, for sentencing judges often say little about the degree to which the Guidelines influenced their determination.  District courts, as a matter of course, use the Guidelines range to instruct them regarding the appropriate balance of the relevant federal sentencing factors.  This Court has told judges that they need not provide extensive explanations for within-Guidelines sentences because \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ircumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s own reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rita</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 356\xe2\x80\x93357.  In these situations, reviewing courts may presume that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is reason-able.  <i>Id.,</i> at 341.<i> </i>As a result, the cases where the Guidelines are most likely to have influenced the district court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision\xe2\x80\x94those where the court chose a sentence within what it believed to be the applicable Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94are also the cases least likely to provide the defendant with evidence of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 influence beyond the sentence itself.  The defendants in these cases should not be prevented by a categorical rule from establishing on appeal that there is a reasonable probability the Guidelines range applied by the sentencing court had an effect on their within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case illustrates the unworkable nature of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 additional evidence rule.  Here the court held that Molina-Martinez could not establish an effect on his substantial rights.  Yet the record points to a different conclusion.  The District Court said nothing specific about why it chose the sentence it imposed.  It merely \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[ed] the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. guideline applications in the presentence investigation report,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 33, which set the range at 77 to 96 months; rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument for a sentence at the top of the Guidelines range; and agreed with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for, and the Probation Office\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of, a sentence at the bottom of the range.  As intended, the Guidelines served as the starting point for the sentencing and were the focal point for the proceedings that followed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 77-month sentence the District Court selected is conspicuous for its position as the lowest sentence within what the District Court believed to be the applicable range.  As Molina-Martinez explained to the Court of Appeals, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s selection of a sentence at the bottom of the range, despite the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request for the maximum Guidelines sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cevinced an intention .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to give the minimum recommended by the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant in No. 13\xe2\x80\x9340324 (CA5), p. 18.  The District Court said nothing to suggest that it would have imposed a 77-month sentence regardless of the Guidelines range.  Given these circumstances, there is at least a reasonable probability that the District Court would have imposed a different sentence had it known that 70 months was in fact the lowest sentence the Commission deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government contends that permitting a defendant to establish prejudice through the fact of a Guidelines error alone eliminates the main difference between Rules 52(a) and 52(b)\xe2\x80\x94which party must prove whether the complained-of error had an effect.  Brief for United States 21.  As noted, Rule 52(a) states: \xe2\x80\x9cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  When a defendant makes a timely objection, the Government can rely on Rule 52(a) to argue that the error does not warrant correction because it was harmless.  Although Rules 52(a) and (b) both require an inquiry into whether the complained-of error was prejudicial, there is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one important difference\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d between the subparts\xe2\x80\x94under (b), but not (a), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 18 (quoting <i>Olano</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 734).  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, ruling for Molina-Martinez will require the Government to prove the harmlessness of every Guidelines error raised on appeal regardless of whether it was preserved.  Brief for United States 27\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The holding here does not lead to that result.  The decision today simply states that courts reviewing sentencing errors cannot apply a categorical rule requiring additional evidence in cases, like this one, where the district court applied an incorrect range but nevertheless sentenced the defendant within the correct range.  Rejection of that rule means only that a defendant can rely on the application of an incorrect Guidelines range to show an effect on his substantial rights.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government expresses concern over the judicial resources needed for the resentencing proceedings that might result from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  It is doubtful today\xe2\x80\x99s holding will result in much of an increased burden.  As already noted, today\xe2\x80\x99s holding is consistent with the approach taken by most Courts of Appeals.  See, <i>e.g., Sabillon-Umana</i>, 772 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1333 (collecting cases).  Yet only a small fraction of cases are remanded for resentencing because of Guidelines related errors.  See 2014 Sourcebook S\xe2\x80\x936, S\xe2\x80\x93153 (Tables 2 and 62) (of the roughly 75,000 cases sentenced in 2014, only 620 resulted in a remand for resentencing because of a statutory or Guidelines related error).  Under the <i>Olano </i>framework, appellate courts retain broad discretion in determining whether a remand for resentencing is necessary.  Courts have, for example, developed mechanisms short of a full remand to determine whether a district court in fact would have imposed a different sentence absent the error.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Currie</i>, 739 F.\xc2\xa03d 960, 967 (CA7 2014) (ordering \xe2\x80\x9climited remand so that the district judge [could] consider, and state on the record, whether she would have imposed the same sentence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. knowing that [the defendant] was subject to a five-year rather than a ten-year statutory minimum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even when a Court of Appeals does decide that resentencing is appropriate, \xe2\x80\x9ca remand for resentencing, while not costless, does not invoke the same difficulties as a remand for retrial does.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wernick</i>, 691 F.\xc2\xa03d 108, 117\xe2\x80\x93118 (CA2 2012); see also<i> Sabillon-Umana</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1334 (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9ccost of correction is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. small\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] remand for sentencing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require that a defendant be released or retried\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s concern about additional, burdensome procedures appears unfounded, and, in any event, does not warrant reading into Rule 52(b) a requirement that does not exist.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the ordinary case the Guidelines accomplish their purpose.  They serve as the starting point for the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision and anchor the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in selecting an appropriate sentence.  It follows, then, that in most cases the Guidelines range will affect the sentence.  When that is so, a defendant sentenced under an incorrect Guidelines range should be able to rely on that fact to show a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under the correct range.  That probability is all that is needed to establish an effect on substantial rights for purposes of obtaining relief under Rule 52(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3560885">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x938913</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">SAUL MOLINA-MARTINEZ, PETITIONER <i>v.</i>UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[April 20, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I agree with the Court that the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rigid approach to unpreserved Guidelines errors is incorrect.

Unlike the Court, however, I would not speculate about how often the reasonable probability test will be satisfied in future cases.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s predictions in dicta about how plain-error review will play out are predicated on the view that sentencing judges will continue to rely very heavily on the Guidelines in the future, but that prediction may not turn out to be accurate.  We should not make predictions about the future effects of Guidelines errors, particularly since some may misunderstand those predictions as veiled directives.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x99 or a right of any other sort, \xe2\x80\x98may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before the tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Olano</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725,\n731 (1993)\n (quoting <i>Yakus</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n321 U.\xc2\xa0S. 414,\n444 (1944)\n).  Consistent with this principle, Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure treats defendants who preserve their claims much more favorably than those who fail to register a timely objection.  When the defendant has made a timely objection to an error, the Government generally bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless.  <i>Olano</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 734.  By contrast, when a defendant has failed to make a timely objection, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>id.</i>, at 741\xe2\x80\x93742 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This framework applies to errors in the calculation of an advisory Guidelines sentence.

Rather, the Fifth Circuit would require a defendant to produce direct evidence, such as an \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit statement suggesting that the Guidelines range was a primary factor in sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But there is no good reason to preclude defendants from showing prejudice via the type of circumstantial evidence at issue here.  As this case illustrates, the manner in which a district court applies an incorrect Guidelines range can itself serve as evidence of an effect on substantial rights.

Absent unusual circumstances, he will not be required to show more\xe2\x80\x9d).  For several reasons, however, I do not think the opinion can be fairly viewed as requiring such a result.  First, the Court makes clear that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does <i>not </i>shift the burden of persuasion from a forfeiting defendant to the Government.  See <i>ante</i>, at 14 (Under Rule 52(b), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he holding here does not\xe2\x80\x9d shift the burden).  Second, the opinion acknowledges that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on an incorrect range\xe2\x80\x9d will not always \xe2\x80\x9csuffice to show an effect on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even where \xe2\x80\x9cthe record is silent as to what the district court might have done had it considered the correct Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  It follows that even where the Government fails to identify <i>any</i> direct evidence of harmlessness, the defendant cannot automatically satisfy his burden simply by pointing to the application of an incorrect Guidelines range.  Instead of employing a strict presumption against the Government, the Court emphasizes, \xe2\x80\x9ca reviewing court must consider the facts and circumstances of the case before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>ibid. </i>(\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Our essential point is that particular facts and circumstances matter\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Davila</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13))).  Given these caveats, I do not read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as replacing the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible pro-Government presumption with an equally inflexible pro-defendant presumption.  Rather, I take the Court at its word: \xe2\x80\x9cThe decision today simply states that courts reviewing sentencing errors cannot apply a categorical rule requiring additional evidence in cases, like this one, where the district court applied an incorrect range but nevertheless sentenced the defendant within the correct range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.   \n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>Assessing <i>Booker</i> and Its Aftermath, Practice Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \xc2\xa71.02(C)(1), pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x9314 to 1\xe2\x80\x9316 (D.
