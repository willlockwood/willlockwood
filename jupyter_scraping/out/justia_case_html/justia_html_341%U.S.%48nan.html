Alcea Band of Tillamooks,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/40/case.html">329 U. S. 40</a></span> (1946), where this Court affirmed a judgment of the Court of Claims that certain named Indian tribes "are entitled to recover" compensation for the taking of original Indian title by the United States in 1855.  The amount of recovery was reserved expressly for the further proceedings which are before the Court in this case.  After the affirmance, the Court of Claims heard evidence on the amount of recovery and entered a judgment for the value of the lands as of 1855 plus interest from that  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 341 U. S. 49</a></p><p> date.  87 F.Supp. 938, 115 Ct.Cl. 463.  We granted certiorari limited to the question presented by the award of interest. 340 U.S. 873 (1950).</p>\n<p>It is the "traditional rule" that interest on claims against the United States cannot be recovered in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in the relevant statute or contract.  28 U.S.C. (Supp. III), \xc2\xa7 2516(a).  <em>United States v. Thayer-West Point Hotel Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/585/case.html">329 U. S. 585</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/585/case.html#588">329 U. S. 588</a></span> (1947), and cases cited therein.  This rule precludes an award of interest even though a statute should direct an award of "just compensation" for a particular taking.  <em>United States v. Goltra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/203/case.html">312 U. S. 203</a></span> (1941).  The only exception arises when the taking entitles the claimant to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.  Only in such cases does the award of compensation include interest.  <em>Seaboard Airline R. Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/299/case.html">261 U. S. 299</a></span> (1923); <em>United States v. Thayer-West Point Hotel Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p>Looking to the former opinions in this case, we find that none of them expressed the view that recovery was grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment.  And, since the applicable jurisdictional Act, 49 Stat. 801 (1935), contains no provision authorizing an award of interest, such award must be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
