The trial court denied the suppression motion in part, and McCurry was subsequently convicted after a jury trial.  The conviction was later affirmed on appeal.  <em>State v. McCurry,</em> 587 S.W.2d 337 (Mo.App. 1979).  Because he did not assert that the state courts had denied him a "full and fair opportunity" to litigate his seizure claim, McCurry was barred by this Court\'s decision in <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span>, from seeking a writ of habeas corpus in a federal district court.  Nevertheless, he sought federal court redress for the alleged constitutional violation by bringing a damages suit under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 against the officers who had entered his home and seized the evidence in question.  We granted certiorari to consider whether the unavailability of federal habeas corpus prevented the police officers from raising the state courts\' partial rejection of McCurry\'s constitutional claim as a collateral estoppel defense to the \xc2\xa7 1983 suit against them for damages.  444 U.S. 1070. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 449 U. S. 92</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In April, 1977, several undercover police officers, following an informant\'s tip that McCurry was dealing in heroin, went to his house in St. Louis, Mo., to attempt a purchase. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Two officers, petitioners Allen and Jacobsmeyer, knocked on the front door, while the other officers hid nearby.  When McCurry opened the door, the two officers asked to buy some heroin "caps."  McCurry went back into the house and returned soon thereafter, firing a pistol at and seriously wounding Allen and Jacobsmeyer.  After a gun battle with the other officers and their reinforcements, McCurry retreated into the house; he emerged again when the police demanded that he surrender.  Several officers then entered the house without a warrant, purportedly to search for other persons inside.  One of the officers seized drugs and other contraband that lay in plain view, as well as additional contraband he found in dresser drawers and in auto tires on the porch.</p>\n<p>McCurry was charged with possession of heroin and assault with intent to kill.  At the pretrial suppression hearing, the trial judge excluded the evidence seized from the dresser drawers and tires, but denied suppression of the evidence found in plain view.  McCurry was convicted of both the heroin and assault offenses.</p>\n<p>McCurry subsequently filed the present \xc2\xa7 1983 action for $ 1 million in damages against petitioners Allen and Jacobsmeyer, other unnamed individual police officers, and the city of St. Louis and its police department.  The complaint alleged a conspiracy to violate McCurry\'s Fourth Amendment rights, an unconstitutional seizure of his house, and an assault on him by unknown police officers after he had been arrested and handcuffed.  The petitioners moved for summary judgment.  The District Court apparently understood </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 449 U. S. 93</a></p><p> the gist of the complaint to be the allegedly unconstitutional seizure, and granted summary judgment, holding that collateral estoppel prevented McCurry from relitigating the search and seizure question already decided against him in the state courts.  466 F.Supp. 514 (ED Mo.1978). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case for trial.  606 F.2d 795 (CA8 1979). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The appellate court said it was not holding that collateral estoppel was generally inapplicable in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit raising issues determined against the federal plaintiff in a state criminal trial.  <em>Id.</em> at 798.  But noting that <em>Stone v. Powell, supra,</em> barred McCurry from federal habeas corpus relief, and invoking "the special role of the federal courts in protecting civil rights," 606 F.2d at 799, the court concluded that the \xc2\xa7 1983 suit was McCurry\'s only route to a federal forum for his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 449 U. S. 94</a></p><p> constitutional claim and directed the trial court to allow him to proceed to trial unencumbered by collateral estoppel. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The federal courts have traditionally adhered to the related doctrines of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel.  Under <em>res judicata,</em> a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.  <em>Cromwell v. County of Sac,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/351/case.html">94 U. S. 351</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/351/case.html#352">94 U. S. 352</a></span>.  Under collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.  <em>Montana v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html">440 U. S. 147</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html#153">440 U. S. 153</a></span>. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As this Court and other courts have often recognized, <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html#153">440 U. S. 153</a></span>-154.</p>\n<p>In recent years, this Court has reaffirmed the benefits of collateral estoppel in particular, finding the policies underlying it to apply in contexts not formerly recognized at common law.  Thus, the Court has eliminated the requirement of mutuality in applying collateral estoppel to bar relitigation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 449 U. S. 95</a></p><p> of issues decided earlier in federal court suits, <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/313/case.html">402 U. S. 313</a></span>, and has allowed a litigant who was not a party to a federal case to use collateral estoppel "offensively" in a new federal suit against the party who lost on the decided issue in the first case, <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/319/case.html#322">43 U. S. 322</a></span>. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But one general limitation the Court has repeatedly recognized is that the concept of collateral estoppel cannot apply when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a "full and fair opportunity" to litigate that issue in the earlier case.  <em>Montana v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html#153">440 U. S. 153</a></span>; <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/313/case.html#328">402 U. S. 328</a></span>-329. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The federal courts generally have also consistently accorded preclusive effect to issues decided by state courts.  <em>E.g., Montana v. United States, supra; Angel v. Bullington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/183/case.html">330 U. S. 183</a></span>.  Thus, <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel not only reduce unnecessary litigation and foster reliance on adjudication, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 449 U. S. 96</a></p><p> but also promote the comity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark of the federal system.  <em>See Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#43">401 U. S. 43</a></span>-45.</p>\n<p>Indeed, though the federal courts may look to the common law or to the policies supporting <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel in assessing the preclusive effect of decisions of other federal courts, Congress has specifically required all federal courts to give preclusive effect to state court judgments whenever the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged would do so:</p>\n<p>"[J]udicial proceedings [of any court of any State] shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State. . . ."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Huron Holding Corp. v. Lincoln Mine Operating Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/183/case.html">312 U. S. 183</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/183/case.html#193">312 U. S. 193</a></span>;  <em>Davis v.

S. 40</a></span>.  It is against this background that we examine the relationship of \xc2\xa7 1983 and collateral estoppel, and the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court has never directly decided whether the rules of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel are generally applicable to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  But in <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/475/case.html">411 U. S. 475</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/475/case.html#497">411 U. S. 497</a></span>, the Court noted with implicit approval the view of other federal courts that <em>res judicata</em> principles fully apply to civil rights suits brought under that statute.  <em>See also Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html">420 U. S. 592</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#606">420 U. S. 606</a></span>, n. 18; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html">Wolff v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 449 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  And the virtually unanimous view of the Courts of Appeals since <em>Preiser</em> has been that \xc2\xa7 1983 presents no categorical bar to the application of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel concepts. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  These federal appellate court decisions have spoken with little explanation or citation in assuming the compatibility of \xc2\xa7 1983 and rules of preclusion, but the statute and its legislative history clearly support the courts\' decisions.</p>\n<p>Because the requirement of mutuality of estoppel was still alive in the federal courts until well into this century, <em>see Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/313/case.html#322">402 U. S. 322</a></span>-323, the drafters of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, of which \xc2\xa7 1983 is a part, may have had less reason to concern themselves with rules of preclusion than a modern Congress would.  Nevertheless, in 1871 <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel could certainly have applied in federal suits following state court litigation between the same parties or their privies, and nothing in the language of \xc2\xa7 1983 remotely expresses any congressional intent to contravene the common law rules of preclusion or to repeal the express statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 449 U. S. 98</a></p><p> requirements of the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738, <em>see</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em>  Section 1983 creates a new federal cause of action. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It says nothing about the preclusive effect of state court judgments. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 does not in any clear way suggest that Congress intended to repeal or restrict the traditional doctrines of preclusion.  The main goal of the Act was to override the corrupting influence of the Ku Klux Klan and its sympathizers on the governments and law enforcement agencies of the Southern States, <em>see Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#174">365 U. S. 174</a></span>, and of course the debates show that one strong motive behind its enactment was grave congressional concern that the state courts had been deficient in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 449 U. S. 99</a></p><p> protecting federal rights, <em>Mitchum v. Foster,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html">407 U. S. 225</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#241">407 U. S. 241</a></span>-242; <em>Monroe v. Pape, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#180">365 U. S. 180</a></span>. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But in the context of the legislative history as a whole, this congressional concern lends only the most equivocal support to any argument that, in cases where the state courts have recognized the constitutional claims asserted and provided fair procedures for determining them, Congress intended to override \xc2\xa7 1738 or the common law rules of collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata.</em>  Since repeals by implication are disfavored, <em>Radzanower v. Touche Ross &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/148/case.html">426 U. S. 148</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/148/case.html#154">426 U. S. 154</a></span>, much clearer support than this would be required to hold that \xc2\xa7 1738 and the traditional rules of preclusion are not applicable to \xc2\xa7 1983 suits.</p>\n<p>As the Court has understood the history of the legislation, Congress realized that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983, it was altering the balance of judicial power between the state and federal courts.  <em>See Mitchum v. Foster, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#241">407 U. S. 241</a></span>.  But in doing so, Congress was adding to the jurisdiction of the federal courts, not subtracting from that of the state courts.  <em>See Monroe v. Pape, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#183">365 U. S. 183</a></span> ("The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy." . . .). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The debates contain several references to the concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts over federal questions, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and numerous suggestions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 449 U. S. 100</a></p><p> that the state courts would retain their established jurisdiction so that they could, when the then current political passions abated, demonstrate a new sensitivity to federal rights. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>To the extent that it did intend to change the balance of power over federal questions between the state and federal courts, the 42d Congress was acting in a way thoroughly consistent with the doctrines of preclusion.  In reviewing the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 in <em>Monroe v. Pape, supra,</em> the Court inferred that Congress had intended a federal remedy in three circumstances:  where state substantive law was facially unconstitutional, where state procedural law was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 449 U. S. 101</a></p><p> inadequate to allow full litigation of a constitutional claim, and where state procedural law, though adequate in theory, was inadequate in practice.  365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#173">365 U. S. 173</a></span>-174.  In short, the federal courts could step in where the state courts were unable or unwilling to protect federal rights.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#176">365 U. S. 176</a></span>.  This understanding of \xc2\xa7 1983 might well support an exception to <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel where state law did not provide fair procedures for the litigation of constitutional claims, or where a state court failed to even acknowledge the existence of the constitutional principle on which a litigant based his claim.  Such an exception, however, would be essentially the same as the important general limit on rules of preclusion that already exists:  collateral estoppel does not apply where the party against whom an earlier court decision is asserted did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim or issue decided by the first court.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#95">449 U. S. 95</a></span>.  But the Court\'s view of \xc2\xa7 1983 in <em>Monroe</em> lends no strength to any argument that Congress intended to allow relitigation of federal issues decided after a full and fair hearing in a state court simply because the state court\'s decision may have been erroneous. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 449 U. S. 102</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged that every Court of Appeals that has squarely decided the question has held that collateral estoppel applies when \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs attempt to relitigate in federal court issues decided against them in state criminal proceedings. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  But the court noted that the only two federal appellate decisions invoking collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of Fourth Amendment claims decided adversely to the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs in state court came before this Court\'s decision in <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span>. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  It also noted that some of the decisions holding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 449 U. S. 103</a></p><p> collateral estoppel applicable to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions were based at least in part on the estopped party\'s access to another federal forum through habeas corpus. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The Court of Appeals thus concluded that, since <em>Stone v. Powell</em> had removed McCurry\'s right to a hearing of his Fourth Amendment claim in federal habeas corpus, collateral estoppel should not deprive him of a federal judicial hearing of that claim in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit.</p>\n<p><em>Stone v. Powell</em> does not provide a logical doctrinal source for the court\'s ruling.  This Court in <em>Stone</em> assessed the costs and benefits of the judge-made exclusionary rule within the boundaries of the federal courts\' statutory power to issue writs of habeas corpus, and decided that the incremental deterrent effect that the issuance of the writ in Fourth Amendment cases might have on police conduct did not justify the cost the writ imposed upon the fair administration of criminal justice.  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#489">428 U.

It has no bearing on \xc2\xa7 1983 suits or on the question of the preclusive effect of state court judgments.</p>\n<p>The actual basis of the Court of Appeals\' holding appears to be a generally framed principle that every person asserting a federal right is entitled to one unencumbered opportunity to litigate that right in a federal district court, regardless of the legal posture in which the federal claim arises.  But the authority for this principle is difficult to discern.  It cannot lie in the Constitution, which makes no such guarantee, but leaves the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal district courts to the wisdom of Congress. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  And no such authority is to be found in \xc2\xa7 1983 itself.  For reasons already discussed at length, nothing in the language or legislative history of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 449 U. S. 104</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 1983 proves any congressional intent to deny binding effect to a state court judgment or decision when the state court, acting within its proper jurisdiction, has given the parties a full and fair opportunity to litigate federal claims, and thereby has shown itself willing and able to protect federal rights.  And nothing in the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 reveals any purpose to afford less deference to judgments in state criminal proceedings than to those in state civil proceedings. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  There is, in short, no reason to believe that Congress intended to provide a person claiming a federal right an unrestricted opportunity to relitigate an issue already decided in state court simply because the issue arose in a state proceeding in which he would rather not have been engaged at all. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Through \xc2\xa7 1983, the 42d Congress intended to afford an opportunity for legal and equitable relief in a federal court for certain types of injuries.  It is difficult to believe that the drafters of that Act considered it a substitute for a federal writ of habeas corpus, the purpose of which is not to redress civil injury, but to release the applicant from unlawful physical confinement, <em>Preiser v.

It is ironic that <em>Stone v.

The state courts upheld the entry of the house as a reasonable response to emergency circumstances, but held illegal the seizure of any evidence discovered as a result of that entry except what was in plain view.  <em>Id.</em> at 340.  McCurry therefore argues here that, even if the doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies to this case, he should be able to proceed to trial to obtain damages for the part of the seizure declared illegal by the state courts.  The petitioners contend, on the other hand, that the complaint alleged essentially an illegal entry, adding that only the entry could possibly justify the $ 1 million prayer.  Since the state courts upheld the entry, the petitioners argue that, if collateral estoppel applies here at all, it removes from trial all issues except the alleged assault.  The United States Court of Appeals, however, addressed only the broad question of the applicability of collateral estoppel to \xc2\xa7 1983 suits brought by plaintiffs in McCurry\'s circumstances, and questions as to the scope of collateral estoppel with respect to the particular issues in this case are not now before us.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Beyond holding that collateral estoppel does not apply in this case, the Court of Appeals noted that the District Court had overlooked the conspiracy and assault charges.  606 F.2d at 797, and n. 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, relying on the doctrine of <em>Younger v.

Our decision does not "fashion" any doctrine of collateral estoppel at all.  Rather, it construes \xc2\xa7 1983 to determine whether the conventional doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to the case at hand.

In the <em>England</em> case, a party first submitted to a federal court his claim that a state statute violated his constitutional rights.  The federal court abstained and remitted the plaintiff to the state courts, holding that a state court decision that the statute did not apply to the plaintiff would moot the federal question.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html#413">375 U.

This Court held that, in such a circumstance, a plaintiff who properly reserved the federal issue by informing the state courts of his intention to return to federal court, if necessary, was not precluded from litigating the federal question in federal court.  The holding in <em>England</em> depended entirely on this Court\'s view of the purpose of abstention in such a case:  where a plaintiff properly invokes federal court jurisdiction in the first instance on a federal claim, the federal court has a duty to accept that jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html#415">375 U.

I do not doubt that principles of preclusion are to be given such effect as is appropriate in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action.  In many cases, the denial of <em>res judicata</em> or collateral estoppel effect would serve no purpose and would harm relations between federal and state tribunals.  Nonetheless, the Court\'s analysis in this particular case is unacceptable to me.  It works injustice on this \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff, and it makes more difficult the consistent protection of constitutional rights, a consideration that was at the core of the enacters\' intent.  Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p>In deciding whether a common law doctrine is to apply to \xc2\xa7 1983 when the statute itself is silent, prior cases uniformly have accorded the intent of the legislators great weight. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  For example, in reference to the judicially created immunity doctrine, the Court has observed that, when the</p>\n<p>"immunity claimed . . . was well established at common law at the time \xc2\xa7 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have construed the statute to incorporate that immunity."</p>\n<p><em>Owen v. City of Independence,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/622/case.html">445 U.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  This very proper inquiry must be made in order to ensure that \xc2\xa7 1983 will continue to serve the important goals intended for it by the 42d Congress.  In the present case, however, the Court minimizes the significance of the legislative history and discounts its own prior explicit interpretations of the statute.  Its discussion is limited to articulating what it terms the single fundamental principle of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 449 U. S. 107</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondent\'s position merits a quite different analysis.  Although the legislators of the 42d Congress did not expressly state whether the then existing common law doctrine of preclusion would survive enactment of \xc2\xa7 1983, they plainly anticipated more than the creation of a federal statutory remedy to be administered indifferently by either a state or a federal court. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The legislative intent, as expressed by supporters [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] and understood by opponents, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] was to restructure relations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 449 U. S. 108</a></p><p> between the state and federal courts. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Congress deliberately opened the federal courts to individual citizens in response to the States\' failure to provide justice in their own courts.  Contrary to the view presently expressed by the Court, the 42d Congress was not concerned solely with procedural regularity.  Even where there was procedural regularity, which the Court today so stresses, Congress believed that substantive justice was unobtainable. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The availability of the federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 449 U. S. 109</a></p><p> forum was not meant to turn on whether, in an individual case, the state procedures were adequate.  Assessing the state of affairs as a whole, Congress specifically made a determination that federal oversight of constitutional determinations through the federal courts was necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>That the new federal jurisdiction was conceived of as concurrent with state jurisdiction does not alter the significance of Congress\' opening the federal courts to these claims.  Congress consciously acted in the broadest possible manner. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  The legislators perceived that justice was not being done in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 449 U. S. 110</a></p><p> the States then dominated by the Klan, and it seems senseless to suppose that they would have intended the federal courts to give full preclusive effect to prior state adjudications.  That supposition would contradict their obvious aim to right the wrongs perpetuated in those same courts.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that the legislative history is capable of alternative interpretations.  <em>See</em> the Court\'s opinion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#98">449 U. S. 98</a></span>-101.  I would have thought, however, that our prior decisions made very clear which reading is required.  The Court repeatedly has recognized that \xc2\xa7 1983 embodies a strong congressional policy in favor of federal courts\' acting as the primary and final arbiters of constitutional rights. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  In <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961), the Court held that Congress passed the legislation in order to substitute a federal forum for the ineffective, although plainly available, state remedies:</p>\n<p>"It is abundantly clear that one reason the legislation was passed was to afford a federal right in federal courts because, by reason of prejudice, passion, neglect, intolerance or otherwise, state laws might not be enforced and the claims of citizens to the enjoyment of rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment might be denied by the state agencies."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#180">365 U.

S. 173</a></span>.  Yet, in that case, the Court\'s recounting of the legislative history and its articulation of these three purposes were intended only as illustrative of why the 42d Congress chose to establish a federal remedy in federal court, not as a delineation of when the remedy would be available.  The Court\'s conclusion was that this remedy was to be available no matter what the circumstances of state law:</p>\n<p>"It is no answer that the State has a law which, if enforced, would give relief.  The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.  Hence, the fact that Illinois, by its constitution and laws, outlaws unreasonable searches and seizures is no barrier to the present suit in the federal court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#183">365 U.

Medical Examiners,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html">375 U. S. 411</a></span> (1964), the Court had affirmed the federal courts\' special role in protecting constitutional rights under \xc2\xa7 1983.  In that case, it held that a plaintiff required by the abstention doctrine to submit his constitutional claim first to a state court could not be precluded entirely from having the federal court, in which he initially had sought relief, pass on his constitutional claim.  The Court relied on</p>\n<p>"the unqualified terms in which Congress, pursuant to constitutional authorization, has conferred specific categories of jurisdiction upon the federal courts,"</p>\n<p>and on its</p>\n<p>"fundamental objections to any conclusion that a litigant who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court to consider federal constitutional claims can be compelled, without his consent and through no fault of his own, to accept instead a state court\'s determination of those claims."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html#415">375 U. S. 415</a></span>.  The Court set out its understanding as to when a litigant in a \xc2\xa7 1983 case might be precluded by prior litigation, holding that,</p>\n<p>"if a party, freely and without reservation, submits his federal claims for decision by the state courts, litigates them there, and has them decided there, then -- whether or not he seeks direct review of the state decision in this Court -- he has elected to forgo his right to return to the District Court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html#419">375 U. S. 419</a></span>.  I do not understand why the Court today should abandon this approach.</p>\n<p>The Court now fashions a new doctrine of preclusion, applicable only to actions brought under \xc2\xa7 1983, that is more </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 449 U. S. 113</a></p><p> strict and more confining than the federal rules of preclusion applied in other cases.  In <em>Montana v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html">440 U. S. 147</a></span> (1979), the Court pronounced three major factors to be considered in determining whether collateral estoppel serves as a barrier in the federal court:</p>\n<p>"[W]hether the issues presented . . . are in substance the same . . . ; whether controlling facts or legal principles have changed significantly since the state court judgment; and finally, whether other special circumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/case.html#155">440 U. S. 155</a></span>.</p>\n<p>But now the Court states that the collateral estoppel effect of prior state adjudication should turn on only one factor, namely, what it considers the "one general limitation" inherent in the doctrine of preclusion:</p>\n<p>"that the concept of collateral estoppel cannot apply when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a \'full and fair opportunity\' to litigate that issue in the earlier case."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#95">449 U. S. 95</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#101">449 U. S. 101</a></span>.  If that one factor is present, the Court asserts, the litigant properly should be barred from relitigating the issue in federal court. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  One cannot deny that this factor is an important one.  I do not believe, however, that the doctrine of preclusion requires the inquiry to be so narrow, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] and my understanding of the policies underlying \xc2\xa7 1983 would lead me to consider all relevant factors in each case before concluding that preclusion was warranted.</p>\n<p>In this case, the police officers seek to prevent a criminal defendant from relitigating the constitutionality of their conduct in searching his house, after the state trial court had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 449 U. S. 114</a></p><p> found that conduct in part violative of the defendant\'s Fourth Amendment rights and in part justified by the circumstances.  I doubt that the police officers, now defendants in this \xc2\xa7 1983 action, can be considered to have been in privity with the State in its role as prosecutor.  Therefore, only "issue preclusion" [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] is at stake.</p>\n<p>The following factors persuade me to conclude that this respondent should not be precluded from asserting his claim in federal court.  First, at the time \xc2\xa7 1983 was passed, a nonparty\'s ability, as a practical matter, to invoke collateral estoppel was nonexistent.  One could not preclude an opponent from relitigating an issue in a new cause of action, though that issue had been determined conclusively in a prior proceeding, unless there was "mutuality." [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Additionally, the definitions of "cause of action" and "issue" were narrow. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  As a result, and obviously, no preclusive effect could arise out of a criminal proceeding that would affect subsequent civil litigation.  Thus, the 42d Congress could not have anticipated or approved that a criminal defendant, tried and convicted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 449 U. S. 115</a></p><p> in state court, would be precluded from raising against police officers a constitutional claim arising out of his arrest.</p>\n<p>Also, the process of deciding in a state criminal trial whether to exclude or admit evidence is not at all the equivalent of a \xc2\xa7 1983 proceeding.  The remedy sought in the latter is utterly different.  In bringing the civil suit, the criminal defendant does not seek to challenge his conviction collaterally.  At most, he wins damages.  In contrast, the exclusion of evidence may prevent a criminal conviction.  A trial court, faced with the decision whether to exclude relevant evidence, confronts institutional pressures that may cause it to give a different shape to the Fourth Amendment right from what would result in civil litigation of a damages claim.  Also, the issue whether to exclude evidence is subsidiary to the purpose of a criminal trial, which is to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and a trial court, at least subconsciously, must weigh the potential damage to the truthseeking process caused by excluding relevant evidence.  <em>See Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#489">428 U. S. 489</a></span>-495 (1976).  <em>Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#411">403 U. S. 411</a></span>-412 (1971) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>A state criminal defendant cannot be held to have chosen "voluntarily" to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim in the state court.  The risk of conviction puts pressure upon him to raise all possible defenses. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  He also faces uncertainty about the wisdom of forgoing litigation on any issue, for there is the possibility that he will be held to have waived his right to appeal on that issue.  The "deliberate bypass" of state procedures, which the imposition of collateral estoppel under these circumstances encourages, surely is not a preferred goal.  To hold that a criminal defendant who raises a Fourth Amendment claim at his criminal trial "freely and without reservation submits his federal claims for decision by the state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 449 U. S. 116</a></p><p> courts," <em>see England v. Medical Examiners,</em> 375 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/case.html#419">375 U. S. 419</a></span>, is to deny reality.  The criminal defendant is an involuntary litigant in the state tribunal, and against him all the forces of the State are arrayed.  To force him to a choice between forgoing either a potential defense or a federal forum for hearing his constitutional civil claim is fundamentally unfair.
