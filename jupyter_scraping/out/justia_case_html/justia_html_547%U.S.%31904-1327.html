SOUTH CAROLINA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">HOLMES <em>v</em>. SOUTH CAROLINA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x931327.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 22, 2006\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 1, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">At petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s South Carolina trial for murder and related crimes, the prosecution relied heavily on forensic evidence that strongly supported petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  Petitioner sought to undermine the State\xe2\x80\x99s forensic evidence by introducing expert testimony suggesting that the evidence had been contaminated and that the police had engaged in a plot to frame him.  Petitioner also sought to introduce evidence that another man, Jimmy McCaw White, had been in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood on the morning of the assault and that White had either acknowledged petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s innocence or admitted to committing the crimes himself.  In White\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial testimony, he denied making the incriminating statements and provided an alibi for the time of the assault.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court excluded petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s third-party guilt evidence citing the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Gregory</em> decision, which held such evidence admissible if it raises a reasonable inference as to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own innocence, but inadmissible if it merely casts a bare suspicion or raises a conjectural inference as to another\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  Affirming the trial court, the State Supreme Court cited both <em>Gregory </em>and its later decision in <em>Gay</em>, and held that where there is strong forensic evidence of an appellant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, proffered evidence about a third party\xe2\x80\x99s alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s own innocence.  Applying this standard, the court held that petitioner could not overcome the forensic evidence against him.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional rights are violated by an evidence rule under which the defendant may not introduce evidence of third-party guilt if the prosecution has introduced forensic evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a guilty verdict.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Scheffer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/303/index.html">523 U. S. 303</a>, 308.  This latitude, however, has limits.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants \xe2\x80\x98a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crane</em> v. <em>Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/683/index.html">476 U. S. 683</a>, 690.  This right is abridged by evidence rules that \xe2\x80\x9cinfring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arbitrary\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scheffer,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 308.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury<em>.  </em>An application of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with which they are charged.  Such rules are widely accepted and are not challenged here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Gregory,</em> the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted and applied a rule intended to be of this type.  In <em>Gay</em> and this case, however, that court radically changed and extended the <em>Gregory </em>rule by holding that, where there is strong evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, especially strong forensic evidence, proffered evidence about a third party\xe2\x80\x99s alleged guilt may (or perhaps must) be excluded.  Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-party guilt.  Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case: If the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case is strong enough, the evidence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.  Furthermore, as applied below, the rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses or the reliability of its evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By evaluating the strength of only one party\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt.  Because the rule applied below did not heed this point, the rule is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the <em>Gregory</em> rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to further.  Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end served by the rule.  Thus, the rule violates a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crane, supra</em>, at 690.

She later died of complications stemming from her injuries.  Petitioner was convicted by a South Carolina jury of murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree burglary, and robbery, and he was sentenced to death.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Holmes</em>, 320 S.\xc2\xa0C. 259, 262, 464 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 334, 336 (1995).

At a pretrial hearing, petitioner proffered several witnesses who placed White in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood on the morning of the assault, as well as four other witnesses who testified that White had either acknowledged that petitioner was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98innocent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or had actually admitted to committing the crimes.  <em>Id.,</em> at 340\xe2\x80\x93342, 605 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.

Another witness, who had been incarcerated with White, testified that White had admitted to assaulting Stewart, that a police officer had asked the witness to testify falsely against petitioner, and that employees of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s office, while soliciting the witness\xe2\x80\x99 cooperation, had spoken of manufacturing evidence against petitioner.  <em>Id.,</em> at 38\xe2\x80\x9350.

In <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/14/index.html">388 U. S. 14</a> (1967), state statutes barred a person who had been charged as a participant in a crime from testifying in defense of another alleged participant unless the witness had been acquitted.  As a result, when the defendant in <em>Washington</em> was tried for murder, he was precluded from calling as a witness a person who had been charged and previously convicted of committing the same murder.  Holding that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to put on a defense had been violated, we noted that the rule embodied in the statutes could not \xe2\x80\x9ceven be defended on the ground that it rationally sets apart a group of persons who are particularly likely to commit perjury\xe2\x80\x9d since the rule allowed an alleged participant to testify if he or she had been acquitted or was called by the prosecution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A similar constitutional violation occurred in <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>Mississippi, supra</em>.  A murder defendant called as a witness a man named McDonald, who had previously confessed to the murder.  When McDonald repudiated the confession on the stand, the defendant was denied permission to examine McDonald as an adverse witness based on the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98voucher\xe2\x80\x99 rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which barred parties from impeaching their own witnesses.  <em>Id.</em>, at 294.  In addition, because the state hearsay rule did not include an exception for statements against penal interest, the defendant was not permitted to introduce evidence that McDonald had made self-incriminating statements to three other persons.  Noting that the State had not even attempted to \xe2\x80\x9cdefend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexplain [the] underlying rationale\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cvoucher rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 297, this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusion of [the evidence of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements], coupled with the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to permit [the defendant] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 302.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in <em>Crane</em> v. <em>Kentucky, supra</em>.  There, the defendant was prevented from attempting to show at trial that his confession was unreliable because of the circumstances under which it was obtained, and neither the State Supreme Court nor the prosecution \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced any rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpatory evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 691.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Rock</em> v. <em>Arkansas,</em> <em>supra</em>, this Court held that a rule prohibiting hypnotically refreshed testimony was unconstitutional because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]holesale inadmissibility of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is an arbitrary restriction on the right to testify in the absence of clear evidence by the State repudiating the validity of all post-hypnotic recollections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 61.  By contrast, in<em> United States</em> v. <em>Scheffer,</em> <em>supra</em>, we held that a rule excluding all polygraph evidence did not abridge the right to present a defense because the rule \xe2\x80\x9cserve[d] several legitimate interests in the criminal trial process,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cneither arbitrary nor disproportionate in promoting these ends,\xe2\x80\x9d and did not \xe2\x80\x9cimplicate a sufficiently weighty interest of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 309.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Fed. Rule Evid. 403; Uniform Rule of Evid. 45 (1953); ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 303 (1942); 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71863, 1904 (1904).  Plainly referring to rules of this type, we have stated that the Constitution permits judges \xe2\x80\x9cto exclude evidence that is \xe2\x80\x98repetitive \xe2\x80\xa6 , only marginally relevant\xe2\x80\x99 or poses an undue risk of \xe2\x80\x98harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crane</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 689\xe2\x80\x93690 (quoting <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Van Arsdall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/index.html">475 U.

[B]efore such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  198 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 104\xe2\x80\x93105, 16 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (quoting 16 C.\xc2\xa0J., Criminal Law \xc2\xa71085, p. 560 (1918) and 20 Am. Jur., Evidence \xc2\xa7265, p. 254 (1939); footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Gay</em> and this case, however, the South Carolina Supreme Court radically changed and extended the rule.  In <em>Gay</em>, after recognizing the standard applied in <em>Gregory</em>, the court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of the strong evidence of appellant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt\xe2\x80\x94especially the forensic evidence\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 the proffered evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 did not raise \xe2\x80\x98a reasonable inference\xe2\x80\x99 as to appellant\xe2\x80\x99s own innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gay</em>, 343 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 550, 541 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 545 (quoting <em>Gregory</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 104, 16 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 534, in turn quoting 16 C.\xc2\xa0J., \xc2\xa71085, at 560).  Similarly, in the present case, as noted, the State Supreme Court applied the rule that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere there is strong evidence of [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party\xe2\x80\x99s alleged guilt\xe2\x80\x9d may (or perhaps must) be excluded.  361 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 342, 605 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-party guilt.  Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case: If the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case is strong enough, the evidence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, as applied in this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses or the reliability of its evidence.  Here, for example, the defense strenuously claimed that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s forensic evidence was so unreliable (due to mishandling and a deliberate plot to frame petitioner) that the evidence should not have even been admitted.  The South Carolina Supreme Court responded that these challenges did not entirely \xe2\x80\x9ceviscerate\xe2\x80\x9d the forensic evidence and that the defense challenges went to the weight and not to the admissibility of that evidence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 343, n.\xc2\xa08, 605 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 24, n.\xc2\xa08.  Yet, in evaluating the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s forensic evidence and deeming it to be \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thereby justifying exclusion of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s third-party guilt evidence\xe2\x80\x94the South Carolina Supreme Court made no mention of the defense challenges to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreted in this way, the rule applied by the State Supreme Court does not rationally serve the end that the <em>Gregory</em> rule and its analogues in other jurisdictions were designed to promote, <em>i.e.</em>, to focus the trial on the central issues by excluding evidence that has only a very weak logical connection to the central issues.  The rule applied in this case appears to be based on the following logic: Where (1) it is clear that only one person was involved in the commission of a particular crime and (2) there is strong evidence that the defendant was the perpetrator, it follows that evidence of third-party guilt must be weak.  But this logic depends on an accurate evaluation of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proof, and the true strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proof cannot be assessed without considering challenges to the reliability of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  Just because the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, <em>if credited</em>, would provide strong support for a guilty verdict, it does not follow that evidence of third-party guilt has only a weak logical connection to the central issues in the case.  And where the credibility of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses or the reliability of its evidence is not conceded, the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case cannot be assessed without making the sort of factual findings that have traditionally been reserved for the trier of fact and that the South Carolina courts did not purport to make in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule applied in this case is no more logical than its converse would be, <em>i.e.</em>, a rule barring the prosecution from introducing evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt if the defendant is able to proffer, at a pretrial hearing, evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a verdict of not guilty.  In the present case, for example, the petitioner proffered evidence that, if believed, squarely proved that White, not petitioner, was the perpetrator.  It would make no sense, however, to hold that this proffer precluded the prosecution from introducing its evidence, including the forensic evidence that, if credited, provided strong proof of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point is that, by evaluating the strength of only one party\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt.  Because the rule applied by the State Supreme Court in this case did not heed this point, the rule is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the <em>Gregory</em> rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to further.  Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end that the rule serves.  It follows that the rule applied in this case by the State Supreme Court violates a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crane</em>, 476 U.
