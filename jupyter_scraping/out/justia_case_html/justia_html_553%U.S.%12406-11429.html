Burgess had a prior South Carolina cocaine possession conviction, which carried a maximum sentence of two years but was classified as a misdemeanor under state law.  The Federal Government argued that Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 minimum federal sentence should be enhanced to 20 years under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) because his South Carolina conviction was punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment.  Burgess countered that because \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates the term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d a word separately defined in \xc2\xa7802(13), a prior drug offense does not warrant an enhanced \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) sentence unless it is both (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction, per \xc2\xa7802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment, per \xc2\xa7802(44).  Rejecting that argument, the District Court ruled that \xc2\xa7802(44) alone controls the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.   </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) is defined exclusively by \xc2\xa7802(44) and does not incorporate \xc2\xa7802(13)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d a state drug offense punishable by more than one year qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense,\xe2\x80\x9d even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The CSA\xe2\x80\x99s language and structure indicate that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as a term of art defined by \xc2\xa7802(44) without reference to \xc2\xa7802(13).  First, a definition such as \xc2\xa7802(44)\xe2\x80\x99s that declares what a term \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d generally excludes any meaning that is not stated.  <em>E.g., Colautti</em> v. <em>Franklin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/index.html">439 U. S. 379</a>, 392\xe2\x80\x93393, n.\xc2\xa010.   Second, because \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a), \xc2\xa7802(44)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\xe2\x80\x9d leaves no blank for \xc2\xa7802(13) to fill.  Third, if Congress wanted \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d to incorporate \xc2\xa7802(13)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d it easily could have written \xc2\xa7802(44) to state: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98felony drug offense\xe2\x80\x99 means a <em>felony</em> that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fourth, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading avoids anomalies that would arise if both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7802(13) and 802(44) governed application of \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement.  Section 802(13) includes only federal and state offenses and would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  Furthermore, Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 compound definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in state and foreign jurisdictions that do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors.  Finally, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7802(44) hardly renders \xc2\xa7802(13) extraneous; the latter section serves to define \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d for the many CSA provisions using that unadorned term.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The CSA\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history reinforces the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  In 1988, Congress first defined \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9can offense that is a <em>felony</em> under \xe2\x80\xa6 any law of a State\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), but, in 1994, it amended the statutory definition to its present form.  By recognizing \xc2\xa7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to eliminate disparities resulting from divergent state classifications of offenses by adopting a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment.  By contrast, Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition already requiring designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction would attribute to the amendment little practical effect and encounters formidable impediments: the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and history.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the rule of lenity should be applied in determining whether \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates \xc2\xa7802(13)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d is rejected.  The touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.  <em>E.g., Bifulco</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/381/index.html">447 U. S. 381</a>, 387.  Because Congress expressly defined \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner that is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive, there is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve here.

That minimum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The question in this case is whether a state drug offense classified as a misdemeanor, but punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment, is a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two statutory definitions figure in our decision.  Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d to mean any \xe2\x80\x9coffense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 802(44) defines the compound term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d to mean an offense involving specified drugs that is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d contained in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s provision for a 20-year minimum sentence, we hold, is defined exclusively by \xc2\xa7802(44) and does not incorporate \xc2\xa7802(13)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d  A state drug offense punishable by more than one year therefore qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense,\xe2\x80\x9d even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Keith Lavon Burgess pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.

Although that offense carried a maximum sentence of two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, South Carolina classified it as a misdemeanor.  \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x9353\xe2\x80\x93370(d)(1).  Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 prior South Carolina conviction, the Government urged, raised the minimum sentence for his federal conviction to 20 years.  The enhancement was mandatory, the Government maintained, because Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d to include state cocaine offenses \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U.

Although the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling subjected Burgess to a 20-year minimum sentence, the Government moved for a downward departure based on Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 substantial assistance in another prosecution.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(e) (2000 ed., Supp. V).

Under his reading, the \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) enhancement is triggered only when the prior conviction is both \xe2\x80\x9cclassified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7802(13), and \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7802(44).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, in contrast, reads \xc2\xa7802(44) to provide the exclusive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, all defendants whose prior drug crimes were punishable by more than one year in prison would be subject to the \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) enhancement, regardless of the punishing jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s classification of the offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, we are convinced, correctly interprets the statutory text and context.

Congress has often used that drafting technique\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, repeating a discretely defined word\xe2\x80\x94when it intends to incorporate the definition of a particular word into the definition of a compound expression.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(13) and \xc2\xa7802(44) governed application of the sentencing enhancement in \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  Notably, \xc2\xa7802(44) includes foreign offenses punishable by more than one year, while \xc2\xa7802(13) includes only federal and state offenses.  Incorporation of \xc2\xa7802(13) into \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in \xc2\xa7802(44)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Furthermore, some States and many foreign jurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors.  See N.\xc2\xa0J. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa72C:1\xe2\x80\x934 (West 2005); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa71252 (Supp. 2007); Brief for United States 35.  Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 compound definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in those jurisdictions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 937 F.\xc2\xa02d 68, 70 (CA2 1991) (relying on New Jersey common law to determine that the State classifies offenses punishable by more than one year as felonies).  No such uncertainty arises under the precise definition Congress provided in \xc2\xa7802(44).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, reading \xc2\xa7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d hardly renders \xc2\xa7802(13) extraneous.  Section 802(13) serves to define \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d for many CSA provisions using that unadorned term.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7824(a)(2) (revocation of license to manufacture controlled substances upon conviction of a felony), 843(b) (use of a communication facility to commit a felony), 843(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (sentencing enhancements), 843(e) (prohibition on engaging in transactions involving listed chemicals upon conviction of a felony involving those chemicals), 848(c)(1) (definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing criminal enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d), 848(e)(1)(B) (mandatory minimum term for killing a law enforcement officer to avoid prosecution for a felony), 853(d) (rebuttable presumption that property acquired during commission of certain felonies is subject to criminal forfeiture), 878(a)(3) (authority to make warrantless arrest where there is probable cause to believe a felony has been committed).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The drafting history of the CSA reinforces our reading of \xc2\xa7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1988, Congress first used the term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the type of prior conviction that would trigger a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  See National Narcotics Leadership Act, Pub. L. 100\xe2\x80\x93690, \xc2\xa76452(a), 102 Stat. 4371.  The 1988 definition of the term was placed within \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) itself; the definition covered \xe2\x80\x9can offense that is a felony under any \xe2\x80\xa6 Federal law \xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6 any law of a State or a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d prohibiting or restricting conduct relating to certain types of drugs.  \xc2\xa76452(a)(2), <em>ibid.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</em>  But in 1994, Congress amended the definition, replacing \xe2\x80\x9can offense that is a <em>felony</em> under \xe2\x80\xa6 any law of a State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added), with \xe2\x80\x9can offense that is <em>punishable by imprisonment for more than one year</em> under any law \xe2\x80\xa6 of a State,\xe2\x80\x9d Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103\xe2\x80\x93322, \xc2\xa790105(c)\xe2\x80\x93(d), 108 Stat. 1988 (emphasis added).  In lieu of incorporation within \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A), the new definition was placed in a discrete \xc2\xa7802 definition section.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This alteration lends considerable support to our reading of the statute.  Before 1994, the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d depended on the vagaries of state-law classifications of offenses as felonies or misdemeanors.  The 1994 amendments replaced that definition with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized length of imprisonment.  By recognizing \xc2\xa7802(44) as the exclusive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense,\xe2\x80\x9d our reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to bring a measure of uniformity to the application of \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) by eliminating disparities based on divergent state classifications of offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, Burgess reads the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition that already required\xe2\x80\x94and, he contends, continues to require\xe2\x80\x94designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction.  That view, however, is difficult to square with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 deletion of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d and substitution of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Burgess were correct, moreover, the sole effect of the 1994 change would have been to exclude from the compass of \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) the few drug offenses classified as felonies under the law of the punishing jurisdiction but subject to a sentence of one year or less.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See also Brief for Petitioner 15 (purpose of 1994 alteration was to eliminate enhancement for \xe2\x80\x9ctruly minor offenses\xe2\x80\x9d nonetheless classified as felonies).  Burgess concedes that under his reading of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cthe language that Congress added [in 1994] has very little practical effect,\xe2\x80\x9d but defends his interpretation on the ground that Congress labeled the changes \xe2\x80\x9cconforming amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.

Treating the amendments as nonsubstantive would be inconsistent with their text, not to mention Burgess\xe2\x80\x99 own view that \xc2\xa7802(44) added a new length-of-imprisonment requirement to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the 1994 alteration replaced a patchwork of state and foreign classifications with a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment.

See Reply Brief 11\xe2\x80\x9312; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In all but one of these examples, however, the definition of the phrase is introduced by the word \xe2\x80\x9cincludes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(4), (6), (7); 18 U.

See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(13), (13A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(44), is incomplete on its face because nothing in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s principal residence\xe2\x80\x9d elucidates the word \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  Given that void and 11 U.
