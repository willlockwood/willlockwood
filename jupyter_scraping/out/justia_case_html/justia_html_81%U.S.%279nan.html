Sometime afterwards, the City of Omaha filed a caveat against Johnson\'s claim, and on the 29th of December, 1859, the commissioner of the land office gave notice to the local register and receiver that Johnson\'s certificate of location had been cancelled.  Thereupon the property was advertised for sale as a part of the public lands.

They insisted on their priority of lien.  The sale took place in August, 1860.  In pursuance of the agreement, Johnson bid off the southern half of the 160 acres at the minimum government price in the name of his mother, and Kellom, on behalf of the creditors, bid off the northern half, each part containing forty acres of the land mortgaged.  Kellom executed conveyances to the other creditors who, with himself, had signed the agreement, so as to divide between them the eighty acres purchased by him, in proportion to their claims against Johnson, and these creditors gave Johnson acquittances in full.

They charged first that the cancellation of Johnson\'s preemption right was procured by his complicity and acquiescence, for the purpose of defrauding them out of their mortgage debt and paying the other creditors, and secondly that when the public sale took place, it was agreed between Johnson and the other creditors who participated in the purchase that Johnson was to have an interest in the purchase proportionate to the claims of those creditors who did not sign the agreement, so that he might afterwards make settlements with them.  All the answers denied these charges; that of the mother alleged further that she was a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser of the eighty acres purchased by her; and those of the other defendants alleged that Kellom was a similar purchaser of the eighty acres purchased by him.  They further insisted that the complainants\' mortgage, or trust deed, being made by Johnson before he obtained a patent for the land, was void by the 12th and 13th sections of the preemption act of September 4th, 1841. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/81/279/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 81 U.

JUSTICE BRADLEY (having stated the case) delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It seems difficult to find any ground for sustaining this appeal.  Conceding that the deed of trust held by the complainants would have been valid as against Johnson and his assigns had his preemption right been sustained, still this right was not sustained.  He had nothing that he could mortgage or convey.  The subsequent sale by the government agents conveyed a good title to the purchasers, clear of the mortgage.  The other ground on which the appellants relied -- namely that at the public sale Johnson had made some reservations in his own favor, in his agreement with the other creditors for the purpose of enabling him to settle with the appellants is taken away by the discovery of a copy of that agreement.  It contains no such provision whatever. On the contrary it is a mutual agreement made for the sole benefit of those who executed it.</p>\n<p>No question arises here in reference to the eighty acres purchased by Johnson\'s mother.  The original decree did not embrace any portion of that, and no appeal from that decree was taken by the complainants.</p>\n<p>Some observations were made in reference to the provision of the agreement looking to a combination to prevent competition in bidding at the government sale, but that objection, if valid, could only be taken by the government itself.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the copy of the agreement which was discovered, and which laid the foundation for the bill of review, is sufficiently proved, and its absence at the former trial is satisfactorily accounted for.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* The case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/291/case.html">Myers v.
