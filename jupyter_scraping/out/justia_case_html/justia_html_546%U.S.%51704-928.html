He was convicted and sentenced to death.  Twice, the Oregon Supreme Court vacated the sentence and ordered new sentencing proceedings, but each time Guzek was again sentenced to death.  Upon vacating his sentence for a third time, the State Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce live alibi testimony from his mother at the upcoming resentencing proceeding.  After this Court granted certiorari, Guzek filed a motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss certiorari is denied.  This Court does not lack jurisdiction on the ground that, irrespective of federal law, state law gives Guzek the right to introduce his mother\xe2\x80\x99s live testimony.  The Court possesses jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257(a), and the Oregon Supreme Court based its legal conclusion in relevant part on such law.  It pointed out that relevant mitigating evidence under state law refers only to evidence that the Federal Constitution grants a defendant the right to present.  And it interpreted the federal admissibility requirement in Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a>, 604 (plurality opinion), and <em>Green</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/95/index.html">442 U.

Nor is this Court willing to dismiss the writ on the ground that irrespective of federal law and of the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s federal holding, Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s capital-case resentencing statute gives Guzek the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phase.  At most, state law <em>might</em> give him such a right, but \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>possible</em> adequate and independent state ground\xe2\x80\x9d for a decision does not \xe2\x80\x9cbar \xe2\x80\xa6 reaching the federal questions\xe2\x80\x9d where, as here, the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cquite clearly rested \xe2\x80\xa6 solely on the Federal Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>California</em> v. <em>Ramos</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/992/index.html">463 U.

Pp. 2\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Constitution does not prohibit a State from limiting the innocence-related evidence a capital defendant can introduce at a sentencing proceeding to the evidence introduced at the original trial.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have <em>not</em> interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing such a defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast \xe2\x80\x9cresidual doubt\xe2\x80\x9d on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction.  <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/index.html">487 U. S. 164</a>, 173, n.\xc2\xa06 (plurality opinion).  <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>,<em> supra</em>, and <em>Green</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <em>supra</em>, distinguished.    Even if such a right existed, it could not extend so far as to provide Guzek with a right to introduce the evidence at issue.  The Eighth Amendment insists upon \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>, 328, and that a sentencing jury be able \xe2\x80\x9cto consider and give effect to mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter or record or the circumstances of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 327\xe2\x80\x93328, but it does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits on the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted.  Three circumstances, taken together, show that the State has the authority to regulate Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s evidence through exclusion.  First, sentencing traditionally concerns <em>how</em>, not <em>whether</em>, a defendant committed the crime, but alibi evidence concerns only <em>whether</em>, not <em>how</em>, he did so.  Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant.  Thus, the evidence attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue.  The law typically discourages such collateral attacks.  Cf. <em>Allen</em> v. <em>McCurry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/index.html">449 U. S. 90</a>, 94.  Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce <em>new</em> alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury <em>all</em> the innocence evidence from the original trial (albeit through transcripts).  The Oregon courts are free to consider on remand whether Guzek is entitled to introduce his mother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to impeach other witnesses whose earlier testimony the government intends to introduce at resentencing.

GUZEK<br/>\n546 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 04-928<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">OREGON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> RANDY LEE GUZEK</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of oregon</p>\n<p align="left">[February 22, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Randy Lee Guzek was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death.  On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.  The question before the Court is whether the State may limit the innocence-related evidence he can introduce at that proceeding to the evidence he introduced at his original trial.  We hold that the limitation does not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Oregon tried Guzek for the offense of capital murder.  The evidence showed that Guzek and two associates decided to burglarize the Houser family home, that they entered the house, that an associate killed Rod Houser, and that Guzek then robbed and killed Lois Houser.  After the police learned that Guzek held a special grudge against the Housers, they traced him and his associates.  The associates confessed.  And they testified at trial, painting Guzek as the ringleader.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s defense rested in part upon an alibi. He presented two alibi witnesses, his grandfather and his mother, who testified that Guzek had been with the one or the other at the time of the crime.  The jury disbelieved the alibi, it convicted Guzek, and it sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Guzek appealed; the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction; but the court ordered a new sentencing proceeding.  Guzek was again sentenced to death; he again appealed; and the Oregon Supreme Court again ordered resentencing.  Guzek was sentenced to death for the third time; he again appealed; and yet again the Oregon Supreme Court found the sentencing procedures faulty.  Seeking to avoid further errors at the next (the fourth) sentencing proceeding, the Oregon Supreme Court also addressed the admissibility of certain evidence Guzek seeks to introduce at that proceeding, including live testimony from his mother about his alibi.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Oregon Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce this evidence at his upcoming sentencing proceeding.  At Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s request, we agreed to review that determination.  544 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before turning to the merits of Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s claim, we consider a motion that Guzek made, asking us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  The motion rests upon Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s claim that, irrespective of federal law, <em>state </em>law gives him the right to introduce his mother\xe2\x80\x99s live testimony\xe2\x80\x94the additional alibi evidence here at issue.  See Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7138.012(2)(b) (2003).  For this reason, he says, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal, or, at the least, there is no good practical reason for us to decide the federal issue.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot agree, however, that we lack jurisdiction to hear the case.  We possess jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257(a).  And the Oregon Supreme Court here based its legal conclusion in relevant part on federal law.  The court pointed out that <em>state</em> law permits the introduction (at a new sentencing hearing) of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>relevant</em> to [the] sentence including . . . mitigating evidence <em>relevant</em> to \xe2\x80\xa6 [w]hether the defendant should receive a death sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 45 (quoting Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7163.150(1)(a), (b) (2003); emphasis added and deleted).  But it immediately added that the state law\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9crelevant \xe2\x80\xa6 mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d refer (in the present context) only to evidence that the <em>Federal Constitution</em> grants a defendant the right to present.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 45\xe2\x80\x9352.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Oregon court went on to discuss this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the effect that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98require that the sentencer \xe2\x80\xa6 not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor \xe2\x80\xa6 any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 54 (quoting <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a>, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion); emphasis deleted); cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56 (recognizing that this aspect of <em>Lockett </em>was adopted by a majority of the Court in <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 110 (1982)).  And the Oregon court then interpreted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Green</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/95/index.html">442 U. S. 95</a> (1979) <em>(per curiam)</em>,<em> </em>as including, within that federal admissibility requirement, evidence which, like the proffered alibi testimony, tends to show that the defendant did not commit the crime for which he has been convicted.  Thus, it held that state law demanded \xe2\x80\x9cadmissibility\xe2\x80\x9d solely for a federal reason.  And we possess jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g., South Dakota</em> v. <em>Neville,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/553/index.html">459 U. S. 553</a>, 556, n. 5 (1983); <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html">440 U. S. 648</a>, 651\xe2\x80\x93653 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither are we persuaded by Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s argument that we should dismiss the case because irrespective of federal law and irrespective of the Oregon Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s federal holding, Oregon law gives him the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phrase; and his mother was such a witness (a fact, he says, that the Oregon Supreme Court overlooked).  Guzek points in support to an Oregon capital-case resentencing statute that says,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a] transcript of all testimony and all exhibits and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial \xe2\x80\xa6 are admissible in the new sentencing proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7138.012(2)(b) (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe provision adds that,</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[e]ither party may recall any witness who testified at the prior trial \xe2\x80\xa6 and may present additional relevant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nWe do not doubt that these provisions give Guzek the state\xe2\x80\x93law right to introduce a transcript </em>of guilt-phase testimony.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (authorizing introduction of transcript of Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s alibi testimony).  But Guzek wishes to do more than introduce a <em>transcript </em>of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>alibi evidence; he wishes to call his mother to the stand as a live witness and elicit <em>additional </em>alibi testimony.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\xe2\x80\x9339, 41, 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  The Oregon statute quoted above does not expressly say whether he may do so.  It does give him the right to \xe2\x80\x9crecall any witness\xe2\x80\x9d who testified at the first trial and to \xe2\x80\x9cpresent additional <em>relevant </em>evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  But is this additional evidence \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d?  The Oregon Supreme Court thought so, but only because <em>federal </em>law insists upon its relevance.  And its opinion suggests that, in the absence of federal compulsion, it would not fall within the scope of the state statutory word \xe2\x80\x9crelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At most, Guzek has shown that state law <em>might, </em>not that it <em>does, </em>independently give him the right to introduce this evidence.  We have made clear that \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>possible </em>adequate and independent state ground\xe2\x80\x9d for a decision does not \xe2\x80\x9cbar [our] reaching the federal questions\xe2\x80\x9d where, as here, a \xe2\x80\x9cState Supreme Court quite clearly rested its [decision] solely on the Federal Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>California</em> v. <em>Ramos,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/992/index.html">463 U. S. 992</a>, 997, n. 7 (1983); see also <em>City of Revere</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hospital,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/239/index.html">463 U.

And we consequently deny the motion to dismiss the writ.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As our discussion in Part II,<em> supra,</em> makes clear, the federal question before us is a narrow one.  Do the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments grant Guzek a constitutional right to present evidence of the kind he seeks to introduce, namely <em>new</em> evidence that shows he was not present at the scene of the crime.  That evidence is <em>inconsistent</em> with Guzek\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction.  It sheds no light on <em>the manner </em>in which<em> </em>he committed the crime for which he has been convicted.  Nor is it evidence that Guzek contends was unavailable to him at the time of the original trial.  And, to the extent it is evidence he introduced at that time, he is free to introduce it now, albeit in transcript form.  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7138.012(2)(b) (2003).  We can find nothing in the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments that provides a capital defendant a right to introduce new evidence of this kind at sentencing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that our previous cases have found in the Eighth Amendment a constitutional right broad enough to encompass the evidence here at issue.  In <em>Lockett </em>v.<em> Ohio, supra</em>, a plurality of this Court decided that a defendant convicted of acting in concert with others to rob and to kill could introduce at the sentencing stage evidence that she had played a minor role in the crime, indeed, that she had remained outside the shop (where the killing took place) at the time of the crime.  A plurality of the Court wrote that,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record and <em>any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers</em> as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 604 (emphasis added and deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd in <em>Eddings </em>v.<em> Oklahoma, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>,<em> </em>the Court majority adopted this statement.  See also <em>McCleskey</em> v. <em>Kemp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/279/index.html">481 U. S. 279</a>, 306 (1987); <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/637/index.html">438 U. S. 637</a>, 642 (1978) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the evidence at issue in these cases was traditional sentence-related evidence, evidence that tended to show <em>how, </em>not <em>whether, </em>the defendant committed the crime.  Nor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Oregon Supreme Court thought that this latter distinction\xe2\x80\x94the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9calibi evidence was inconsistent with,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with[,] the underlying convictions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94did not matter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 58.  It said that this \xe2\x80\x9cfactual distinction \xe2\x80\xa6 is of no consequence in light of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Green</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Georgia.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>In <em>Green, </em>however, the Court focused upon a defendant convicted of murder, who sought to introduce at sentencing a statement his confederate made to a third party that he (the confederate) had alone committed the murder (<em>i.e.</em>, without the defendant).  The State opposed its use at the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing hearing<em> on the ground that, as to the defendant, it was hearsay.  </em>The Court, in a brief <em>per curiam</em> opinion, noted that the State had used the confession in the confederate\xe2\x80\x99s trial, referred to an earlier case holding that the Constitution forbids States from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mechanistically\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d applying the hearsay rule \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to defeat the ends of justice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and held that the Constitution prohibited the State from barring use of the confession.  442 U.

The opinion focused only upon the hearsay problem, and it implicitly assumed that, in the absence of the hearsay problem, <em>state</em> law would not have blocked admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>In any event, subsequent to <em>Green, </em>this Court decided <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/index.html">487 U. S. 164</a> (1988) (plurality opinion), and that case makes clear, contrary to the Oregon Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding, that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous cases<em> </em>had <em>not</em> interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing a capital defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast \xe2\x80\x9cresidual doubt\xe2\x80\x9d on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction.  The <em>Franklin</em> plurality said it was \xe2\x80\x9cquite doubtful\xe2\x80\x9d that any such right existed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, n.\xc2\xa06.  And two other Members of the Court added that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur cases\xe2\x80\x9d do not support any such \xe2\x80\x9cright to reconsideration by the sentencing body of lingering doubts about \xe2\x80\xa6 guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 187 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  See also <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U.

S.em&gt;., at 174.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements on the matter make clear that the Oregon Supreme Court erred in interpreting <em>Green</em> as providing a capital defendant with a constitutional right to introduce residual doubt evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we once again face a situation where we need not resolve whether such a right exists, for, even if it does, it could not extend so far as to provide this defendant with a right to introduce the evidence at issue.

S. 450</a>, 461\xe2\x80\x93462 (1945). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eighth Amendment insists upon \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Penry, supra,</em> at 328 (quoting <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html">428 U. S. 280</a>, 305 (1976) (plurality opinion)).  The Eighth Amendment also insists that a sentencing jury be able \xe2\x80\x9cto consider and give effect to mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter or record or the circumstances of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Penry, supra,</em> at 327\xe2\x80\x93328.  But the Eighth Amendment does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cStates are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence \xe2\x80\x98in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a>, 377 (1990) (quoting <em>Franklin, supra</em>, at 181 (plurality opinion)); see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/350/index.html">509 U. S. 350</a>, 362 (1993); <em>California</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/index.html">479 U. S. 538</a>, 543 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three circumstances, taken together, convince us that the State possesses the authority to regulate, through exclusion, the evidence that Guzek seeks to present.  First, sentencing traditionally concerns <em>how, </em>not <em>whether, </em>a defendant committed the crime.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa71A1.1, editorial note, \xc2\xa74(a), p. 4 (Nov. 2004).  But the evidence at issue here\xe2\x80\x94alibi evidence\xe2\x80\x94concerns only <em>whether, </em>not <em>how, </em>he did so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant\xe2\x80\x94whether the defendant committed the basic crime.  The evidence thereby attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue.  The law typically discourages collateral attacks of this kind.  Cf. <em>Allen</em> v. <em>McCurry,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/index.html">449 U. S. 90</a>, 94 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs this Court and other courts have often recognized, res judicata and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce <em>new </em>alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury <em>all</em> the evidence of innocence from the original trial regardless.  That law permits the defendant to introduce at resentencing transcripts and exhibits from his prior trial.  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7138.012(2)(b) (2003).  The defendant here has not claimed that the evidence at issue was unavailable at the time of his original trial.  Thus, he need only have introduced it at that time to guarantee its presentation (albeit through transcripts) to a resentencing jury as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legitimacy of these trial management and evidentiary considerations, along with the typically minimal adverse impact that a restriction would have on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to present his alibi claim at resentencing convinces us that the Eighth Amendment does not protect defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to present the evidence at issue here.  We conclude that the Oregon court was wrong in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Guzek also contends that, even if the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not mandate the admission of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, he is entitled to introduce that evidence to impeach his associates, whose earlier testimony the government intends to introduce at resentencing.  The Oregon Supreme Court did not address this issue; nor do we believe it fairly encompassed within the question presented.  The Oregon courts are free to consider it on remand should they believe it appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>\n<right>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>It is so ordered.<right></right></em></right></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito</em> took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962013">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nOREGON V. GUZEK<br/>\n546 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 04-928<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">OREGON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> RANDY LEE GUZEK</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of oregon</p>\n<p align="left">[February 22, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we have the opportunity to put to rest, once for all, the mistaken notion that the Eighth Amendment requires that a convicted capital defendant be given the opportunity, at his sentencing hearing, to present evidence and argument concerning residual doubts about his guilt.  Although the Court correctly holds that there is no Eighth Amendment violation in this case, I would follow the Court\xe2\x80\x99s logic to its natural conclusion and reject all Eighth Amendment residual-doubt claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that we have jurisdiction and should exercise it in this case.  What requires me to withhold agreement to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is the last of the \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hree circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d on which it relies, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury <em>all</em> the evidence of innocence from the original trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (emphasis in original).  The first two of the circumstances are alone sufficient to dispose of the claim that the Eighth Amendment guarantees a capital defendant a <em>second</em> opportunity, at sentencing, to litigate his innocence.  In fact, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s third \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance\xe2\x80\x9d is an analytical misfit in the company of the other two.  The first two\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9csentencing traditionally concerns <em>how,</em> not <em>whether</em>, a defendant committed the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.\xe2\x80\x94show that compelling the admission of innocence-related evidence would be <em>improper</em> and <em>unnecessary</em> at a sentencing hearing.  The third, by contrast, suggests that there is no constitutional violation in this case because <em>enough</em> of such evidence may be admitted on remand.  The latter factor would be relevant only if the former two were not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we needed any third factor to justify our holding, a better candidate would be that the claim we consider here finds no support in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s legal history and traditions.  In 1986, Justice Marshall correctly observed that there had been \xe2\x80\x9cfew times in which any legitimacy has been given to the power of a convicted capital defendant facing the possibility of a death sentence to argue as a mitigating factor the chance that he might be innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lockhart</em> v. <em>McCree</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/index.html">476 U. S. 162</a>, 205 (dissenting opinion).  Nothing has changed on that score in the last 20 years.  On the contrary, in <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/index.html">487 U. S. 164</a> (1988), four Members of this Court noted that our \xe2\x80\x9cprior decisions . . . fail to recognize a constitutional right to have such doubts considered as a mitigating factor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 174 (plurality opinion).  They were, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cquite doubtful\xe2\x80\x9d that the purported right existed, because it is \xe2\x80\x9carguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death sentence\xe2\x80\x94but not the underlying conviction\xe2\x80\x94is struck down on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, n.\xc2\xa06.  Two other Members of the Court would have rejected the claim outright.  <em>Id.</em>, at 187 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After <em>Franklin</em>, the lower courts have unanimously denied constitutional claims like the one we consider today.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ziegler</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, 345 F.\xc2\xa03d 1300, 1310 (CA11 2003); <em>Evans</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 117, 121 (CA4 1989); <em>Duest</em> v. <em>State</em>, 855 So.\xc2\xa02d 33, 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (Fla. 2003); <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Fisher</em>, 572 Pa. 105, 115\xe2\x80\x93116, 813 A.\xc2\xa02d 761, 767 (2002); <em>People</em> v. <em>Emerson</em>, 189 Ill. 2d 436, 501\xe2\x80\x93504, 727 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 302, 338\xe2\x80\x93339 (2000); <em>State</em> v. <em>Fletcher</em>, 354 N.\xc2\xa0C. 455, 470\xe2\x80\x93472, 555 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 534, 544 (2001); <em>Melson</em> v. <em>State</em>, 775 So.\xc2\xa02d 857, 898\xe2\x80\x93899 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999).  The last apparent scrap of authority for the contrary view came from our cryptic opinion in <em>Green</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/95/index.html">442 U. S. 95</a> (1979) <em>(per curiam),</em> on which the Oregon Supreme Court principally relied.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58\xe2\x80\x9362.  The chief virtue of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion lies in its discarding the notion that <em>Green</em> provides any support for an Eighth Amendment right to argue residual doubt at sentencing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In mentioning, however, the superfluous circumstance that Oregon law happens to provide for the admission at sentencing of <em>some</em> evidence that relates to innocence, the Court risks creating doubt where none should exist.  Capital defendants might now be tempted to argue that the <em>amount</em> of residual-doubt evidence carried over from\nthe guilt phase in their sentencing hearings is insufficient to satisfy the Court\xe2\x80\x99s third factor.  Every one of these \xe2\x80\x9cresidual-doubt\xe2\x80\x9d claims will be meritless in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first two factors.  We should make this perfectly clear today.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
