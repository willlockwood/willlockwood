Von Schmidt in 1872 as an eight (8) inch square wood post set in a large mound of stone at the intersection to the 42nd parallel of north latitude along the southern boundary of the State of Oregon and the 120th degree of longitude west from Greenwich, each as reported by him; thence running southerly along said 1872 boundary as surveyed and marked by Allexey W. Von Schmidt to a cast iron monument designated as Von Schmidt Milepost 191 on said boundary; thence S 00\xef\xbf\xbd09\'15".21 W along a line directed toward a standard National Geodetic Survey brass marker cemented in a granite formation and stamped "VS 120, 1981", located at the geographic position of:  Latitude 38\xef\xbf\xbd53\'51".59866 Longitude 120\xef\xbf\xbd00\'20".93116, a distance Of 80,191.63 feet to an intersection in Lake Tahoe with a line extending between two points, the first of which is a standard National Geodetic Survey brass marker cemented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="868">Page 456 U.
