Thereafter appellant Duquesne Light Co. applied to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to obtain a rate increase and to amortize its expenditures on the canceled plants over 10 years.  The PUC granted a rate increase that included an amount representing the first payment of the 10-year amortized recovery of Duquesne\'s costs in the aborted plants.  Shortly before the close of the rate proceeding, a state law (Act 335) was enacted that provided that an electric utility\'s cost of construction of a generating facility shall not be made part of a ratebase nor otherwise included in rates charged until such time as the facility "is used and useful in service to the public."  The State Office of the Consumer Advocate moved the PUC to reconsider in light of this law, but the PUC, on reconsideration, affirmed its original rate order, reading the new law as excluding the costs of canceled plants from the ratebase, but not as preventing their recovery through amortization.  Meanwhile, the PUC similarly granted appellant Pennsylvania Power Co. a rate increase, and authorized it to amortize its share of the canceled plants over a 10-year period.  The Consumer Advocate appealed both PUC decisions to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which held that the PUC had correctly construed Act 336.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed, holding that Act 336 prohibited recovery of the costs in question either by inclusion in the ratebase or by amortization, and that the statute did not take appellants\' property in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that such a law did not take the utilities\' property in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  We agree with that conclusion, and hold that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 488 U. S. 302</a></p><p> state scheme of utility regulation does not "take" property simply because it disallows recovery of capital investments that are not "used and useful in service to the public."  66 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1315 (Supp.1988).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In response to predictions of increased demand for electricity, Duquesne Light Company (Duquesne) and Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn Power) joined a venture in 1967 to build more generating capacity.  The project, known as the Central Area Power Coordination Group (CAPCO), involved three other electric utilities and had as its objective the construction of seven large nuclear generating units.  In 1980, the participants canceled plans for construction of four of the plants.  Intervening events, including the Arab oil embargo and the accident at Three Mile Island, had radically changed the outlook both for growth in the demand for electricity and for nuclear energy as a desirable way of meeting that demand.  At the time of the cancellation, Duquesne\'s share of the preliminary construction costs associated with the four halted plants was $34,697,389.  Penn Power had invested $9,569,665.</p>\n<p>In 1980, and again in 1981, Duquesne sought permission from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] to recoup its expenditures for the unbuilt plants over a 10-year period.  The Commission deferred ruling on the request until it received the report from its investigation of the CAPCO construction.  That report was issued in late 1982.  The report found that Duquesne and Penn Power could not be faulted for initiating the construction of more nuclear generating capacity at the time they joined the CAPCO project in 1967.  The projections at that time indicated a growing demand </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 488 U. S. 303</a></p><p> for electricity and a cost advantage to nuclear capacity.  It also found that the intervening events which ultimately confounded the predictions could not have been predicted, and that work on the four nuclear plants was stopped at the proper time.  In summing up, the Administrative Law Judge found "that the CAPCO decisions in regard to the [canceled plants] at every stage to their cancellation, were reasonable and prudent."  App. to Juris. Statement 19h.  He recommended that Duquesne and Penn Power be allowed to amortize their sunk costs in the project over a 10-year period.  The PUC adopted the conclusions of the report.  App. to Juris. Statement 1i.</p>\n<p>In 1982, Duquesne again came before the PUC to obtain a rate increase.  Again, it sought to amortize its expenditures on the canceled plants over 10 years.  In January, 1988, the PUC issued a final order which granted Duquesne the authority to increase its revenues $106.8 million to a total yearly revenue in excess of $800 million.  <em>Pennsylvania PUC v. Duquesne Light Co.,</em> 67 Pa. P.U.C. 1, 51 P.U.R. 4th 198 (1983).  The rate increase included $3.6 million in revenue representing the first payment of the 10-year amortization of Duquesne\'s $36 million loss in the CAPCO plants.</p>\n<p>The Pennsylvania Office of the Consumer Advocate (Consumer Advocate) moved the PUC for reconsideration in light of a state law enacted about a month before the close of the 1982 Duquesne rate proceeding.  The Act, No. 336, 1982 Pa. Laws 1473, amended the Pennsylvania Utility Code by limiting "the consideration of certain costs in the ratebase." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 488 U. S. 304</a></p><p> It provided that</p>\n<p>"the cost of construction or expansion of a facility undertaken by a public utility producing . . . electricity shall not be made a part of the ratebase nor otherwise included in the rates charged by the electric utility until such time as the facility is used and useful in service to the public."</p>\n<p>66 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1315 (Supp.1988).  On reconsideration, the PUC affirmed its original rate order.  <em>Pennsylvania PUC v. Duquesne Light Co.,</em> 57 Pa.P.U.C. 177, 52 P.U.R. 4th 644 (1983).  It read the new law as excluding the costs of canceled plants (obviously not used and useful) from the ratebase, but not as preventing their recovery through amortization.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another CAPCO member, Penn Power, also sought to amortize its share of the canceled CAPCO power plants over a 10-year period.  The PUC granted Penn Power authority to increase its revenues by $15.4 million, to a total of $184.2 million.  <em>Pennsylvania PUC v. Pennsylvania Power Co.,</em> 58 Pa.P.U.C. 305, 60 P.U.R. 4th 593 (1984).  Part of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 488 U. S. 305</a></p><p> that revenue increase represented $956,967 for the first year of the 10-year amortized recovery of Penn Power\'s costs in the aborted nuclear plants.</p>\n<p>The Consumer Advocate appealed both of these decisions to the Commonwealth Court, which by a divided vote held that the Commission had correctly construed \xc2\xa7 1315.  <em>Cohen v. Pennsylvania PUC,</em> 90 Pa.Comw. 98, 494 A.2d 58 (1985).  The Consumer Advocate then appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and that court reversed.  <em>Barasch v. Pennsylvania PUC,</em> 516 Pa. 142, 532 A.2d 325 (1987).  That court held that the controlling language of the Act prohibited recovery of the costs in question either by inclusion in the ratebase or by amortization.  The Supreme Court rejected appellants\' constitutional challenge to the statute thus interpreted, observing that</p>\n<p>"[t]he \'just compensation\' safeguarded to a utility by the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution is a reasonable return on the fair value of its property at the time it is being used for public service."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163, 532 A.2d at 335.  Since the instant CAPCO investment was not serving the public and did not constitute an operating expense, no constitutional rights to recovery attached to it.  The court remanded to the PUC for further proceedings to correct its rate order, giving effect to the exclusion required by Act 335. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Duquesne and Penn Power appealed to this Court, arguing that the effect of Act 335 excluding their prudently incurred costs from the rate violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has finally adjudicated the constitutionality of Act 335 in the context of otherwise completed rate proceedings, and so has left "the outcome of further proceedings preordained."  <em>Cox, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#479">420 U. S. 479</a></span>.  We do not think that the PUC might undo the effects of Act 335 on remand by allowing recovery of the disputed costs in some other way consistent with state law.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\'s interpretation of the Act does not leave its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 488 U.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We are satisfied that we are presented with the State\'s last word on the constitutionality of Act 335, and that all that remains is the straightforward application of its clear directive to otherwise complete rate Orders.  We therefore have jurisdiction.  <em>See Cox, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#479">420 U. S. 479</a></span>; <em>Mills v.

A Pennsylvania statute provides that "[e]very public utility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, safe, and reasonable service and facilities" and that "[s]uch service also shall be reasonably continuous and without unreasonable interruptions or delay."  66 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1501 (1986).  Although their assets are employed in the public interest to provide consumers of the State with electric power, they are owned and operated by private investors.  This partly public, partly private status of utility property creates its own set of questions under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The guiding principle has been that the Constitution protects utilities from being limited to a charge for their property serving the public which is so "unjust" as to be confiscatory.  <em>Covington &amp; Lexington Turnpike Road Co. v.

This method, known as the "fair value" rule, is exemplified by the decision in <em>Smyth v.

S. 547</a></span>.  In theory, the <em>Smyth v. Ames</em> fair value standard mimics the operation of the competitive market.  To the extent utilities\' investments in plants are good ones (because their benefits exceed their costs), they are rewarded with an opportunity to earn an "above-cost" return, that is, a fair return on the current "market value" of the plant.  To the extent utilities\' investments turn out to be bad ones (such as plants that are canceled and so never used and useful to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 488 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In response to these problems, Justice Brandeis had advocated an alternative approach as the constitutional minimum, what has become known as the "prudent investment" or "historical cost" rule.  He accepted the <em>Smyth v. Ames</em> eminent domain analogy, but concluded that what was "taken" by public utility regulation is not specific physical assets that are to be individually valued, but the capital prudently devoted to the public utility enterprise by the utilities\' owners.  <em>Missouri ex rel.

Under the prudent investment rule, the utility is compensated for all prudent investments at their actual cost when made (their "historical" cost), irrespective of whether individual investments are deemed necessary or beneficial in hindsight.  The utilities incur fewer risks, but are limited to a standard rate of return on the actual amount of money reasonably invested.

This language, of course, does not dispense with all of the constitutional difficulties when a utility raises a claim that the rate which it is permitted to charge is so low as to be confiscatory:  whether a particular rate is "unjust" or "unreasonable" will depend to some extent on what is a fair rate of return, given the risks under a particular ratesetting system, and on the amount of capital upon which the investors are entitled to earn that return.  At the margins, these questions have constitutional overtones.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania determines rates under a slightly modified form of the historical cost/prudent investment system.

In fact, the overall effect is well within the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 488 U. S. 312</a></p><p> bounds of <em>Hope,</em> even with total exclusion of the CAPCO costs.  Duquesne was authorized to earn a 16.14% return on common equity and an 11.64% overall return on a ratebase of nearly $1.8 billion.  <em>See Pennsylvania PUC v. Duquesne Light Co.,</em> 57 Pa.P.U.C. at 51, 51 P.U.R.4th at 243.  Its $35 million investment in the canceled plants comprises roughly 1.9% of its total base.  The denial of plant amortization will reduce its annual allowance by .4%.  Similarly, Penn Power was allowed a charge of 15.72% return on common equity and a 12.02% overall return.  Its investment in the CAPCO plants comprises only 2.4% of its $401.8 million ratebase.  <em>See Pennsylvania PUC v. Pennsylvania Power Co.,</em> 58 Pa.P.U.C. at 331-332, 60 P.U.R.4th at 618.  The denial of amortized recovery of its $9.6 million investment in CAPCO will reduce its annual revenue allowance by only .5%.</p>\n<p>Given these numbers, it appears that the PUC would have acted within the constitutional range of reasonableness if it had allowed amortization of the CAPCO costs but set a lower rate of return on equity, with the result that Duquesne and Penn Power received the same revenue they will under the instant orders on remand.  The overall impact of the rate orders, then, is not constitutionally objectionable.  No argument has been made that these slightly reduced rates jeopardize the financial integrity of the companies, either by leaving them insufficient operating capital or by impeding their ability to raise future capital.  Nor has it been demonstrated that these rates are inadequate to compensate current equity holders for the risk associated with their investments under a modified prudent investment scheme.

S. 313</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Instead, appellants argue that the Constitution requires that subsidiary aspects of Pennsylvania\'s ratemaking methodology be examined piecemeal.  One aspect which they find objectionable is the constraint Act 335 places on the PUC\'s decisions.  They urge that such legislative direction to the PUC impermissibly interferes with the PUC\'s duty to balance consumer and investor interest under <em>Permian Basin,</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/747/case.html#792">390 U. S. 792</a></span>.  Appellants also note the theoretical inconsistency of Act 335, suddenly and selectively applying the used and useful requirement, normally associated with the fair value approach, in the context of Pennsylvania\'s system based on historical cost.  Neither of the errors appellants perceive in this case is of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p>It cannot seriously be contended that the Constitution prevents state legislatures from giving specific instructions to their utility commissions.  We have never doubted that state legislatures are competent bodies to set utility rates.  And the Pennsylvania PUC is essentially an administrative arm of the legislature.  <em>See, e.g., Barasch v. Pennsylvania PUC,</em> 516 Pa. at 171, 532 A.2d at 339 ("The Commission is but an instrumentality of the state legislature for the performance of [ratemaking]"); <em>Minnesota Rate Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/230/352/case.html">230 U.

This is not to say that any system of ratemaking applied by a utilities commission, including the specific instructions it has received from its legislature, will necessarily be constitutional.  But if the system fails to pass muster, it will not be because the legislature has performed part of the work.</p>\n<p>Similarly, an otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that produced it.  "It is not theory, but the impact of the rate order which counts."  <em>Hope,</em> 320 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/591/case.html#602">320 U. S. 602</a></span>.  The economic judgments required in rate proceedings are often hopelessly complex, and do not admit of a single correct result.  The Constitution is not designed to arbitrate these economic niceties.  Errors to the detriment of one party may well be canceled out by countervailing errors or allowances in another part of the rate proceeding.  The Constitution protects the utility from the net effect of the rate order on its property.  Inconsistencies in one aspect of the methodology have no constitutional effect on the utility\'s property if they are compensated by countervailing factors in some other aspect.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the impact of certain rates can only be evaluated in the context of the system under which they are imposed.  One of the elements always relevant to setting the rate under <em>Hope</em> is the return investors expect given the risk of the enterprise.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/591/case.html#603">320 U.

The risks a utility faces are in large part defined by the rate methodology, because utilities are virtually always public monopolies dealing in an essential service, and so relatively immune to the usual market risks.  Consequently, a State\'s decision to arbitrarily switch back and forth between methodologies in a way which required investors to bear the risk of bad investments at some times while denying them the benefit of good investments at others would raise serious constitutional questions.  But the instant case does not present this question.  At all relevant times, Pennsylvania\'s rate system has been predominantly, but not entirely, based on historical cost, and it has not been shown that the rate orders as modified by Act 335 fail to give a reasonable rate of return on equity given the risks under such a regime.  We therefore hold that Act 335\'s limited effect on the rate order at issue does not result in a constitutionally impermissible rate.</p>\n<p>Finally we address the suggestion of the Pennsylvania Electric Association as <em>amicus</em> that the prudent investment rule should be adopted as the constitutional standard.  We think that the adoption of any such rule would signal a retreat from 45 years of decisional law in this area which would be as unwarranted as it would be unsettling.  <em>Hope</em> clearly held that "the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates."  320 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/591/case.html#602">320 U.

The exchange value of a utility\'s assets, such as power plants, could not be set by a market price, because such assets were rarely bought and sold.  Nor could the capital assets be valued by the stream of income they produced, because setting that stream of income was the very object of the rate proceeding.  According to Brandeis, the <em>Smyth v.

As provided by 66 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1311(b) (1986),</p>\n<p>"[t]he value of the property of the public utility included in the ratebase shall be the original cost of the property when first devoted to the public service less the applicable accrued depreciation."</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the PUC declared in Duquesne\'s rate proceeding that "we shall adopt as the fair value of the respondent\'s ratebase, the original cost measure of value."  <em>Pennsylvania PUC v. Duquesne Light Co.,</em> 57 Pa.P.U.C. 1, 5, 51 P.U.R.4th 198, 202 (1983).  So too in Penn Power\'s case.  <em>See Pennsylvania PUC v.

The cost of each component of the utility\'s capital is considered, <em>i.e.,</em></p>\n<p>"the cost of debt, the cost of preferred stock, and the cost of common stock[,] [t]he latter being determined by the return required to sell such stock upon reasonable terms in the market."</p>\n<p><em>Pennsylvania PUC v.

It then exercises "informed judgment" to set the total rate of return based on these component costs of capital.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See also Pennsylvania PUC v. Pennsylvania Power, supra,</em> at 325-326, 60 P.U.R.4th at 611-621.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the rate based on capital, then, represents a return (set by costs of capital) on a ratebase (determined by historical cost).  These are features of the historical cost/prudent investment system.  Pennsylvania has modified the system in several instances, however, when prudent investments will never be used and useful.  For such occurrences, it has allowed amortization of the capital lost, but does not allow the utility to earn a return on that investment.  <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania PUC v. Metropolitan Edison Co.,</em> 55 Pa.P.U.C. 478, 486 (1982) (amortization of company\'s investment in contaminated Three Mile Island Unit 2); <em>Philadelphia Electric Co. v. Pennsylvania PUC,</em> 61 Pa.Comw. 325, 433 A.2d 620 (1981) (excluding from the ratebase a portion of a utility\'s generating plant that was excess capacity, but allowing recovery of the operating expenses, including depreciation charges on the entire plants); <em>UGI Corp. v. Pennsylvania PUC,</em> 49 Pa.Comw. 69, 410 A.2d 923 (1980) (permitting amortization of terminated feasibility studies); <em>Pennsylvania PUC v. Philadelphia Electric Co.,</em> 46 Pa.P.U.C. 746, 750 (1973) (10-year amortization of unusual expenses caused by tropical storm).  The loss to utilities from prudent but ultimately unsuccessful investments under such a system is greater than under a pure prudent investment rule, but less than under a fair value approach.  Pennsylvania\'s modification slightly increases the overall risk of investments in utilities over the pure prudent investment rule.  Presumably the PUC adjusts the risk premium element of the rate of return on equity accordingly.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Duquesne\'s embedded cost of debt was 9.42%.  <em>Pennsylvania PUC v.

Texaco Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/380/case.html">417 U.

I think it important to observe, however, that while "prudent investment" (by which I mean capital reasonably expended to meet the utility\'s legal obligation to assure adequate service) need not be taken into account as such in ratemaking formulas, it may need to be taken into account in assessing the constitutionality of the particular consequences produced by those formulas.  We cannot determine whether the payments a utility has been allowed to collect constitute a fair return on investment, and thus whether the government\'s action is confiscatory, unless we agree upon what the relevant "investment" is.  For that purpose, all prudently incurred investment may well have to be counted.  As the Court\'s opinion describes, that question is not presented in the present suit, which challenges techniques, rather than consequences.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court, I fear, because of what it regards as the investment of time in having this case argued and briefed, is strong-arming the finality concept and finding a <em>Cox</em> exception that does not exist.  We have jurisdiction, under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257, only if there is a "final judgment" by the "highest court of a State" in which a decision could be had.  To be sure, we have interpreted \xc2\xa7 1257 somewhat flexibly to the effect that the finality requirement is satisfied in four discrete situations despite the need of further proceedings in the state courts:  <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html">420 U. S. 469</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#477">420 U. S. 477</a></span> (1975). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 488 U. S. 318</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court here concludes that this case falls within the first of the four <em>Cox</em> exceptions ("the outcome of further proceedings preordained," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#479">420 U. S. 479</a></span>).  With all respect, I disagree, for this case concerns rates, and there is no rate order whatsoever before this Court.  The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania invalidated the rate orders set by the Pennsylvania Commission, and remanded the cases for further ratemaking.  The Court deludes itself when it speaks of preordination of the Commission\'s further action.  New rates will be set, based upon factors we do not as yet know, and only then will a final judgment possibly emerge in due course.</p>\n<p>I therefore would dismiss the appeal for want of the final judgment that \xc2\xa7 1257 requires.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
