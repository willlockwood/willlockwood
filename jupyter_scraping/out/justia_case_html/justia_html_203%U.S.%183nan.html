Every such corporation shall, by power of attorney, duly executed, acknowledged, and filed in the auditor\'s office of this state, appoint said auditor and his successors in office attorney in fact to accept service of process and notice in this state for such corporations, and by the same instrument it shall declare its consent that service of any process or notice in this state on said attorney in fact or his acceptance thereof indorsed thereon, shall be equivalent for all purposes to, and shall be and constitute, due and legal service upon said corporation."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.

And all such corporations as have heretofore taken out charters, or procured authority to do business in this state, shall, for the fiscal year </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 203 U. S. 187</a></p><p> commencing on the first day of May, 1905, pay the sum of ten dollars to the auditor as the fee for such attorney to receive service of process, and annually thereafter a like sum, and such corporation shall not be required to pay any fee to the person who may have been heretofore appointed its attorney to receive service of process.  All moneys received by the auditor under this chapter shall belong to the state, and be by him immediately paid into the state treasury.  The auditor shall keep in a well bound book in his office a true and accurate account of all moneys so received and paid over to him."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 3.  The post office address of such corporation shall be filed with the power of attorney, and there shall be filed with the auditor from time to time statements of any changes of address of said corporation.  Immediately after being served with or accepting any such process or notice, the auditor shall make and file with said power of attorney a copy of such process or notice, with a note thereon indorsed of the time of service or acceptance, as the case may be, and transmit such process or notice by registered mail to such corporation at the address last furnished as aforesaid.  But no such process or notice shall be served on the auditor or accepted by him less than ten days before the return thereof."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 4.  In addition to the auditor, any such company may designate any other person in this state as its attorney in fact upon whom service of process or notice may be made or who may accept such service.  And, when such local attorney is appointed, process in any suit or proceeding may be served on him to the same effect as if the same were served on the auditor."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 5.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is argued that the Act of February 22, 1905, is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment in that it deprives the company of liberty of contract and property without due process of law, and denies it the equal protection of the laws.  But in view of repeated decisions of this Court, the contention is without merit.  The state had the clear right to regulate its own creations, and <em>a fortiori,</em> foreign corporations permitted to transact business within its borders.</p>\n<p>In this instance, it put all nonresident domestic corporations, which elected to have their places of business and works outside of the state, and all foreign corporations coming into the state, on the same footing in respect of the service of process, and the law operated on all these alike.</p>\n<p>Such a classification was reasonable, and not open to constitutional objection.  <em>Orient Insurance Company v.

And we agree with the state court that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 203 U. S. 192</a></p><p> requirement of the payment of ten dollars to the auditor for the use of the state does not amount to a taking of property without due process, or an unjust discrimination.  <em>Charlotte Railroad v.
