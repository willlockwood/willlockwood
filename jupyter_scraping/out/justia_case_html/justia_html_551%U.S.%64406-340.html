Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) requires federal agencies to consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that a proposed agency action is unlikely to jeopardize an endangered or threatened species.  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administer the ESA.  Once a consultation process is complete, a written biological opinion is issued, which may suggest alternative actions to protect a jeopardized species or its critical habitat.  When Arizona officials sought EPA authorization to administer the State\xe2\x80\x99s NPDES program, the EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer would adversely affect any listed species.  The FWS regional office wanted potential impacts taken into account, but the EPA disagreed, finding that \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory nature stripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  The dispute was referred to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 national offices for resolution.  The FWS\xe2\x80\x99s biological opinion concluded that the requested transfer would not jeopardize listed species.  The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s nine criteria and approved the transfer, noting that the biological opinion had concluded the consultation \xe2\x80\x9crequired\xe2\x80\x9d by ESA \xc2\xa77(a)(2).  Respondents sought review in the Ninth Circuit, petitioner National Association of Home Builders intervened, and part of respondent Defenders of Wildlife\xe2\x80\x99s separate action was consolidated with the suit.  The court held that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s transfer approval was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA had relied on contradictory positions regarding its \xc2\xa77(a)(2) responsibilities during the administrative process.  Rather than remanding the case for the agency to explain its decision, however, the court reviewed the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive construction of the statutes.  It did not dispute that Arizona had met CWA \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s nine criteria, but nevertheless concluded that ESA \xc2\xa77(a)(2) required the EPA to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize listed species, in effect adding a tenth criterion.  The court dismissed the argument that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval was not subject to \xc2\xa77(a)(2) because it was not a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary action\xe2\x80\x9d under 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03, \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s interpretative regulation.  The court thus vacated the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s transfer decision.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.  This Court will not vacate an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard unless the agency \xe2\x80\x9crelied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/29/index.html">463 U. S. 29</a>, 43<em>.</em>  Here, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision was internally inconsistent in its statements during the review process.  Federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agency\xe2\x80\x99s <em>final</em> action, and the fact that a local agency representative\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary determination is later overruled at a higher agency level does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s final approval notice stating that \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s required consultation process had been concluded may be inconsistent with its previously expressed position\xe2\x80\x94and position in this litigation\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s consultation requirement is not triggered by a \xc2\xa7402 transfer application, but that is not the type of error requiring a remand.  By the time the statement was issued, the EPA and FWS had already consulted, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required </em>was not germane to the final agency decision.  Thus, this Court need not further delay the permitting authority transfer by remanding to the agency for clarification.  Respondents suggest that the EPA nullified their right to participate in the application proceedings by altering its legal position during the pendency of the transfer decision and its associated litigation, but they do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during the comment period made available under the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions, it does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0At first glance the legislative commands here are irreconcilable.  Section 402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshall approve\xe2\x80\x9d language is mandatory and its list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.  Section 7(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s similarly imperative language would literally add a tenth criterion to \xc2\xa7402(b).

S. 148</a>, 153.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) would effectively repeal \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d issue a permit whenever all nine exclusive statutory prerequisites are met.  Section 402(b) does not just set <em>minimum</em> requirements; it affirmatively mandates a transfer\xe2\x80\x99s approval, thus operating as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuit raises that floor and alters the statute\xe2\x80\x99s command.  Read broadly, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction would also partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it not jeopardize listed species.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Title 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03, promulgated by the NMFS and FWS and applying \xc2\xa77(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cto all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), harmonizes the CWA and ESA by giving effect to the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  The Court owes \xe2\x80\x9csome degree of deference to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the ESA, <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/687/index.html">515 U. S. 687</a>, 703.  Deference is not due if Congress has made its intent \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory text, <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842, but \xe2\x80\x9cif the statute is silent or ambiguous \xe2\x80\xa6 the question \xe2\x80\xa6 is whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 843.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x94or ambiguity\xe2\x80\x94of certain words or phrases may only become evident \xe2\x80\xa6 in context,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 132, \xc2\xa77(a)(2) must be read against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal were it construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  Such a reading leaves a fundamental ambiguity.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates of ESA \xc2\xa77(a)(2) and CWA \xc2\xa7402(b), and consequently the statutory language\xe2\x80\x94read in light of the canon against implied repeals\xe2\x80\x94does not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.  Thus, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agency\xe2\x80\x99s expert interpretation, which harmonizes the statutes by applying \xc2\xa77(a)(2) to guide agencies\xe2\x80\x99 existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.  This interpretation is reasonable in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and the overall statutory scheme and is therefore entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.  The regulation\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that such action will not jeopardize listed species.  The basic principle of <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/752/index.html">541 U. S. 752</a>\xe2\x80\x94that an agency cannot be considered the legal \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to take, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 770\xe2\x80\x94supports the reasonableness of the FWS\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.

While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has shown that it can carry out \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of listed species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species, Arizona has satisfied each of those criteria.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument has also been disclaimed by the FWS and the NMFS, the agencies primarily charged with administering \xc2\xa77(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section.

Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency \xe2\x80\xa6 is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question presented is whether \xc2\xa77(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authorities\xe2\x80\x94who will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statutes\xe2\x80\x94was proper.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p>\n\n1</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA), 86 Stat. 816, 33 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93340, p. 564.  However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em> </em>authorities,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565\xe2\x80\x93566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EPA disagreed, maintaining that \xe2\x80\x9cits approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x94which directs that the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cshall approve\xe2\x80\x9d a transfer request if that section\xe2\x80\x99s nine statutory criteria are met\xe2\x80\x94stripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654\xe2\x80\x93655.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9closs of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve the State of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the State\xe2\x80\x99s program meets the requirements of [\xc2\xa7]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the FWS opined that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s continuing oversight of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101\xe2\x80\x93107.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in \xc2\xa7402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWS\xe2\x80\x99s biological opinion had \xe2\x80\x9cconclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS\xe2\x80\x99] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(D), which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F.\xc2\xa03d 946 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA \xe2\x80\x9crelied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 977, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe two propositions that underlie the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x94that (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decision\xe2\x80\x94cannot both be true,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to \xe2\x80\x9cremand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA provided an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in \xc2\xa7402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the transfer application was not subject to \xc2\xa77(a)(2) because it was not a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary action\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03 (interpreting \xc2\xa77(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions \xe2\x80\x9cin which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control\xe2\x80\x9d).  420 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 967\xe2\x80\x93969.  It viewed the FWS\xe2\x80\x99s regulation as merely \xe2\x80\x9ccoterminous\xe2\x80\x9d with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98authorized, funded, or carried out\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(a)(2)).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s transfer decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary action\xe2\x80\x9d under 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03 because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a state\xe2\x80\x99s proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe EPA administrator \xe2\x80\x98shall approve\xe2\x80\x99 the program.  33 U.

He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396\xe2\x80\x93398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397\xe2\x80\x93399.  He rejected the panel majority\xe2\x80\x99s broad construction of ESA \xc2\xa77(a)(2), concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F.\xc2\xa03d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 27, 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 298\xe2\x80\x93299 (CA5 1998).

See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/183/index.html">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to \xe2\x80\x9cremand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision unless it</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9chas relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agency\xe2\x80\x99s <em>final</em> action, see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWS\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of its biological opinion had \xe2\x80\x9cconclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s previously expressed position\xe2\x80\x94and their position throughout this litigation\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under \xc2\xa7402 of the CWA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 admonition that in reviewing agency action, \xe2\x80\x9cdue account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.

The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) raises that floor and alters \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory command.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) would not only abrogate \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany action authorized, funded, or carried out by\xe2\x80\x9d a federal agency\xe2\x80\x94covering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.

Pursuant to this regulation, \xc2\xa77(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/687/index.html">515 U.

When \xc2\xa77(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA and \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory language\xe2\x80\x94read in light of the canon against implied repeals\xe2\x80\x94does not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agency\xe2\x80\x99s expert interpretation, which cabins \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s application to \xe2\x80\x9cactions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03.

Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d something\xe2\x80\x94as the court below recognized\xe2\x80\x94means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  420 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulation\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/752/index.html">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004).  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because \xe2\x80\x9cthe legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant \xe2\x80\x98cause\xe2\x80\x99 of the effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 770.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; \xc2\xa77(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>\xe2\x80\x94that an agency cannot be considered the legal \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to take\xe2\x80\x94supports the reasonableness of the FWS\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.  See also <em>California</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/index.html">438 U. S. 645</a>, 668, n. 21 (1978) (holding that a statutory requirement that federal operating agencies conform to state water usage rules applied only to the extent that it was not \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with other congressional directives\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court below simply disregarded \xc2\xa7402.03\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s reach, dismissing \xe2\x80\x9cthe regulation\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x98discretionary \xe2\x80\xa6 involvement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as merely \xe2\x80\x9ccongruent with the statutory reference to actions \xe2\x80\x98authorized, funded, or carried out\xe2\x80\x99 by the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 F.\xc2\xa03d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/index.html">401 U. S. 402</a>, 415\xe2\x80\x93416 (1971); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (\xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe power or right to decide or act according to one\xe2\x80\x99s own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the mandatory language of \xc2\xa7402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agency\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of \xc2\xa77(a)(2), but not confining the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either \xc2\xa77(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see \xc2\xa7402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  On the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading, \xc2\xa7402.03\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 31 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.  As the dissent itself points out, the proposed version of \xc2\xa7402.03 initially stated that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 7 and the requirements of this Part apply to <em>all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 48 Fed. Reg. 29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to \xe2\x80\x9call actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control,\xe2\x80\x9d 51 Fed. Reg. 19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading would  rob the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, we read \xc2\xa7402.03 to mean what it says: that \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/index.html">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978), supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Dam\xe2\x80\x94despite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed project\xe2\x80\x94because doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa77 of the ESA contained \xe2\x80\x9cno exemptions\xe2\x80\x9d and reflected \xe2\x80\x9ca conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the \xe2\x80\x98primary missions\xe2\x80\x99 of federal agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed \xc2\xa77\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189\xe2\x80\x93193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated\xe2\x80\x9d and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in \xc2\xa7402.03, that the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency action\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether \xc2\xa77(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03 addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if \xc2\xa77(a)(2) is read to apply only to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa7402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the \xc2\xa7402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering \xc2\xa77(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by \xc2\xa7402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93549, at 103a\xe2\x80\x93116a.

Since the transfer of NPDES permitting authority is not discretionary, but rather is mandated once a State has met the criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA, it follows that a transfer of NPDES permitting authority does not trigger \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s consultation and no-jeopardy requirements.

After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that \xc2\xa77 of the ESA</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9creveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.

A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish \xe2\x80\x9cwould require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million,\xe2\x80\x9d we found \xe2\x80\x9cthat the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.

We explained that earlier endangered species legislation \xe2\x80\x9cqualified the obligation of federal agencies,\xe2\x80\x9d but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted \xe2\x80\x9call phrases which might have qualified an agency\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.

It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to \xe2\x80\x9call federal agencies\xe2\x80\x9d and to all \xe2\x80\x9cactions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those \xe2\x80\x9cactions\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccarried out\xe2\x80\x9d by a federal agency.  See 16 U.

Therefore, assuming that \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution is to rely on 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.03, which states that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court explains that this regulation \xe2\x80\x9charmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to \xc2\xa77(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of \xc2\xa7402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of \xc2\xa77 in the \xe2\x80\x9csnail darter\xe2\x80\x9d case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the plain language of \xc2\xa7402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of \xc2\xa77 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read \xc2\xa7402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that \xc2\xa77 \xe2\x80\x9cadmits of no exception[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 437 U.

That is not, in fact, what \xc2\xa7402.03 \xe2\x80\x9csays.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s addition to the text, not the agency\xe2\x80\x99s.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of \xc2\xa77\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of \xc2\xa7402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of \xc2\xa7402.03 stated that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa77 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 Fed. Reg. 29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cFederal involvement or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  51 Fed. Reg. 19958 (1986).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 1001 (2005) (holding that an agency is free within \xe2\x80\x9cthe limits of reasoned interpretation to change course\xe2\x80\x9d only if it \xe2\x80\x9cadequately justifies the change\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of \xc2\xa77 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only explanation the agency provided for \xc2\xa7402.03 was the following:</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9cThis section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of \xe2\x80\x98action\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x98action\xe2\x80\x99 is provided in the discussion under \xc2\xa7402.01 above.\xe2\x80\x9d  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis statement directs us to two sources: the definition of \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7402.02 and the \xe2\x80\x9cexplanation for the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x98action\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b)\xe2\x80\x82the promulgation of regulations . . . \xe2\x80\x9d  (second and third emphases added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nActions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d expressly refers to \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d agency activities or programs \xe2\x80\x9cof any kind,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d as a limitation on \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court creates a contradiction in the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s own regulation.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the final rule\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x99action\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of \xc2\xa7402.03.  That explanation plainly states that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> Federal actions including \xe2\x80\x98conservations programs\xe2\x80\x99 are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they \xe2\x80\x98may affect\xe2\x80\x99 listed species or their critical habitats.\xe2\x80\x9d  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d is therefore a strong indication that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary\xe2\x80\x9d is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em> </em>it.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on \xc2\xa7402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984), because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F.\xc2\xa02d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703\xe2\x80\x93704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s biological opinion \xe2\x80\x9cdid not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. in No.\xc2\xa006\xe2\x80\x93549, p.\xc2\xa024; see App. 77\xe2\x80\x93124 (never mentioning \xc2\xa7402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently \xe2\x80\x9cclarified\xe2\x80\x9d its position regarding \xc2\xa7402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93549, pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9325; <em>id</em>., at 26 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s pending transfer application reflect those agencies\xe2\x80\x99 considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03\xe2\x80\x9d); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93340, pp. 103a\xe2\x80\x93116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n.\xc2\xa05.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/80/index.html">318 U. S. 80</a>, 87 (1943).  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) and \xc2\xa7402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, \xc2\xa7402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9cEach Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an \xe2\x80\x98agency action\xe2\x80\x99) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa77(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual error\xe2\x80\x94an error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to \xc2\xa77(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether \xc2\xa77(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned. \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA \xe2\x80\x9c<em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 404 n.\xc2\xa02 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies \xe2\x80\x9cconsul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will \xe2\x80\x9caffect\xe2\x80\x9d those species.  See 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(c).  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a \xe2\x80\x9cbiological opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cdetail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71536(b)(3)(A); see also 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.14(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 63 Fed. Reg. 51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a \xe2\x80\x9cno jeopardy\xe2\x80\x9d finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(b)(3)(A); see also 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.14(h)(3).  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulations define \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable and prudent alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d as</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9calternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. \xe2\x80\x9d  50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.02.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with [its] intended purpose\xe2\x80\x9d and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegal authority,\xe2\x80\x9d while also avoiding any violation of  \xc2\xa77(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and prudent alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take place\xe2\x80\x94as required by \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA\xe2\x80\x94but in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, for the rare case in which no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and prudent alternative\xe2\x80\x9d can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the \xe2\x80\x9cEndangered Species Committee,\xe2\x80\x9d which it authorized to grant exemptions from \xc2\xa77(a)(2).  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(e).  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the \xe2\x80\x9cGod Squad\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGod Committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committee\xe2\x80\x99s membership,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] procedures,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and the factors it must consider in deciding whether to grant an exemption.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committee\xe2\x80\x94not to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the State\xe2\x80\x99s permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/91/index.html">503 U. S. 91</a>, 105 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs\xe2\x80\x9d).  If a state permit is \xe2\x80\x9coutside the guidelines and the requirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(d)(2); 66 Fed. Reg. 11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s oversight duties.  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa7123.24(a) (2006).</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7123.24(b)(2); \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7123.24(b)(3); and \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA \xe2\x80\x9cmay include other terms, conditions, or agreements\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9crelevant to the administration and enforcement of the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory program.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the \xc2\xa77(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to \xc2\xa77 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can use\xe2\x80\x94and in fact has used\xe2\x80\x94the MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards\xe2\x80\x9d).  Alternatively, \xe2\x80\x9cEPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to \xe2\x80\x9cobject to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality\xe2\x80\x9d).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting \xc2\xa77(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority to transfer permitting authority under \xc2\xa7402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EPA Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to \xc2\xa7402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s words, that category includes actions \xe2\x80\x9cthat an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The \xe2\x80\x9ctriggering event\xe2\x80\x9d for EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed program.  See 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(b).  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator \xe2\x80\x9cshall approve\xe2\x80\x9d the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not \xe2\x80\x9ctriggering events\xe2\x80\x9d; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, \xc2\xa7402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of \xe2\x80\x9cshall.\xe2\x80\x9d  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquist\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion in the \xe2\x80\x9csnail darter\xe2\x80\x9d case explains, a federal statute using the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211\xe2\x80\x93212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPA\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(b)(1)(A).  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise \xe2\x80\x9csome judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out \xc2\xa7402(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated statutory criteria.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own logic.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7402.03, \xc2\xa77(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identified\xe2\x80\x94as it has here\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa77(a)(2) must apply.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The MOA regulation described in Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under \xc2\xa7123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 63 Fed. Reg. 51165 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 298\xe2\x80\x93299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 40 CFR \xc2\xa7123.24 gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 96\xe2\x80\x9360874 (CA5).  Arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Again, because EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significant\xe2\x80\x94indeed, abounding\xe2\x80\x94discretion, I would find that \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own flawed theory of these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the \xe2\x80\x9csnail darter\xe2\x80\x9d case with a reminder that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U.

First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, <em>ibid.</em>, because <em>Public Citizen</em> dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by \xc2\xa77(a)(2) of the ESA, see <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/158/index.html">437 U. S. 158</a>, 188, n. 34 (1978) (holding that NEPA cases are \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely inapposite\xe2\x80\x9d to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic principle\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Public Citizen</em> is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  <em>Ante,</em> at 20.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Our decision in <em>Public Citizen</em> turned on what we called \xe2\x80\x9ca critical feature of the case\xe2\x80\x9d: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had \xe2\x80\x9cno ability to countermand\xe2\x80\x9d the President\xe2\x80\x99s lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  <em>Ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise <em>its own</em> judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has <em>its own</em> authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 50 CFR \xc2\xa7402.02 (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly <em>or indirectly</em> caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0EPA also discussed several other regulations that give it discretion.  For example, under 40 CFR \xc2\xa7123.61(b), EPA is required to solicit public comments on a State\xe2\x80\x99s transfer application, and it must \xe2\x80\x9capprove or disapprove the program\xe2\x80\x9d after \xe2\x80\x9ctaking into consideration all comments received.\xe2\x80\x9d  As EPA explained in its Fifth Circuit brief, if it \xe2\x80\x9cwere simply acting in a ministerial fashion, such weighing of the merits of public comments would be unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for EPA in No. 96\xe2\x80\x9360874 (CA5).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1" i="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1" i="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962462">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nNATIONAL ASSN.

S. C. \xc2\xa71536(a)(2), really covers every possible agency action even of totally unrelated agencies\xe2\x80\x94such as, say, a discretionary determination by the Internal Revenue Service whether to prosecute or settle a particular tax liability, see 26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa77121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time I add one additional consideration in support of his (and my own) dissenting views.  The Court emphasizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y its terms, the statutory language [of \xc2\xa7402(b) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71342(b)] is mandatory and <em>the list exclusive</em>; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  My own understanding of agency action leads me to believe that the majority cannot possibly be correct in concluding that the structure of \xc2\xa7402(b) precludes application of \xc2\xa77(a)(2) to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary action.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9321 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  That is because grants of discretionary authority always come with <em>some </em>implicit limits attached.  See L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 359 (1965) (discretion is \xe2\x80\x9ca power to make a choice\xe2\x80\x9d from a \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible class of actions\xe2\x80\x9d).  And there are likely numerous instances in which, prior to, but not after, the enactment of \xc2\xa77(a)(2), the statute might have implicitly placed \xe2\x80\x9cspecies preservation\xe2\x80\x9d outside those limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To take one example, consider the statute that once granted the old Federal Power Commission (FPC) the authority to grant a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of public convenience and necessity\xe2\x80\x9d to permit a natural gas company to operate a new pipeline.  See 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7717f(c)(1)(A).  It says that \xe2\x80\x9ca certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor . . . if it is found that the applicant is able and willing properly to do the acts and to perform the service proposed . . . and that the proposed service . . . is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7717f(e)<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before enactment of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 884, it is at least uncertain whether the FPC could have withheld a certificate simply because  a natural gas pipeline might threaten an endangered animal, for given the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language and history, species preservation does not naturally fall within its terms.  But we have held that the Endangered Species Act changed the regulatory landscape, \xe2\x80\x9cindicat[ing] beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the <em>highest</em> of priorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/index.html">437 U. S. 153</a>, 174 (1978) (emphasis added).  Indeed, the Endangered Species Act demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9ca conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the \xe2\x80\x98primary missions\xe2\x80\x99 of federal agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 185.  And given a new pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s potential effect upon habitat and landscape, it seems reasonable to believe, once Congress enacted the new law, the FPC\xe2\x80\x99s successor (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) would act within its authority in taking species-endangering effects into account.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To take another example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has, by statute, an \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d list of criteria to consider in reviewing applications for approval of a new drug.  See 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7355(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Secretary finds . . . [<em>e.g.</em>,] the investigations . . . do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe . . . he shall issue an order refusing to approve the application\xe2\x80\x9d).  Preservation of endangered species is not on this \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d list of criteria.  Yet I imagine that the FDA <em>now </em>should take account, when it grants or denies drug approval, of the effect of manufacture and marketing of a new drug upon the preservation or destruction of an endangered species.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only meaningful difference between the provision now before us, \xc2\xa7402(b) of the Clean Water Act, and the energy- and drug-related statutes that I have mentioned is that the very purpose of the former is to preserve the state of our natural environment\xe2\x80\x94a purpose that the Endangered Species Act shares.  That shared purpose shows that \xc2\xa77(a)(2) must apply to the Clean Water Act <em>a fortiori</em>.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
