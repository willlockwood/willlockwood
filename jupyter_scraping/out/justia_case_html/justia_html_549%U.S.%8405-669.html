S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72415(a), which provides in relevant part: \xe2\x80\x9c[E]very <em>action for money damages</em> brought by the United States or an \xe2\x80\xa6 agency thereof which is founded upon any contract \xe2\x80\xa6 , shall be barred unless <em>the complaint</em> is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the appeals, ruling that \xc2\xa72415(a) did not govern the administrative order.  The District Court agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section 2415(a)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year statute of limitations applies only to court actions, not to the administrative payment orders involved in this case.

See, <em>e.g., Unexcelled Chem. Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/59/index.html">345 U. S. 59</a>, 66.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction for money damages\xe2\x80\x9d reinforces this reading because the term \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d is generally used to mean pecuniary compensation or indemnity recovered in court.  Moreover, the fact that \xc2\xa72415(a) distinguishes between judicial and administrative proceedings by providing that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d must commence \xe2\x80\x9cwithin one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d shows that Congress knew how to identify administrative proceedings and manifestly had two separate concepts in mind when it enacted \xc2\xa72415(a).

The numerous statutes and regulations cited to document this supposed usage actually undermine petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, since none of them uses the term \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone to refer to administrative proceedings.

Their examples of statutes and regulations employing the term \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in the administrative context are unavailing, since such occasional usage of the term does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of a civil action.  Moreover, an MMS payment order lacks the essential attributes of a complaint, which is a filing that commences a proceeding that may result in a legally binding order providing relief.  In contrast, an MMS order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation on the party to which it is issued.  Given that the failure to comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day, see 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71719(c), the order plays an entirely different role from that of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Any remaining doubts are erased by the canon that statutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the government.  This canon is rooted in the traditional rule that time does not run against the King.  A corollary of this rule is that a sovereign that elects to subject itself to a statute of limitations is given the benefit of the doubt if the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope is ambiguous.  <em>Bowers</em> v. <em>New York &amp; Albany Lighterage Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/273/346/index.html">273 U. S. 346</a>, distinguished.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0The Court disagrees with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions renders \xc2\xa72415(i)\xe2\x80\x94which specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 from collecting any claim \xe2\x80\xa6 by means of administrative offset\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94superfluous in contravention of the canon against reading a statute in a way that makes part of it redundant.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, \xc2\xa72415(i) is not mere surplusage, but clarifies that administrative offsets are not covered by \xc2\xa72415(a) even if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.  To accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, on the other hand, the Court would have to hold either that \xc2\xa72415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative actions when \xc2\xa72415(i) was added in 1982.  The clear meaning of \xc2\xa72415(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, which has not been amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter would require the unrealistic conclusion that in 1982 Congress proceeded to enlarge \xc2\xa72415 to cover administrative proceedings by the oblique and cryptic route of inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(f)\xc2\xa0Although interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions may result in certain peculiarities, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alternative interpretation would itself result in disharmony.  For instance, MMS oil and gas lease payment orders are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land.  30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71724(b)(1).  Given the exhortation that the Interior Secretary \xe2\x80\x9caggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a shorter, 6-year statute of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands.  Finally, while cogent, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 policy arguments as to why limiting \xc2\xa72415(a) to judicial actions frustrates the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes must be viewed in perspective.  For example, because there are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign special treatment, the relevant inquiry in a case like this is simply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question.  Prior to \xc2\xa72415(a)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Government contract actions were not subject to any statute of limitations.  See <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/126/index.html">304 U. S. 126</a>, 132.  Absent congressional action changing this rule, it remains the law, and \xc2\xa72415(a) betrays no intent to change the rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72415(a), which sets out a 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions.  We hold that this provision does not apply to these administrative payment orders, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease public-domain lands to private parties for the production of oil and gas.  41 Stat. 437, as amended, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7181 <em>et seq</em>.  MLA lessees are obligated to pay a royalty of at least \xe2\x80\x9c12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7226(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1982, Congress enacted the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (FOGRMA), 96 Stat. 2447, as amended, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701 <em>et seq</em>., to address the concern that the \xe2\x80\x9csystem of accounting with respect to royalties and other payments due and owing on oil and gas produced from such lease sites [was] archaic and inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71701(a)(2).  FOGRMA ordered the Secretary of the Interior to \xe2\x80\x9caudit and reconcile, to the extent practicable, all current and past lease accounts for leases of oil or gas and take appropriate actions to make additional collections or refunds as warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71711(c)(1).  The Secretary, in turn, has assigned these duties to the MMS.  30 CFR \xc2\xa7201.100 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under FOGRMA, lessees are responsible in the first instance for the accurate calculation and payment of royalties.  30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71712(a).  MMS, in turn, is authorized to audit those payments to determine whether a royalty has been overpaid or underpaid.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71711(a) and (c); 30 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7206.150(c), 206.170(d).  In the event that an audit suggests an underpayment, it is MMS\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] practice to send the lessee a letter inquiring about the perceived deficiency.  If, after reviewing the lessee\xe2\x80\x99s response, MMS concludes that the lessee owes additional royalties, MMS issues an order requiring payment of the amount due.  Failure to comply with such an order carries a stiff penalty: \xe2\x80\x9cAny person who\xe2\x80\x94(1) knowingly or willfully fails to make any royalty payment by the date as specified by [an] order \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be liable for a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation for each day such violation continues.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71719(c).  The Attorney General may enforce these orders in federal court.  \xc2\xa71722(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An MMS payment order may be appealed, first to the Director of MMS and then to the Interior Board of Land Appeals or to an Assistant Secretary.  30 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7290.105, 290.108.  While filing an appeal does not generally stay the payment order, \xc2\xa7218.50(c), MMS will usually suspend the order\xe2\x80\x99s effect after the lessee complies with applicable bonding or financial solvency requirements, \xc2\xa7243.8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress supplemented this scheme by enacting the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996 (FOGRSFA), 110 Stat. 1700, as amended, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701 <em>et seq.</em>  FOGRSFA adopted a prospective 7-year statute of limitations for any \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceeding or demand\xe2\x80\x9d for royalties arising under a federal oil or gas lease.  \xc2\xa71724(b)(1).  The parties agree that this provision applies both to judicial actions (\xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceeding[s]\xe2\x80\x9d) and to MMS\xe2\x80\x99 administrative payment orders (\xe2\x80\x9cdemand[s]\xe2\x80\x9d) arising on or after September 1, 1996.  <em>Ibid.  </em>This provision does not, however, apply to judicial proceedings or demands arising from leases of Indian land or underpayments of royalties on pre-September 1, 1996, production.  FOGRSFA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79, 11, 110 Stat. 1717, notes following 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that a lawsuit in court to recover royalties owed to the Government on pre-September 1, 1996, production is covered by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72415(a), which sets out a general 6-year statute of limitations for Government contract actions.  That section, which was enacted in 1966, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSubject to the provisions of section 2416 of this title, and except as otherwise provided by Congress, every <em>action for money damages</em> brought by the United States or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact, shall be barred unless <em>the complaint</em> is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings required by contract or by law, whichever is later.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhether this general 6-year statute of limitations also governs MMS administrative payment orders concerning pre-September 1, 1996, production is the question that we must decide in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner BP America Production Co. holds gas leases from the Federal Government for lands in New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s San Juan Basin.  BP\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Amoco Production Co., first entered into these leases nearly 50 years ago, and these leases require the payment of the minimum 12.5 percent royalty prescribed by 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7226(b)(1)(A).  For years, Amoco calculated the royalty as a percentage of the value of the gas as of the moment it was produced at the well.  In 1996, MMS sent lessees a letter directing that royalties should be calculated based not on the value of the gas at the well, but on the value of the gas after it was treated to meet the quality requirements for introduction into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s mainline pipelines.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Consistent with this guidance, MMS in 1997 ordered Amoco to pay additional royalties for the period from January 1989 through December 1996 in order to cover the difference between the value of the treated gas and its lesser value at the well.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Amoco appealed the order, disputing MMS\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of its royalty obligations and arguing that the payment order was in any event barred in part by the 6-year statute of limitations in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72415(a).  The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the appeal and ruled that the statute of limitations was inapplicable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Amoco, together with petitioner Atlantic Richfield Co., sought review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which agreed with the Assistant Secretary that \xc2\xa72415(a) did not govern the administrative order.  <em>Amoco Production Co.</em> v.<em> Baca</em>, 300 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1, 21 (2003).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, <em>Amoco Production Co</em>. v. <em>Watson</em>, 410 F.\xc2\xa03d 722, 733 (2005), and we granted certiorari, 547 U.

In 1966, when \xc2\xa72415(a) was enacted, a commonly used legal dictionary defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cright of action\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right to bring suit; a legal right to maintain an action,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9csuit\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cany proceeding \xe2\x80\xa6 in a court of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1488, 1603 (4th ed. 1951) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s).  Likewise, \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d was defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe first or initiatory pleading on the part of the plaintiff in a civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 356.

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction for money damages\xe2\x80\x9d reinforces this reading because the term \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d is generally used to mean \xe2\x80\x9cpecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may be recovered <em>in the courts.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 466 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa72415(a) suggests that Congress intended these terms to apply more broadly to administrative proceedings.

But the broad terms \xe2\x80\x9cevery\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d do not assist petitioners, as they do not broaden the ordinary meaning of the key term \xe2\x80\x9caction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that their interpretation is supported by <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/546/index.html">478 U.

In <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council</em>, we construed the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee provision of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which authorizes a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, [to] award costs of litigation \xe2\x80\xa6 to any party.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77604(d).  We permitted the recovery of fees both for work done in court and in subsequent administrative proceedings.  But the pertinent statutory provision in that case did not employ the key terms that appear in the statute at issue here.  Specifically, the CWA provision referred to \xe2\x80\x9clitigation,\xe2\x80\x9d not to an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d commenced by the filing of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, <em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em>the work done by counsel [in the administrative phase of the case] was as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief \xe2\x80\xa6 as was all of their earlier work in the courtroom \xe2\x80\xa6 obtaining the consent decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U.

There, we considered whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) could order a federal agency to pay compensatory damages in an administrative proceeding.  Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(b), authorized the EEOC to employ \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not specifically authorize damages, and \xc2\xa7717(c) authorized a subsequent court action against an employer agency, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c).  In 1991, Congress added Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71977A(a)(1), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981a(a)(1), which provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 \xe2\x80\xa6 the complaining party may recover compensatory \xe2\x80\xa6 damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>West</em>, the defendant agency argued that the enactment of \xc2\xa71981a(a)(1) showed that Congress did not consider compensatory damages to be \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedies\xe2\x80\x9d in an EEOC proceeding, as opposed to an action brought by an aggrieved employee.  If Congress had wished to authorize the award of compensatory damages in an EEOC proceeding, the defendant agency reasoned, Congress would have so provided in \xc2\xa71981a(a)(l), by expressly cross-referencing \xc2\xa7717(c).  We rejected this argument, but in doing so we did not hold that an EEOC proceeding is an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71981a(a)(1).  Rather, we simply concluded that the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s authorization under \xc2\xa7717(b) to award \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedies\xe2\x80\x9d was broad enough to encompass compensatory damages.  527 U. S., at 220\xe2\x80\x93221.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we are not persuaded by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the term \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72415(a) applies to the administrative proceedings that follow the issuance of an MMS payment order.</p>\n<p align="left">C </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We similarly reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion that an MMS letter or payment order constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72415(a).  Petitioners point to examples of statutes and regulations that employ the term \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in the administrative context.  See<em>, e.g.,</em> 15 U.

But the occasional use of the term to describe certain administrative filings does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 356.  Moreover, even if the distinction between administrative and judicial proceedings is put aside, an MMS payment order lacks the essential attributes of a complaint.  While a complaint is a filing that commences a proceeding that may in the end result in a legally binding order providing relief, an MMS payment order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation on the party to which it is issued.  As noted, the failure to comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day.  An MMS payment order, therefore, plays an entirely different role from that of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that any doubts remain regarding the meaning of \xc2\xa72415(a), they are erased by the rule that statutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the government.  <em>E.

The provision in that case, however, provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]o suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d shall commence more than five years after the filing of the return.<em>  Id.,</em> at 348\xe2\x80\x93349.

But the Court concluded that the canon had no application in that case because the text of the relevant statute, unlike \xc2\xa72415(a), applied clearly and separately to \xe2\x80\x9csuits\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court saw no reason to give these different terms the same meaning.  <em>Id.,</em> at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We come now to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would render subsection (i) of the same statute superfluous.  Subsection (i) provides as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by means of administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716 of title 31.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73701(a)(1).  Thus, under subsection (i), the Government may recover a debt via an administrative offset even if the Government would be time barred under subsection (a) from pursuing the debt in court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that, if \xc2\xa72415(a) applies only to judicial proceedings and not to administrative proceedings, there is no need for \xc2\xa72415(i)\xe2\x80\x99s rule protecting a particular administrative mechanism (<em>i.e.</em>, an administrative offset) from the statute of limitations set out in subsection (a).  Invoking the canon against reading a statute in a way that makes part of the statute redundant, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 31 (2001), petitioners contend that subsection (i) shows that subsection (a) was meant to apply to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals noted, subsection (i) was not enacted at the same time as subsection (a) but rather was added 16 years later by the Debt Collection Act of 1982.  96 Stat. 1749.  This enactment followed a dispute between the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) over whether an administrative offset could be used to recoup a debt where a judicial recoupment action was already time barred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1978, in response to a question from the United States Civil Service Commission, OLC opined that an administrative offset could not be used to recoup a debt as to which a judicial action was already time barred.  OLC reached this conclusion not because it believed that \xc2\xa72415(a) reached administrative proceedings generally,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but rather because of the particular purpose of an administrative offset.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere [a] debt has not been reduced to judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d OLC stated, \xe2\x80\x9can administrative offset is merely a pre-judgment attachment device.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum from John M.

OLC opined that a prejudgment attachment device such as this exists only to preserve funds to satisfy any judgment the creditor subsequently obtains.  <em>Id.,</em> at 4 (citing cases).  OLC therefore concluded that, where a lawsuit is already foreclosed by \xc2\xa72415(a), an administrative offset that is the functional equivalent of a pretrial attachment is also unavailable.  <em>Id.,</em> at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The OCC disagreed.

In its view, the question was answered by</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he general rule \xe2\x80\xa6 that statutes of limitations applicable to suits for debts or money demands bar or run only against the remedy (the right to bring suit) to which they apply and do not discharge the debt or extinguish, or even impair, the right or obligation, either in law or in fact, and the creditor may avail himself of every other lawful means of realizing on the debt or obligation.  See<em> Mascot Oil Co. </em>v.<em> United States</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa02d 309 (Ct. Cl. 1930), affirmed <a href="/cases/federal/us/282/434/index.html">282 U. S. 434</a>; and 33 Comp. Gen. 66 (1953).

It clarifies that administrative offsets are not covered by subsection (a) even if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, on the other hand, we would have to hold either that \xc2\xa72415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative actions when subsection (i) was added in 1982.  The clear meaning of the text of \xc2\xa72415(a), which has not been amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter would require us to conclude that in 1982 Congress elected to enlarge \xc2\xa72415 to cover administrative proceedings by inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that Congress would proceed by such an oblique and cryptic route.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend that interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions results in a statutory scheme with peculiarities that Congress could not have intended.  For example, petitioners note that while they are required by statute to preserve their records regarding royalty obligations for only seven years, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71724(f), the interpretation of \xc2\xa72415(a) adopted by the Court of Appeals permits MMS to issue payment orders that reach back much farther.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are mindful of the fact that a statute should be read where possible as effecting a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 133 (2000), but here petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alternative interpretation of \xc2\xa72415(a) would itself result in disharmony.  For instance, under FOGRSFA, MMS payment orders regarding oil and gas leases are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land.  Consequently, if we agreed with petitioners that \xc2\xa72415(a) applies generally to administrative proceedings, payment orders relating to oil and gas royalties owed under leases of Indian land would be subject to a shorter (<em>i.e., </em>6-year) statute of limitations than similar payment orders relating to leases of other public-domain lands (which would be governed by FOGRSFA\xe2\x80\x99s new 7-year statute).  Particularly in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 exhortation that the Secretary of the Interior \xe2\x80\x9caggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas,\xe2\x80\x9d 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a shorter statute of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend, finally, that interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as applying only to judicial actions would frustrate the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes of providing repose, ensuring that actions are brought while evidence is fresh, lightening recordkeeping burdens, and pressuring federal agencies to assert federal rights promptly.  These are certainly cogent policy arguments, but they must be viewed in perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, petitioners overstate the scope of the problem, since Congress of course can enact and has enacted specific statutes of limitations to govern specific administrative actions.  See, <em>e.g., </em>42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75205(a)(1) (statute of limitations for an administrative action to recover payments made to state governments for disaster or emergency assistance).  Indeed, in 1996, FOGRSFA imposed just such a limitation prospectively on all non-Indian land, oil, and gas lease claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and more fundamentally, the consequences of interpreting \xc2\xa72415(a) as limited to court actions must be considered in light of the traditional rule exempting proceedings brought by the sovereign from any time bar.  There are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign this special treatment, and therefore in a case like this, where the issue is how far Congress meant to go when it enacted a statute of limitations applicable to the Government, arguing that an expansive interpretation would serve the general purposes of statutes of limitations is somewhat beside the point.  The relevant inquiry, instead, is simply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question.  Here prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa72415(a) in 1966, contract actions brought by the Government were not subject to any statute of limitations.  See <em>Guaranty Trust Co.,</em> 304 U. S., at 132.  Absent congressional action changing this rule, it remains the law, and the text of \xc2\xa72415(a) betrays no intent to change this rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the final analysis, while we appreciate petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, they are insufficient to overcome the plain meaning of the statutory text.  We therefore hold that the 6-year statute of limitations in \xc2\xa72415(a) applies only to court actions and not to the administrative proceedings involved in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice and Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0MMS is not always the auditing body, as MMS may delegate its authority to the host State or an Indian tribe.  30 U.
