Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), without more, "taints" subsequent admissions made after a suspect has been fully advised of and has waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Respondent, Michael James Elstad, was convicted of burglary by an Oregon trial court.  The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent\'s signed confession, although voluntary, was rendered inadmissible by a prior remark made in response to questioning without benefit of <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  We granted certiorari, 465 U.S. 1078 (1984), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In December, 1981, the home of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Gross, in the town of Salem, Polk County, Ore., was burglarized.  Missing were art objects and furnishings valued at $150,000.  A witness to the burglary contacted the Polk County Sheriff\'s Office, implicating respondent Michael Elstad, an 18-year-old neighbor and friend of the Grosses\' teenage son.  Thereupon, Officers Burke and McAllister went to the home of respondent Elstad, with a warrant for his arrest.  Elstad\'s mother answered the door.  She led the officers to her son\'s room, where he lay on his bed, clad in shorts and listening to his stereo.  The officers asked him to get dressed and to accompany them into the living room.  Officer McAllister asked respondent\'s mother to step into the kitchen, where he explained that they had a warrant for her </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 470 U. S. 301</a></p><p> son\'s arrest for the burglary of a neighbor\'s residence.  Officer Burke remained with Elstad in the living room.  He later testified:</p>\n<p>"I sat down with Mr. Elstad and I asked him if he was aware of why Detective McAllister and myself were there to talk with him.  He stated no, he had no idea why we were there.  I then asked him if he knew a person by the name of Gross, and he said yes, he did, and also added that he heard that there was a robbery at the Gross house.  And at that point, I told Mr. Elstad that I felt he was involved in that, and he looked at me and stated, \'Yes, I was there.\'"</p>\n<p>App.19-20.  The officers then escorted Elstad to the back of the patrol car.  As they were about to leave for the Polk County Sheriff\'s office, Elstad\'s father arrived home and came to the rear of the patrol car.  The officers advised him that his son was a suspect in the burglary.  Officer Burke testified that Mr. Elstad became quite agitated, opened the rear door of the car and admonished his son:  "I told you that you were going to get into trouble.  You wouldn\'t listen to me.  You never learn."  <em>Id.</em> at 21.</p>\n<p>Elstad was transported to the Sheriff\'s headquarters and, approximately one hour later, Officers Burke and McAllister joined him in McAllister\'s office.  McAllister then advised respondent for the first time of his <em>Miranda</em> rights, reading from a standard card.  Respondent indicated he understood his rights, and, having these rights in mind, wished to speak with the officers.  Elstad gave a full statement, explaining that he had known that the Gross family was out of town, and had been paid to lead several acquaintances to the Gross residence and show them how to gain entry through a defective sliding glass door.  The statement was typed, reviewed by respondent, read back to him for correction, initialed and signed by Elstad and both officers.  As an afterthought, Elstad added and initialed the sentence, "After leaving the house, Robby &amp; I went back to [the] van &amp; Robby handed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 470 U. S. 302</a></p><p> me a small bag of grass."  App. 42. Respondent concedes that the officers made no threats or promises either at his residence or at the Sheriff\'s office.</p>\n<p>Respondent was charged with first-degree burglary.  He was represented at trial by retained counsel.  Elstad waived his right to a jury, and his case was tried by a Circuit Court Judge.  Respondent moved at once to suppress his oral statement and signed confession.  He contended that the statement he made in response to questioning at his house "let the cat out of the bag," citing <em>United States v. Bayer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html">331 U. S. 532</a></span> (1947), and tainted the subsequent confession as "fruit of the poisonous tree," citing <em>Wong Sun v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/case.html">371 U. S. 471</a></span> (1963).  The judge ruled that the statement, "I was there," had to be excluded because the defendant had not been advised of his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  The written confession taken after Elstad\'s arrival at the Sheriff\'s office, however, was admitted in evidence.  The court found:</p>\n<p>"[H]is written statement was given freely, voluntarily and knowingly by the defendant after he had waived his right to remain silent and have counsel present, which waiver was evidenced by the card which the defendant had signed.  [It] was not tainted in any way by the previous brief statement between the defendant and the Sheriff\'s Deputies that had arrested him."</p>\n<p>App. 45.  Elstad was found guilty of burglary in the first degree.  He received a 5-year sentence, and was ordered to pay $18,000 in restitution.</p>\n<p>Following his conviction, respondent appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Wong Sun</em> and <em>Bayer.</em>  The State conceded that Elstad had been in custody when he made his statement, "I was there," and accordingly agreed that this statement was inadmissible as having been given without the prescribed <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  But the State maintained that any conceivable "taint" had been dissipated prior to the respondent\'s written confession by McAllister\'s careful administration of the requisite warnings.  The Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 470 U. S. 303</a></p><p> of Appeals reversed respondent\'s conviction, identifying the crucial constitutional inquiry as</p>\n<p>"whether there was a sufficient break in the stream of events between [the] inadmissible statement and the written confession to insulate the latter statement from the effect of what went before."</p>\n<p>61 Ore.App. 673, 676, 658 P.2d 552, 554 (1983).  The Oregon court concluded:</p>\n<p>"Regardless of the absence of actual compulsion, the coercive impact of the unconstitutionally obtained statement remains, because in a defendant\'s mind it has sealed his fate.  It is this impact that must be dissipated in order to make a subsequent confession admissible.  In determining whether it has been dissipated, lapse of time, and change of place from the original surroundings are the most important considerations."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 677, 658 P.2d at 554.</p>\n<p>Because of the brief period separating the two incidents, the "cat was sufficiently out of the bag to exert a coercive impact on [respondent\'s] later admissions." <em>Id.</em> at 678, 658 P.2d at 555.</p>\n<p>The State of Oregon petitioned the Oregon Supreme Court for review, and review was declined.  This Court granted certiorari to consider the question whether the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the suppression of a confession, made after proper <em>Miranda</em> warnings and a valid waiver of rights, solely because the police had obtained an earlier voluntary but unwarned admission from the defendant.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The arguments advanced in favor of suppression of respondent\'s written confession rely heavily on metaphor.  One metaphor, familiar from the Fourth Amendment context, would require that respondent\'s confession, regardless of its integrity, voluntariness, and probative value, be suppressed as the "tainted fruit of the poisonous tree" of the <em>Miranda</em> violation.  A second metaphor questions whether a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 470 U. S. 304</a></p><p> confession can be truly voluntary once the "cat is out of the bag."  Taken out of context, each of these metaphors can be misleading.  They should not be used to obscure fundamental differences between the role of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and the function of <em>Miranda</em> in guarding against the prosecutorial use of compelled statements as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.  The Oregon court assumed and respondent here contends that a failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings necessarily breeds the same consequences as police infringement of a constitutional right, so that evidence uncovered following an unwarned statement must be suppressed as "fruit of the poisonous tree."  We believe this view misconstrues the nature of the protections afforded by <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and therefore misreads the consequences of police failure to supply them.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Prior to <em>Miranda,</em> the admissibility of an accused\'s in-custody statements was judged solely by whether they were "voluntary" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Haynes v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/503/case.html">373 U. S. 503</a></span> (1963); <em>Chambers v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/227/case.html">309 U. S. 227</a></span> (1940).  If a suspect\'s statements had been obtained by "techniques and methods offensive to due process," <em>Haynes v. Washington,</em> 373 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/503/case.html#515">373 U. S. 515</a></span>, or under circumstances in which the suspect clearly had no opportunity to exercise "a free and unconstrained will," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">373 U. S. 514</span>, the statements would not be admitted.  The Court in <em>Miranda</em> required suppression of many statements that would have been admissible under traditional due process analysis by presuming that statements made while in custody and without adequate warnings were protected by the Fifth Amendment.  The Fifth Amendment, of course, is not concerned with nontestimonial evidence.  <em>See Schmerber v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html">384 U. S. 757</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html#764">384 U. S. 764</a></span> (1966) (defendant may be compelled to supply blood samples).  Nor is it concerned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 470 U. S. 305</a></p><p> with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.  <em>See, e.g., California v.

The prophylactic <em>Miranda</em> warnings therefore are \'not themselves rights protected by the Constitution, but [are] instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination [is] protected.\'  <em>Michigan v.

Requiring <em>Miranda</em> warnings before custodial interrogation provides \'practical reinforcement\' for the Fifth Amendment right."</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s contention that his confession was tainted by the earlier failure of the police to provide <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and must be excluded as "fruit of the poisonous tree," assumes the existence of a constitutional violation.

The <em>Wong Sun</em> doctrine applies as well when the fruit of the Fourth Amendment violation is a confession.  It is settled law that</p>\n<p>"a confession obtained through custodial interrogation after an illegal arrest should be excluded unless intervening events break the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the confession so that the confession is \'sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Taylor v.

The purpose of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is to deter unreasonable searches, no matter how probative their fruits.  <em>Dunaway v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html">442 U.

S. 601</a></span>.  Where a Fourth Amendment violation "taints" the confession, a finding of voluntariness for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment is merely a threshold requirement in determining whether the confession may be admitted in evidence.  <em>Taylor v. Alabama, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/687/case.html#690">457 U. S. 690</a></span>.  Beyond this, the prosecution must show a sufficient break in events to undermine the inference that the confession was caused by the Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p>The <em>Miranda</em> exclusionary rule, however, serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps more broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself.  It may be triggered even in the absence of a Fifth Amendment violation. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Fifth Amendment prohibits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 470 U. S. 307</a></p><p> use by the prosecution in its case in chief only of compelled testimony.  Failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings creates a presumption of compulsion.  Consequently, unwarned statements that are otherwise voluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must nevertheless be excluded from evidence under <em>Miranda.</em>  Thus, in the individual case, <em>Miranda\'s</em> preventive medicine provides a remedy even to the defendant who has suffered no identifiable constitutional harm.  <em>See New York v. Quarles, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html#654">467 U. S. 654</a></span>; <em>Michigan v.

S. 444</a></span> (1974).</p>\n<p>But the <em>Miranda</em> presumption, though irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecution\'s case in chief, does not require that the statements and their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted.  Despite the fact that patently voluntary statements taken in violation of <em>Miranda</em> must be excluded from the prosecution\'s case, the presumption of coercion does not bar their use for impeachment purposes on cross-examination.  <em>Harris v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html">401 U. S. 222</a></span> (1971).  The Court in <em>Harris</em> rejected as an "extravagant extension of the Constitution," the theory that a defendant who had confessed under circumstances that made the confession inadmissible, could thereby enjoy the freedom to</p>\n<p>"deny every fact disclosed or discovered as a \'fruit\' of his confession, free from confrontation with his prior statements,"</p>\n<p>and that the voluntariness of his confession would be totally irrelevant.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/case.html#225">401 U. S. 225</a></span>, and n. 2.  Where an unwarned statement is preserved for use in situations that fall outside the sweep of the <em>Miranda</em> presumption, "the primary criterion of admissibility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 470 U. S. 308</a></p><p> [remains] the \'old\' due process voluntariness test."  Schulhofer, Confessions and the Court, 79 Mich.L.Rev. 865, 877 (1981).</p>\n<p>In <em>Michigan v. Tucker, supra,</em> the Court was asked to extend the <em>Wong Sun</em> fruits doctrine to suppress the testimony of a witness for the prosecution whose identity was discovered as the result of a statement taken from the accused without benefit of full <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  As in respondent\'s case, the breach of the <em>Miranda</em> procedures in <em>Tucker</em> involved no actual compulsion.  The Court concluded that the unwarned questioning</p>\n<p>"did not abridge respondent\'s constitutional privilege, . . . but departed only from the prophylactic standards later laid down by this Court in <em>Miranda</em> to safeguard that privilege."</p>\n<p>417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#446">417 U. S. 446</a></span>.  Since there was no actual infringement of the suspect\'s constitutional rights, the case was not controlled by the doctrine expressed in <em>Wong Sun</em> that fruits of a constitutional violation must be suppressed.  In deciding "how sweeping the judicially imposed consequences of a failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings should be," 417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#445">417 U. S. 445</a></span>, the <em>Tucker</em> Court noted that neither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence would be served by suppression of the witness\' testimony.  The unwarned confession must, of course, be suppressed, but the Court ruled that introduction of the third-party witness\' testimony did not violate Tucker\'s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>We believe that this reasoning applies with equal force when the alleged "fruit" of a noncoercive <em>Miranda</em> violation is neither a witness nor an article of evidence, but the accused\'s own voluntary testimony.  As in <em>Tucker,</em> the absence of any coercion or improper tactics undercuts the twin rationales -- trustworthiness and deterrence -- for a broader rule.  Once warned, the suspect is free to exercise his own volition in deciding whether or not to make a statement to the authorities.  The Court has often noted:</p>\n<p>"\'[A] living witness is not to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 470 U. S. 309</a></p><p> mechanically equated with the proffer of inanimate evidentiary objects illegally seized. . . .  [T]he living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and <em>volition</em> interact to determine what testimony he will give.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Ceccolini,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/268/case.html">435 U. S. 268</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/268/case.html#277">435 U. S. 277</a></span> (1978) (emphasis added) (quoting from <em>Smith v. United States,</em> 117 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 3-4, 324 F.2d 879, 881-882 (1963) (Burger, J.) (footnotes omitted), <em>cert. denied,</em> 377 U.S. 954 (1964)).</p>\n<p>Because <em>Miranda</em> warnings may inhibit persons from giving information, this Court has determined that they need be administered only after the person is taken into "custody," or his freedom has otherwise been significantly restrained.  <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#478">384 U. S. 478</a></span>.  Unfortunately, the task of defining "custody" is a slippery one, and "policemen investigating serious crimes [cannot realistically be expected to] make no errors whatsoever."  <em>Michigan v. Tucker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#446">417 U. S. 446</a></span>.  If errors are made by law enforcement officers in administering the prophylactic <em>Miranda</em> procedures, they should not breed the same irremediable consequences as police infringement of the Fifth Amendment itself.  It is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda</em> to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\'s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.  Though <em>Miranda</em> requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Oregon court, however, believed that the unwarned remark compromised the voluntariness of respondent\'s later confession.  It was the court\'s view that the prior <em>answer,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 470 U. S. 310</a></p><p> and not the unwarned questioning, impaired respondent\'s ability to give a valid waiver, and that only lapse of time and change of place could dissipate what it termed the "coercive impact" of the inadmissible statement.  When a prior statement is actually coerced, the time that passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in identity of the interrogators all bear on whether that coercion has carried over into the second confession.  <em>See Westover v. United States,</em> decided together with <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#494">384 U. S. 494</a></span>; <em>Clewis v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/707/case.html">386 U. S. 707</a></span> (1967).  The failure of police to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings does not mean that the statements received have actually been coerced, but only that courts will presume the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination has not been intelligently exercised.  <em>See New York v. Quarles,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/610/case.html#654">476 U. S. 654</a></span>, and n. 5; <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/451/case.html#457">470 U. S. 457</a></span>.  Of the courts that have considered whether a properly warned confession must be suppressed because it was preceded by an unwarned but clearly voluntary admission, the majority have explicitly or implicitly recognized that Westover\'s requirement of a break in the stream of events is inapposite. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In these circumstances, a careful and thorough </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 470 U. S. 311</a></p><p> administration of <em>Miranda</em> warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible.  The warning conveys the relevant information, and thereafter, the suspect\'s choice whether to exercise his privilege to remain silent should ordinarily be viewed as an "act of free will."  <em>Wong Sun v. United States,</em> 371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/case.html#486">371 U. S. 486</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Oregon court nevertheless identified a subtle form of lingering compulsion, the psychological impact of the suspect\'s conviction that he has let the cat out of the bag and, in so doing, has sealed his own fate.  But endowing the psychological effects of <em>voluntary</em> unwarned admissions with constitutional implications would, practically speaking, disable the police from obtaining the suspect\'s informed cooperation even when the official coercion proscribed by the Fifth Amendment played no part in either his warned or unwarned confessions.  As the Court remarked in <em>Bayer:</em></p>\n<p>"[A]fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed.  He can never get the cat back in the bag.  The secret is out for good.  In such a sense, a later confession may always be looked upon as fruit of the first.  But this Court has never gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually disables the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed."</p>\n<p>331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html#540">331 U. S. 540</a></span>-541.  Even in such extreme cases as <em>Lyons v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/596/case.html">322 U. S. 596</a></span> (1944), in which police forced a full confession from the accused through unconscionable methods of interrogation, the Court has assumed that the coercive effect of the confession </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 470 U. S. 312</a></p><p> could, with time, be dissipated.  <em>See also Westover v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#496">384 U. S. 496</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This Court has never held that the psychological impact of voluntary disclosure of a guilty secret qualifies as state compulsion or compromises the voluntariness of a subsequent informed waiver.  The Oregon court, by adopting this expansive view of Fifth Amendment compulsion, effectively immunizes a suspect who responds to pre-<em>Miranda</em> warning questions from the consequences of his subsequent informed waiver of the privilege of remaining silent.  <em>See</em> 61 Ore.App. at 679, 658 P.2d at 555 (Gillette, P. J., concurring).  This immunity comes at a high cost to legitimate law enforcement activity, while adding little desirable protection to the individual\'s interest in not being compelled to testify against himself.  <em>Cf. Michigan v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html">423 U. S. 96</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#107">423 U. S. 107</a></span>-111 (1975) (WHITE, J., concurring in result).  When neither the initial nor the subsequent admission is coerced, little justification exists for permitting the highly probative evidence of a voluntary confession to be irretrievably lost to the factfinder.</p>\n<p>There is a vast difference between the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect\'s will and the uncertain consequences of disclosure of a "guilty secret" freely given in response to an unwarned but noncoercive question, as in this case.  JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s contention that it is impossible to perceive any causal distinction between this case and one involving a confession that is coerced by torture is wholly unpersuasive. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Certainly, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 470 U. S. 313</a></p><p> respondent\'s case, the causal connection between any psychological disadvantage created by his admission and his ultimate decision to cooperate is speculative and attenuated at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 470 U. S. 314</a></p><p> best.  It is difficult to tell with certainty what motivates a suspect to speak.  A suspect\'s confession may be traced to factors as disparate as "a prearrest event such as a visit with a minister," <em>Dunaway v. New York,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html#220">442 U. S. 220</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring), or an intervening event such as the exchange of words respondent had with his father.  We must conclude that, absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.  A subsequent administration of <em>Miranda</em> warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.  In such circumstances, the finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke his rights.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Though belated, the reading of respondent\'s rights was undeniably complete.  McAllister testified that he read the <em>Miranda</em> warnings aloud from a printed card and recorded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 470 U. S. 315</a></p><p> Elstad\'s responses. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  There is no question that respondent knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent before he described his participation in the burglary.  It is also beyond dispute that respondent\'s earlier remark was voluntary, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Neither the environment nor the manner of either "interrogation" was coercive.  The initial conversation took place at midday, in the living room area of respondent\'s own home, with his mother in the kitchen area, a few steps away.  Although in retrospect the officers testified that respondent was then in custody, at the time he made his statement he had not been informed that he was under arrest.  The arresting officers\' testimony indicates that the brief stop in the living room before proceeding to the station house was not to interrogate the suspect, but to notify his mother of the reason for his arrest.  App. 9-10.</p>\n<p>The State has conceded the issue of custody, and thus we must assume that Burke breached <em>Miranda</em> procedures in failing to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings before initiating the discussion in the living room.  This breach may have been the result of confusion as to whether the brief exchange qualified as "custodial interrogation," or it may simply have reflected Burke\'s reluctance to initiate an alarming police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 470 U. S. 316</a></p><p> procedure before McAllister had spoken with respondent\'s mother.  Whatever the reason for Burke\'s oversight, the incident had none of the earmarks of coercion.  <em>See Rawlings v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/98/case.html">448 U. S. 98</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/98/case.html#109">448 U. S. 109</a></span>-110 (1980).  Nor did the officers exploit the unwarned admission to pressure respondent into waiving his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p>Respondent, however, has argued that he was unable to give a fully informed waiver of his rights because he was unaware that his prior statement could not be used against him.  Respondent suggests that Officer McAllister, to cure this deficiency, should have added an additional warning to those given him at the Sheriff\'s office.  Such a requirement is neither practicable nor constitutionally necessary.  In many cases, a breach of <em>Miranda</em> procedures may not be identified as such until long after full <em>Miranda</em> warnings are administered and a valid confession obtained.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bowler,</em> 561 F.2d 1323, 1324-1325 (CA9 1977) (certain statements ruled inadmissible by trial court); <em>United States v. Toral,</em> 536 F.2d 893, 896 (CA9 1976); <em>United States v. Knight,</em> 395 F.2d 971, 974-975 (CA2 1968) (custody unclear).  The standard <em>Miranda</em> warnings explicitly inform the suspect of his right to consult a lawyer before speaking.  Police officers are ill-equipped to pinch-hit for counsel, construing the murky and difficult questions of when "custody" begins or whether a given unwarned statement will ultimately be held admissible.  <em>See Tanner v. Vincent,</em> 541 F.2d 932, 936 (CA2 1976), <em>cert. denied,</em> 429 U.S. 1065 (1977).</p>\n<p>This Court has never embraced the theory that a defendant\'s ignorance of the full consequences of his decisions vitiates their voluntariness.  <em>See California v. Beheler,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1121/case.html#1125">463 U. S. 1125</a></span>-1126, n. 3; <em>McMann v.

If the prosecution has actually violated the defendant\'s Fifth Amendment rights by introducing an inadmissible confession at trial, compelling the defendant to testify in rebuttal, the rule announced in <em>Harrison v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/219/case.html">392 U. S. 219</a></span> (1968), precludes use of that testimony </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 470 U. S. 317</a></p><p> on retrial.</p>\n<p>"Having \'released the spring\' by using the petitioner\'s unlawfully obtained confessions against him, the Government must show that its illegal action did not induce his testimony."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/219/case.html#224">392 U. S. 224</a></span>-225.  But the Court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned State\'s evidence, does so involuntarily.  <em>Frazier v. Cupp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html">394 U. S. 731</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html#739">394 U. S. 739</a></span> (1969).  The Court has also rejected the argument that a defendant\'s ignorance that a prior coerced confession could not be admitted in evidence compromised the voluntariness of his guilty plea.  <em>McMann v. Richardson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/case.html#769">397 U. S. 769</a></span>.  Likewise, in <em>California v. Beheler, supra,</em> the Court declined to accept defendant\'s contention that, because he was unaware of the potential adverse consequences of statements he made to the police, his participation in the interview was involuntary.  Thus we have not held that the <em>sine qua non</em> for a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to remain silent is a full and complete appreciation of all of the consequences flowing from the nature and the quality of the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>When police ask questions of a suspect in custody without administering the required warnings, <em>Miranda</em> dictates that the answers received be presumed compelled and that they be excluded from evidence at trial in the State\'s case in chief.  The Court has carefully adhered to this principle, permitting a narrow exception only where pressing public safety concerns demanded.  <em>See New York v. Quarles,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html#655">467 U. S. 655</a></span>-656.  The Court today in no way retreats from the bright-line rule of <em>Miranda.</em>  We do not imply that good faith excuses a failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings; nor do we condone inherently coercive police tactics or methods offensive to due process that render the initial admission involuntary and undermine the suspect\'s will to invoke his rights once they are read to him.  A handful of courts have, however, applied our precedents relating to confessions obtained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 470 U. S. 318</a></p><p> under coercive circumstances to situations involving wholly voluntary admissions, requiring a passage of time or break in events before a second, fully warned statement can be deemed voluntary.  Far from establishing a rigid rule, we direct courts to avoid one; there is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect\'s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of <em>Miranda,</em> was voluntary. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made.  As in any such inquiry, the finder of fact must examine the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect in evaluating the voluntariness of his statements.  The fact that a suspect chooses to speak after being informed of his rights is, of course, highly probative.  We find that the dictates of <em>Miranda</em> and the goals of the Fifth Amendment proscription against use of compelled testimony are fully satisfied in the circumstances of this case by barring use of the unwarned statement in the case in chief.  No further purpose is served by imputing "taint" to subsequent statements obtained pursuant to a voluntary and knowing waiver.  We hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda</em> warnings.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Oregon is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS expresses puzzlement at our statement that a simple failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings is not, in itself, a violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Yet the Court so held in <em>New York v. Quarles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html">467 U. S. 649</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html#654">467 U. S. 654</a></span> (1983), and <em>Michigan v.

The <em>Miranda</em> Court itself recognized this point when it disclaimed any intent to create a "constitutional straitjacket," and invited Congress and the States to suggest "potential alternatives for protecting the privilege."  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#467">384 U. S. 467</a></span>.  A <em>Miranda</em> violation does not <em>constitute</em> coercion, but rather affords a bright-line, legal presumption of coercion, requiring suppression of all unwarned statements.  It has never been remotely suggested that any statement taken from Mr. Elstad without benefit of <em>Miranda</em> warnings would be admissible.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., United States v.

Without describing each case cited, the following are representative of the situations JUSTICE BRENNAN views as analogous to this case:  <em>e.g., Darwin v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/346/case.html">391 U.

Typical of the state cases cited in the dissent\'s discussion are:  <em>e.g., Cagle v. State,</em> 45 Ala.  App. 3, 4, 221 So.2d 119, 120 (1969) (police interrogated wounded suspect at police station for one hour before obtaining statement, took him to hospital to have his severe wounds treated, only then giving the <em>Miranda</em> warnings; suspect prefaced second statement with "I have already give the Chief a statement and I might as well give one to you, too"), <em>cert. denied,</em> 284 Ala. 727, 221 So.2d 121 (1969); <em>People v.

Likewise inapposite are the cases the dissent cites concerning suspects whose invocation of their rights to remain silent and to have counsel present were flatly ignored while police subjected them to continued interrogation.  <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Sanders v. Rowe,</em> 460 F.Supp. 1128 (ND Ill.1978); <em>People v. Braeseke,</em> 25 Cal.3d 691, 602 P.2d 384 (1979), <em>vacated on other grounds,</em> 446 U.S. 932 (1980); <em>Smith v. State,</em> 132 Ga.App. 491, 208 S.E.2d 351 (1974).  Finally, many of the decisions JUSTICE BRENNAN claims require that the "taint" be "dissipated" simply recite the stock "cat" and "tree" metaphors but go on to find the second confession voluntary without identifying any break in the stream of events beyond the simple administration of a careful and thorough warning. <em>See</em> cases cited in  <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Out of the multitude of decisions JUSTICE BRENNAN cites, no more than half a dozen fairly can be said to suppress confessions on facts remotely comparable to those in the instant case, and some of these decisions involved other elements not present here.  <em>See United States v. Pierce,</em> 397 F.2d 128 (CA4 1968) (thorough custodial interrogation at station house); <em>United States v. Pellegrini,</em> 309 F.Supp. 250, 257 (SDNY 1970) (officers induced unwarned suspect to produce "the clinching evidence of his crime"); <em>In re Pablo A.

Lekas,</em> 201 Kan. 579, 442 P.2d 11 (1968) (parolee taken into custody and questioned at courthouse).  At least one State Supreme Court cited by JUSTICE BRENNAN that read <em>Miranda</em> as mandating suppression of a subsequent voluntary and fully warned confession did so with express reluctance, convinced that admissibility of a subsequent confession should turn on voluntariness alone.  <em>See Brunson v.

Today\'s decision not only extends this effort a further step, but delivers a potentially crippling blow to <em>Miranda</em> and the ability of courts to safeguard the rights of persons accused of crime.  For at least with respect to successive confessions, the Court today appears to strip remedies for <em>Miranda</em> violations of the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine prohibiting the use of evidence presumptively derived from official illegality. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Two major premises undergird the Court\'s decision.  The Court rejects as nothing more than "speculative" the long-recognized presumption that an illegally extracted confession causes the accused to confess again out of the mistaken belief that he already has sealed his fate, and it condemns as "<em>extravagant\'" the requirement that the prosecution affirmatively rebut the presumption before the subsequent confession </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 470 U.

The Court instead adopts a new rule that, so long as the accused is given the usual <em>Miranda</em> warnings before further interrogation, the taint of a previous confession obtained in violation of <em>Miranda</em> "ordinarily" must be viewed as <em>automatically</em> dissipated.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U. S. 311</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>In the alternative, the Court asserts that neither the Fifth Amendment itself nor the judicial policy of deterring illegal police conduct requires the suppression of the "fruits" of a confession obtained in violation of <em>Miranda,</em> reasoning that to do otherwise would interfere with "legitimate law enforcement activity."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U. S. 312</a></span>.  As the Court surely understands, however,</p>\n<p>"[t]o forbid the direct use of methods . . . but to put no curb on their full indirect use would only invite the very methods deemed \'inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Nardone v.

If violations of constitutional rights may not be remedied through the well-established rules respecting derivative evidence, as the Court has held today, there is a critical danger that the rights will be rendered nothing more than a mere "form of words."  <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/251/385/case.html">251 U.

S. 392</a></span> (1920).</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision says much about the way the Court currently goes about implementing its agenda.  In imposing its new rule, for example, the Court mischaracterizes our precedents, obfuscates the central issues, and altogether ignores the practical realities of custodial interrogation that have led nearly every lower court to reject its simplistic reasoning.  Moreover, the Court adopts startling and unprecedented methods of construing constitutional guarantees.  Finally, the Court reaches out once again to address issues not before us.  For example, although the State of Oregon has conceded that the arresting officers broke the law in this case, the Court goes out of its way to suggest that they may have been objectively justified in doing so. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 470 U. S. 321</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Today\'s decision, in short, threatens disastrous consequences far beyond the outcome in this case.  As the Court has not seen fit to provide a full explanation for this result, I believe it essential to consider in detail the premises, reasoning, and implications of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The threshold question is this:  what effect should an admission or confession of guilt obtained in violation of an accused\'s <em>Miranda</em> rights be presumed to have upon the voluntariness of subsequent confessions that are preceded by <em>Miranda</em> warnings?  Relying on the "cat out of the bag" analysis of <em>United States v. Bayer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html">331 U. S. 532</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html#540">331 U. S. 540</a></span>-541 (1947), the Oregon Court of Appeals held that the first confession presumptively taints subsequent confessions in such circumstances.  61 Ore.App. 673, 676, 658 P.2d 552, 554 (1983).  On the specific facts of this case, the court below found that the prosecution had not rebutted this presumption.  Rather, given the temporal proximity of Elstad\'s second confession to his first and the absence of any significant intervening circumstances, the court correctly concluded that there had not been</p>\n<p>"a sufficient break in the stream of events between [the] inadmissible statement and the written confession to insulate the latter statement from the effect of what went before."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid .</em></p>\n<p>If this Court\'s reversal of the judgment below reflected mere disagreement with the Oregon court\'s application of the "cat out of the bag" presumption to the particular facts of this case, the outcome, while clearly erroneous, would be of little lasting consequence.  But the Court rejects the "cat out of the bag" presumption <em>entirely,</em> and instead adopts a new rule presuming that "ordinarily" there is no causal connection between a confession extracted in violation of <em>Miranda</em> and a subsequent confession preceded by the usual <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U. S. 311</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#314">470 U. S. 314</a></span>.  The Court suggests that it is merely following settled lower court practice in adopting this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 470 U. S. 322</a></p><p> rule, and that the analysis followed by the Oregon Court of Appeals was aberrant.  This is simply not so.  Most federal courts have rejected the Court\'s approach, and instead held that (1) there is a rebuttable presumption that a confession obtained in violation of <em>Miranda</em> taints subsequent confessions, and (2) the taint cannot be dissipated solely by giving <em>Miranda</em> warnings. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Moreover, those few federal courts that have suggested approaches similar to the Court\'s have subsequently qualified their positions. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Even more significant is the case among state courts.  Although a handful have adopted the Court\'s approach, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] the overwhelming majority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 470 U. S. 323</a></p><p> of state courts that have considered the issue have concluded that subsequent confessions are presumptively tainted by a first confession taken in violation of <em>Miranda</em> and that <em>Miranda</em> warnings alone cannot dissipate the taint. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 470 U. S. 324</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court today sweeps aside this common-sense approach as "speculative" reasoning, adopting instead a rule that "the psychological impact of voluntary disclosure of a guilty secret" neither "qualifies as state compulsion" nor "compromises the voluntariness" of subsequent confessions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U. S. 312</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#313">470 U. S. 313</a></span> (emphasis added).  So long as a suspect receives the usual <em>Miranda</em> warnings before further interrogation, the Court reasons, the fact that he "is free to exercise his own volition in deciding whether or not to make" further confessions "ordinarily" is a sufficient "cure" and serves to break any causal connection between the illegal confession and subsequent statements.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#308">470 U.

S. 311</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s marble-palace psychoanalysis is tidy, but it flies in the face of our own precedents, demonstrates a startling unawareness of the realities of police interrogation, and is completely out of tune with the experience of state and federal courts over the last 20 years.  Perhaps the Court has grasped some psychological truth that has eluded persons far more experienced in these matters; if so, the Court owes an explanation of how so many could have been so wrong for so many years.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court has had long experience with the problem of confessions obtained after an earlier confession has been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 470 U. S. 325</a></p><p> illegally secured.  Subsequent confessions in these circumstances are not <em>per se</em> inadmissible, but the prosecution must demonstrate facts "sufficient to insulate the [subsequent] statement from the effect of all that went before."  <em>Clewis v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/707/case.html">386 U. S. 707</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/707/case.html#710">386 U. S. 710</a></span> (1967).  If the accused\'s subsequent confession was merely the culmination of "one continuous process," or if the first confession was merely "filled in and perfected by additional statements given in rapid succession," the subsequent confession is inadmissible, even though it was not obtained through the same illegal means as the first.  <em>Leyra v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/556/case.html">347 U. S. 556</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/556/case.html#561">347 U.

The question in each case is whether the accused\'s will was "overborne at the time he confessed," and the prosecution must demonstrate that the second confession "was an act independent of the [earlier] confession."  <em>Reck v. Pate,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/433/case.html">367 U. S. 433</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/433/case.html#440">367 U.

S. 444</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>One of the factors that can vitiate the voluntariness of a subsequent confession is the hopeless feeling of an accused that he has nothing to lose by repeating his confession, even where the circumstances that rendered his first confession illegal have been removed.  As the Court observed in <em>United States v. Bayer,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html#540">331 U. S. 540</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"[A]fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed.  He can never get the cat back in the bag.  The secret is out for good.  In such a sense, a later confession always may be looked upon as a fruit of the first."</p>\n<p>The Court today decries the "irremediable consequences" of this reasoning, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#309">470 U. S. 309</a></span>, but it has always been clear that, even after "let[ting] the cat out of the bag," the accused is not "perpetually disable[d]" from giving an admissible subsequent confession.  <em>United States v. Bayer, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/532/case.html#541">331 U. S. 541</a></span>.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 470 U. S. 326</a></p><p> Rather, we have held that subsequent confessions in such circumstances may be admitted if the prosecution demonstrates that, "[c]onsidering the <em>totality of the circumstances,\'" there was a "`break in the stream of events . . . sufficient to insulate\'" the subsequent confession from the damning impact of the first.  <em>Darwin v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/346/case.html">391 U.

Although we have thus rejected a <em>per se</em> rule forbidding the introduction of subsequent statements in these circumstances, we have emphasized that the psychological impact of admissions and confessions of criminal guilt nevertheless can have a decisive impact in undermining the voluntariness of a suspect\'s responses to continued police interrogation, and must be accounted for in determining their admissibility.  As Justice Harlan explained in his separate <em>Darwin</em> opinion:\n</em></p>\n<p>"A principal reason why a suspect might make a second or third confession is simply that, having already confessed once or twice, he might think he has little to lose by repetition.  If a first confession is not shown to be voluntary, I do not think a later confession that is merely a direct product of the earlier one should be held to be voluntary.  It would be neither conducive to good police work nor fair to a suspect to allow the erroneous impression that he has nothing to lose to play the major role in a defendant\'s decision to speak a second or third time."</p>\n<p>"In consequence, when the prosecution seeks to use a confession uttered after an earlier one not found to be voluntary, it has . . . the burden of proving not only that the later confession was not itself the product of improper threats or promises or coercive conditions, but also that it was not directly produced by the existence of the earlier confession."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/346/case.html#350">391 U.

Standard interrogation manuals advise that "[t]he securing of the first admission is the biggest stumbling block. . . ."  A. Aubry &amp; R. Caputo, Criminal Interrogation 290 (3d ed.1980).  If this first admission can be obtained, "there is every reason to expect that the first admission will lead to others, and eventually to the full confession."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>"For some psychological reason which does not have to concern us at this point, \'the dam finally breaks as a result of the first leak\' with regards to the tough subject. . . .

Some of these "skillfully applied" techniques involve direct confrontation of the suspect with the earlier admission, but many of the techniques are more discreet and create leverage without the need of expressly discussing the earlier admission.  These techniques are all aimed at reinforcing in the suspect\'s mind that, as one manual describes it,</p>\n<p>"\'you\'re wasting your own time, and you\'re wasting my time, you\'re guilty and you know it, I know it, what\'s more, you know that I know it.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 234. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The practical experience of state and federal courts confirms the experts\' understanding.  From this experience, lower courts have concluded that a first confession obtained without proper <em>Miranda</em> warnings, far from creating merely some "speculative and attenuated" disadvantage for the accused, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#313">470 U. S. 313</a></span>, frequently enables the authorities to obtain subsequent confessions on a "silver platter."  <em>Cagle v. State,</em> 45 Ala.  App. 3, 4, 221 So.2d 119, 120, <em>cert. denied,</em> 284 Ala. 727, 221 So.2d 121 (1969).</p>\n<p>One police practice that courts have frequently encountered involves the withholding of <em>Miranda</em> warnings until the end of an interrogation session.  Specifically, the police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 470 U. S. 330</a></p><p> escort a suspect into a room, sit him down and, without explaining his Fifth Amendment rights or obtaining a knowing and voluntary waiver of those rights, interrogate him about his suspected criminal activity.  If the police obtain a confession, it is then typed up, the police hand the suspect a pen for his signature, and -- just before he signs -- the police advise him of his <em>Miranda</em> rights and ask him to proceed.  Alternatively, the police may call a stenographer in after they have obtained the confession, advise the suspect for the first time of his <em>Miranda</em> rights, and ask him to repeat what he has just told them.  In such circumstances, the process of giving <em>Miranda</em> warnings and obtaining the final confession is "<em>merely a formalizing, a setting down almost as a scrivener does, [of] what ha[s] already taken [place].\'"  <em>People v. Raddatz,</em> 91 Ill.App.2d 425, 430, 235 N.E.2d 353, 356 (1968) (quoting trial court).  In such situations, where "it was all over except for reading aloud and explaining the written waiver of the <em>Miranda</em> safeguards," courts have time and again concluded that\n</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he giving of the <em>Miranda</em> warnings before reducing the product of the day\'s work to written form could not undo what had been done or make legal what was illegal."</p>\n<p><em>People v. Bodner,</em> 75 App.Div.2d 440, 448, 430 N.Y.S.2d 433, 438 (1980). [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>There are numerous variations on this theme.  Police may obtain a confession in violation of <em>Miranda</em> and then take a break for lunch or go home for the evening.  When questioning is resumed, this time preceded by <em>Miranda</em> warnings, the suspect is asked to "clarify" the earlier illegal confession and to provide additional information. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Or he is led by one of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 470 U. S. 331</a></p><p> the interrogators into another room, introduced to another official, and asked to repeat his story.  The new officer then gives the <em>Miranda</em> warnings and asks the suspect to proceed. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Alternatively, the suspect might be questioned by arresting officers "in the field" and without <em>Miranda</em> warnings, as was young Elstad in the instant case.  After making incriminating admissions or a confession, the suspect is then brought into the station house and either questioned by the same officers again or asked to repeat his earlier statements to another officer. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The variations of this practice are numerous, but the underlying problem is always the same:  after hearing the witness testimony and considering the practical realities, courts have confirmed the time-honored wisdom of presuming that a first illegal confession "taints" subsequent confessions, and permitting such subsequent confessions to be admitted at trial only if the prosecution convincingly rebuts the presumption.  They have discovered that, frequently, "[h]aving once confessed, [the accused] was ready to confess some more."  <em>State v. Lekas,</em> 201 Kan. 579, 587-588, 442 P.2d 11, 19 (1968).  For all practical purposes, the prewarning and postwarning questioning are often but stages of one overall interrogation.  Whether or not the authorities explicitly confront the suspect with his earlier illegal admissions makes no significant difference, of course, because the suspect knows that the authorities know of his earlier statements, and most frequently will believe that those statements already have sealed his fate.  Thus a suspect in such circumstances is likely to conclude that "he might as well answer the questions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 470 U. S. 332</a></p><p> put to him, since the [authorities are] already aware of the earlier answers," <em>United States v. Pierce,</em> 397 F.2d 128, 131 (CA4 1968); he will probably tell himself that "it\'s O.K., I have already told them," <em>State v. Lekas, supra,</em> at 582, 442 P.2d at 15.  <em>See also Cagle v. State,</em> 45 Ala.  App. at 4, 221 So.2d at 120 ("I have already give[n] the Chief . . . a statement, and I might as well give one to you, too").  In such circumstances, courts have found, a suspect almost invariably asks himself,</p>\n<p>"What use is a lawyer?  What good is a lawyer now?  What benefit can a lawyer tell me?  [<em>sic</em>]  I have already told the police everything."</p>\n<p><em>People v. Raddatz,</em> 91 Ill.App.2d at 430, 235 N.E.2d at 356. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>I would have thought that the Court, instead of dismissing the "cat out of the bag" presumption out of hand, would have accounted for these practical realities.  <em>Compare Nardone v. United States,</em> 308 U.S. at 342 (derivative evidence rules should be grounded on the "learning, good sense, fairness and courage" of lower court judges).  Expert interrogators and experienced lower court judges will be startled, to say the least, to learn that the connection between multiple confessions is "speculative" and that a subsequent rendition of <em>Miranda</em> warnings "ordinarily" enables the accused in these circumstances to exercise his "free will" and to make "a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke his rights."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/687/case.html">457 U. S. 687</a></span> (1982); <em>Brown v.

We have emphasized in this context that</p>\n<p>"verbal evidence which derives so immediately from an unlawful entry and an unauthorized arrest . . . is no less the \'fruit\' of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of the unwarranted intrusion."</p>\n<p><em>Wong Sun v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/case.html#485">371 U.

In part because of the inherent psychological pressures attendant upon an arrest, we have refused to presume that a confession following an illegal arrest is "sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion."  <em>Wong Sun v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/case.html#486">371 U. S. 486</a></span>.  <em>See also Brown v.

If the Court so quickly dismisses the notion of a multiple-confession taint as nothing more than a "speculative and attenuated" disadvantage, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#313">470 U.

By discarding the accepted "cat out of the bag" presumption in the successive confession context, however, the Court now appears to have opened the door to applying this same simplistic reasoning to Fourth Amendment violations.

Thus we have always rejected, until today, the notion that "individual will" alone presumptively serves to insulate a person\'s actions from the taint of earlier official illegality.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

S. 603</a></span> (emphasis in original). [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  <em>See also Taylor v. Alabama,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/687/case.html#690">457 U. S. 690</a></span>-691.  The reason we rejected this rule is manifest:</p>\n<p>"The <em>Miranda</em> warnings in no way inform a person of his Fourth Amendment rights, including his right to be released from unlawful custody following an arrest made without a warrant or without probable cause."</p>\n<p><em>Brown v.

S. 601</a></span>, n. 6.</p>\n<p>This logic applies with even greater force to the Fifth Amendment problem of successive confessions.  Where an accused believes that it is futile to resist because the authorities already have elicited an admission of guilt, the mere rendition of <em>Miranda</em> warnings does not convey the information most critical at that point to ensuring his informed and voluntary decision to speak again:  that the earlier confession may not be admissible, and thus that he need not speak out of any feeling that he already has sealed his fate.  The Court therefore is flatly wrong in arguing, as it does repeatedly, that the mere provision of <em>Miranda</em> warnings prior to subsequent interrogation supplies the accused with "the relevant information" and ensures that a subsequent confession "ordinarily" will be the product of "a rational and intelligent choice" and "<em>an act of free will.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U.

A comparison of the Court\'s analysis with the factors most frequently relied on by lower courts in considering the admissibility of subsequent confessions demonstrates the practical and legal flaws of the new rule.</p>\n<p><em>Advice that earlier confession may be inadmissible.</em>  The most effective means to ensure the voluntariness of an accused\'s subsequent confession is to advise the accused that his earlier admissions may not be admissible, and therefore that he need not speak solely out of a belief that "the cat is out of the bag."  Many courts have required such warnings in the absence of other dissipating factors, [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] and this Court has not uncovered anything to suggest that this approach has not succeeded in the real world.  The Court, however, believes that law enforcement authorities could never possibly understand "the murky and difficult questio[n]" of when </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 470 U. S. 339</a></p><p> <em>Miranda</em> warnings must be given, and therefore that they are "ill-equipped" to make the decision whether supplementary warnings might be required.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#316">470 U. S. 316</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This reasoning is unpersuasive for two reasons.  First, the whole point of <em>Miranda</em> and its progeny has been to prescribe "bright line" rules for the authorities to follow. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] Although borderline cases will of course occasionally arise, thus militating against a <em>per se</em> rule requiring supplementary warnings, the experience of the lower courts demonstrates that the vast majority of confrontations implicating this question involve obvious <em>Miranda</em> violations.  The occasional "murky and difficult" case should not preclude consideration of supplementary warnings in situations where the authorities could not possibly have acted in an objectively reasonable manner in their earlier interrogation of the accused.  Second, even where the authorities are not certain that an earlier confession has been illegally obtained, courts and commentators have recognized that a supplementary warning merely advising the accused that his earlier confession <em>may</em> be inadmissible can dispel his belief that he has nothing to lose by repetition. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Proximity in time and place.</em>  Courts have frequently concluded that a subsequent confession was so removed in time and place from the first that the accused most likely was able fully to exercise his independent judgment in deciding whether to speak again. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  As in the instant case, however, a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 470 U. S. 340</a></p><p> second confession frequently follows immediately on the heels of the first and is obtained by the same officials in the same or similar coercive surroundings.  In such situations, it is wholly unreasonable to assume that the mere rendition of <em>Miranda</em> warnings will safeguard the accused\'s freedom of action.</p>\n<p>The Court today asserts, however, that the traditional requirement that there be a "break in the stream of events" is "inapposite" in this context.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#310">470 U.

[<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  There, the accused was questioned by local authorities for several hours and then turned over to federal officials, who only then advised him of his constitutional rights and obtained a confession.  We concluded that Westover\'s waiver was invalid because, from Westover\'s perspective, the separate questioning amounted to but one continuous period of interrogation, "the warnings came at the end of the interrogation process," and the giving of warnings could not dissipate the effect of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 470 U.

[<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Thus, it is clear that <em>Miranda</em> warnings given at the end of the interrogation process cannot dispel the illegality of what has gone before.  If this is so in a situation like <em>Westover,</em> where the accused had not yet given a confession, how can the Court possibly conclude otherwise where the accused already has confessed, and therefore feels that he has nothing to lose by "confess[ing] some more?"  <em>State v. Lekas,</em> 201 Kan. at 588, 442 P.2d at 19.</p>\n<p><em>Intervening factors.</em>  Some lower courts have found that, because of intervening factors -- such as consultation with a lawyer or family members, or an independent decision to speak -- an accused\'s subsequent confession could not fairly be attributed to the earlier statement taken in violation of <em>Miranda.</em> [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  On the other hand, where, as here, an accused has continuously been in custody and there is no legitimate suggestion of an intervening event sufficient to break the impact of the first confession, subsequent confessions are inadmissible. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  The Court reasons, however, that, because "[a] suspect\'s confession <em>may</em> be traced to . . . an intervening event," it "<em>must</em> [be] conclude[d]" that subsequent <em>Miranda</em> warnings presumptively enable the suspect to make "a rational and intelligent choice" whether to repeat his confession.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#314">470 U.

LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa7 11.4, p. 624 (1978).  The only proper inquiry is whether a meaningful intervening event <em>actually</em> occurred, not whether </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 470 U. S. 342</a></p><p> a court simply chooses to shut its eyes to human nature and the realities of custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p><em>Purpose and flagrancy of the illegality.</em>  Courts have frequently taken the "purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct" into account in considering whether the taint of illegal action was sufficiently dissipated to render a confession admissible.  <em>Brown v. Illinois,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/590/case.html#604">422 U. S. 604</a></span>.  In part, this inquiry has reflected conviction that particularly egregious misconduct must be deterred through particularly stern action.  This factor is also important, however, because it is fair to presume that, if the authorities acted flagrantly in violating the law, they probably did so for ulterior motives.  Thus, if the authorities blatantly failed to advise an accused of his constitutional rights while interrogating him, and gave him the <em>Miranda</em> warnings only as they handed him a typed confession for his signature, it is fair to presume that they pursued their strategy precisely to weaken his ability knowingly and voluntarily to exercise his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps because the Court is discomfited by the radical implications of its failure to apply the settled derivative evidence presumption to violations of <em>Miranda,</em> it grudgingly qualifies its sweeping pronouncements with the acknowledgment that its new presumption about so-called "ordinary" <em>Miranda</em> violations can be overcome by the accused.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U.

To begin with, the Court repeatedly suggests that a confession may be suppressed only if the police have used "improper tactics," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#308">470 U. S. 308</a></span>; this obscure reasoning overlooks the fact that a violation of <em>Miranda</em> is obviously itself an "improper tactic," one frequently used precisely to undermine the voluntariness of subsequent confessions.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#329">470 U. S. 329</a></span>-332.  The Court\'s negative implication that <em>Miranda</em> violations are not "improper tactics" is, to say the least, disquieting.  Second, the Court reasons that the fact that the accused gave a subsequent confession is itself "highly probative" evidence that he was able to exercise his free will.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#318">470 U. S. 318</a></span>.  This inaccurate premise follows from the Court\'s erroneous rejection of the "cat out of the bag" presumption in these circumstances and its inexplicable assertion that the previous extraction of a "guilty secret" neither constitutes compulsion nor compromises the voluntariness of later confessions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U. S. 312</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]  Finally, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 470 U. S. 344</a></p><p> foundation of the derivative evidence doctrine has always been that, where the authorities have acted illegally, they must bear the "ultimate burden" of proving that their misconduct did not "taint" subsequently obtained evidence.  <em>Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U.

That is precisely the point of the derivative evidence presumption.  By rejecting this presumption in <em>Miranda</em> cases, the Court today appears to adopt a "go ahead and try to prove it" posture toward citizens whose Fifth Amendment <em>Miranda</em> rights have been violated, an attitude that marks a sharp break from the Court\'s traditional approach to official lawlessness.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, prudent law enforcement officials must not now believe that they are wholly at liberty to refuse to give timely warnings and obtain effective waivers, confident that evidence derived from <em>Miranda</em> violations will be entirely immune from judicial scrutiny.  I believe that most state and federal courts will continue to exercise the "learning, good sense, fairness and courage" they have displayed in administering the derivative evidence rules prior to today\'s decision.  <em>Nardone v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/338/case.html#342">308 U. S. 342</a></span>.  Lower courts are free to interpret the Court\'s qualifications, grudging though they may be, as providing sufficient latitude to scrutinize confessions obtained in the wake of <em>Miranda</em> violations to determine whether, in light of all "the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct," the initial <em>Miranda</em> violation compromised the voluntariness of the accused\'s subsequent confession.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#318">470 U.

S. 345</a></p><p> use of the illegally secured statement by the police in obtaining the subsequent confession must of course be viewed as powerful evidence of a tainted connection; the Court itself asserts that the officers in this case did not "exploit the unwarned admission to pressure respondent" into giving his subsequent confession.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#316">470 U.

Many of the police practices discussed above do not rely on overt use of the earlier confession at all, but instead are implicit strategies that create leverage on the accused to believe he already has sealed his fate.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#328">470 U. S. 328</a></span>-332.

The Fifth Amendment therefore contains a self-executing rule commanding the exclusion of evidence derived from such communications.

If the authorities were permitted to use an accused\'s illegal confession to extract additional confessions or to uncover physical evidence against him, the use of these fruits at trial would violate the Self-Incrimination Clause just as surely as if the original confession itself were introduced.  Yet that is precisely what today\'s decision threatens to encourage.</p>\n<p>What possible justification does the Court advance for its evisceration of the Fifth Amendment\'s exclusionary rule in this context?  Two rationales appear to be at work here.  First, while acknowledging that a confession obtained in the absence of warnings and an informed waiver is irrebuttably presumed to be coerced in violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#307">470 U.

S. 306</a></span>.  Thus, the Court suggests that a <em>Miranda</em> violation does not constitute "police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 470 U. S. 352</a></p><p> infringement of a constitutional right," that it is not "a constitutional violation," that a suspect in such circumstances "suffer[s] no identifiable constitutional harm," and that his "Fifth Amendment rights" have not "actually [been] violated."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#304">470 U.

Similarly, the Court persists in reasoning that a confession obtained in violation of <em>Miranda</em> "ordinarily" should be viewed as "voluntary," a "voluntary disclosure of a guilty secret," "freely given," "noncoerc[ed]," and "wholly voluntary."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#311">470 U.

An accused in this situation, it is argued, "has a much less sympathetic case for obtaining the benefit of a broad suppression ruling."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Such an analysis overlooks that, by the time we decided <em>Miranda,</em> it was settled that the privilege against self-incrimination applies with full force outside the chambers of "formal" proceedings.</p>\n<p>"Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves."</p>\n<p><em>Miranda v.

Accordingly, <em>Miranda</em> itself emphasized that, under the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule, "<em>no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation</em> can be used against" the defendant unless he was warned of his rights and gave an effective waiver.  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#479">384 U.

Incredibly, faced with an obvious violation of <em>Miranda,</em> the Court asserts that it will not countenance suppression of a subsequent confession in such circumstances where the authorities have acted "legitimate[ly]," and have not used "improper tactics."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U.

One can only respond:  whither went <em>Miranda?</em></p>\n<p>The Court contends, however, that <em>Michigan v. Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html">417 U.

S. 308</a></span>-309.  <em>Tucker</em> did not so decide.  After criticizing the Fifth Amendment basis for exclusion, the Court in <em>Tucker</em> went on to note another "<em>prime purpose\'" for the exclusion of evidence -- "`to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee[s]\'" of the Constitution.  417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#446">417 U.

[<a href="#F2/38" name="T2/38">Footnote 2/38</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, the Court\'s assertion today that <em>Tucker\'s</em> "reasoning applies with equal force" to preclude application of the derivative evidence rule in this case is a gross mischaracterization.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#308">470 U.

The experience of lower courts demonstrates that the police frequently have refused to comply with <em>Miranda</em> precisely in order to obtain incriminating statements that will undermine the voluntariness of the accused\'s decision to speak again once he has received the usual warnings; in such circumstances, subsequent confessions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 470 U.

And the Court\'s suggestion that its analysis might apply generally to "fruits" of illegal interrogations, <em>but see</em> <l=|470 298fn2="" 29|="" u.s.="">n. 29, <em>supra,</em> blinks reality even further.  For example, expert interrogators acknowledge that confessions are "<em>the prime source of other evidence. \'" [<a href="#F2/39" name="T2/39">Footnote 2/39</a>]  If the police, through illegal interrogation, could discover contraband and be confident that the contraband "ordinarily" would not be suppressed, what possible incentive would they have to obey <em>Miranda?</em>\n</em></l=|470></p>\n<p>The Court simply has not confronted the basic premise of the derivative evidence rule:  that</p>\n<p>[t]o forbid the direct use of methods . . . but to put no curb on their full indirect use would only invite the very methods deemed "inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty."</p>\n<p><em>Nardone v.

[<a href="#F2/40" name="T2/40">Footnote 2/40</a>]  Yet that is precisely the result that today\'s disastrous opinion threatens to encourage.  How can the Court possibly expect the authorities to obey <em>Miranda</em> when they have every incentive now to interrogate suspects without warnings or an effective waiver, knowing that the fruits of such interrogations "ordinarily" will be admitted, that an admissible subsequent confession "ordinarily" can be obtained simply by reciting the <em>Miranda</em> warnings shortly after the first has been procured and asking the accused to repeat himself, and that, unless the accused can demonstrate otherwise, his confession will be viewed as an "act of free will" in response to "legitimate law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 470 U.

By condoning such a result, the Court today encourages practices that threaten to reduce <em>Miranda</em> to a mere "form of words," <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States,</em> 251 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/251/385/case.html#392">251 U. S. 392</a></span>, and it is shocking that the Court nevertheless disingenuously purports that it "in no way retreats" from the <em>Miranda</em> safeguards, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#317">470 U. S. 317</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>Not content with its handiwork discussed above, the Court goes on and devotes considerable effort to suggesting that, "[u]nfortunately," <em>Miranda</em> is such an inherently "slippery," "murky," and "difficult" concept that the authorities in general, and the police officer conducting the interrogation in this case in particular, cannot be faulted for failing to advise a suspect of his rights and to obtain an informed waiver.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#309">470 U.

Although borderline cases occasionally have arisen respecting the concepts of "custody" and "interrogation," until today there has been nothing "slippery," "murky," or "difficult" about <em>Miranda</em> in the overwhelming majority of cases.  The whole point of the Court\'s work in this area has been to prescribe "bright line" rules to give clear guidance to the authorities. [<a href="#F2/41" name="T2/41">Footnote 2/41</a>]</p>\n<p>Rather than acknowledge that the police in this case clearly broke the law, the Court bends over backwards to suggest why the officers may have been justified in failing to obey <em>Miranda.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 470 U. S. 360</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  The Court asserts that "[n]either the environment nor the manner of either <em>interrogation\' was coercive," noting that the initial interrogation took place in Elstad\'s "own home."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#315">470 U. S. 315</a></span>.  The Court also believes that,\n</em></p>\n<p>"[a]lthough, in retrospect, the officers testified that respondent was then in custody, at the time he made his statement he had not been informed that he was under arrest."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  There is no question, however, that Michael Elstad was in custody and "deprived of his freedom of action in [a] significant way" at the time he was interrogated.  <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#444">384 U. S. 444</a></span>.  Two police officers had entered his bedroom, ordered him to get out of bed and come with them, stood over him while he dressed, taken him downstairs, and separated him from his mother.  Tr. 64-65, 74-75, 80-84.  The officers themselves acknowledged that Elstad was then under arrest.  <em>Id.</em> at 81-82.  Moreover, we have made clear that police interrogation of an accused in custody triggers the <em>Miranda</em> safeguard even if he is in the "familiar surroundings" of his own home, precisely because he is no less "<em>deprived of his freedom of action\'" there than if he were at a police station.  <em>Orozco v. Texas,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/324/case.html#326">394 U.

The Fifth Amendment\'s requirement of warnings and an informed waiver is "an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#468">384 U. S. 468</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  Without anything in the record to support its speculation, the Court suggests that Officer Burke\'s violation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 470 U. S. 361</a></p><p> of <em>Miranda</em> "may have been the result of confusion as to whether the brief exchange qualified as <em>custodial interrogation\'. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#315">470 U. S. 315</a></span>.  There was no confusion on this point until today.  Burke made Elstad sit down and, standing over him, said "[y]ou know why we\'re here," asked if he knew the Gross family, and "asked what he knew about the burglary."  Tr. 83-84.  This questioning obviously constituted interrogation, because it was "reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response" from Elstad, as it did.  <em>Rhode Island v. Innis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html">446 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#301">446 U. S. 301</a></span> (1980).\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  The Court contends that the interrogation might be excusable because</p>\n<p>"the brief stop in the living room before proceeding to the station house was not to interrogate the suspect, but to notify his mother of the reason for his arrest."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#315">470 U. S. 315</a></span>.  Officer Burke\'s partner did take Elstad\'s mother into the kitchen to inform her of the charges, but Burke took Elstad into another room, sat him down, and interrogated him concerning "what he knew about the burglary."  Tr. 84.  How can the Court possibly describe this interrogation as merely informing Elstad\'s mother of his arrest?</p>\n<p><em>Finally.</em>  The Court suggests that Burke\'s violation of Elstad\'s Fifth Amendment rights</p>\n<p>"may simply have reflected Burke\'s reluctance to initiate an alarming police procedure before McAllister had spoken with respondent\'s mother."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#315">470 U. S. 315</a></span>-316.  As the officers themselves acknowledged, however, the fact that they "[took] the young fellow out of bed" had "[o]bviously" already created "tension and stress" for the mother, Tr. 64, which surely was not lessened when she learned that her son was under arrest.  And if Elstad\'s mother was in earshot, as the Court assumes, it is difficult to perceive how listening to the <em>Miranda</em> warnings would be any more "alarming" to her than what she actually heard -- actual interrogation of her son, including Burke\'s direct accusation that the boy had committed a felony.

It is precisely in that vein, however, that the Court emphasizes that the subsequent confession in this case was "voluntary" and "highly probative evidence," that application of the derivative evidence presumption would cause the confession to be "irretrievably lost," and that such a result would come at an impermissibly "high cost to legitimate law enforcement activity."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U.

If a subsequent confession is truly independent of earlier, illegally obtained confessions, nothing prevents its full use to secure the accused\'s conviction.  If the subsequent confession did result from the earlier illegalities, however, there is nothing "voluntary" about it.  And even if a tainted subsequent confession is "highly probative," we have never until today permitted probity to override the fact that the confession was "the product of constitutionally impermissible methods in [its] inducement."  <em>Rogers v.

Harrison took the stand at his trial in an attempt to rebut illegally obtained confessions that the prosecution had been permitted to introduce into evidence.  His conviction was overturned on appeal because of the introduction of these confessions.  On retrial, Harrison\'s earlier trial testimony was introduced, and led to his second conviction.  We reversed that conviction, reasoning that, if Harrison testified</p>\n<p>"in order to overcome the impact of confessions illegally obtained and hence improperly introduced, then his testimony was tainted by the same illegality that rendered the confessions themselves inadmissible."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/219/case.html#223">392 U.

S. 759</a></span> (1970), held that a defendant\'s guilty plea may not be attacked on federal collateral review on the ground that it was induced by the mistaken assumption that an illegal confession might have been admitted at trial and have led to conviction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/case.html#770">397 U. S. 770</a></span>.  The Court emphasized that this bar applies only when the defendant pleads in "open court" and the decision not to challenge the confession is based on "the good faith evaluations of a reasonably competent attorney."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/case.html#770">397 U. S. 770</a></span>, 773.  Thus, the defendant\'s decision to reiterate the confession is insulated in these circumstances by the assistance of counsel and review by a court -- factors wholly absent in the confession context at hand.  The Court in <em>McMann</em> noted that collateral review is available where the defendant "was incompetently advised by his attorney," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/case.html#772">397 U. S. 772</a></span>, and in light of this qualification, I cannot see how that case is at all analogous to uncounseled decisions to repeat a proximate confession.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Frazier v. Cupp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html">394 U. S. 731</a></span> (1969), the Court held that police misrepresentations concerning an accomplice, while "relevant" to the admissibility of the defendant\'s confession, did not vitiate the voluntariness of the confession under the totality of the circumstances of that case.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html#739">394 U.

If a confession were extracted through savage beatings or other unconscionable techniques, and the accused were then permitted a good night\'s sleep and were questioned the next day by sympathetic officers, most would agree that the subsequent confession, if given out of the defeated feeling that the accused had nothing more to lose, should not be admissible, because it just as surely was the product of torture as the earlier confession.  Yet the Court permitted the admission of just such a confession in <em>Lyons v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/596/case.html">322 U. S. 596</a></span> (1944).  In light of the maturation of our scruples against such techniques over the past 40 years, I believe such a result would be impossible today.  <em>See, e.g., Darwin v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/346/case.html">391 U.

S. 311</a></span>-312.  Although I am confident that the entire Court would never sanction the multiple confession technique employed in <em>Lyons,</em> I nevertheless respectfully submit that it is impossible to perceive any causal distinction between the "guilty secret" consequences of a confession that is presumptively coerced under <em>Miranda</em> and one that is actually coerced through torture.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/26" name="F2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reliance on this qualification undermines the fallacious suggestion elsewhere in its opinion that an illegally obtained "guilty secret" may be used to secure a confession.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U.

Under such circumstances is any waiver the product of a free will and a rational intellect?"</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/28" name="F2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, the Court concedes that its new analysis does not apply where the authorities have ignored the accused\'s actual invocation of his <em>Miranda</em> rights to remain silent or to consult with counsel.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U.

The Court relies heavily on individual "volition" as an insulating factor in successive confession cases.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#308">470 U.

Moreover, because the Court expressly endorses the "bright-line rule of <em>Miranda,</em>" which conclusively presumes that incriminating statements obtained from a suspect in custody without administering the required warnings are the product of compulsion, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] and because the Court places so much emphasis on the special facts of this case, I am persuaded that the Court intends its holding to apply only to a narrow category of cases in which the initial questioning of the suspect was made in a totally uncoercive setting, and in which the first confession obviously had no influence on the second. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  I nevertheless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 470 U. S. 365</a></p><p> dissent, because even such a narrowly confined exception is inconsistent with the Court\'s prior cases, because the attempt to identify its boundaries in future cases will breed confusion and uncertainty in the administration of criminal justice, and because it denigrates the importance of one of the core constitutional rights that protects every American citizen from the kind of tyranny that has flourished in other societies.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The desire to achieve a just result in this particular case has produced an opinion that is somewhat opaque and internally inconsistent.  If I read it correctly, its conclusion rests on two untenable premises:  (1) that the respondent\'s first confession was not the product of coercion, [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] and (2) that no constitutional right was violated when respondent was questioned in a tranquil, domestic setting. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 470 U. S. 366</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Even before the decision in <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), it had been recognized that police interrogation of a suspect who has been taken into custody is presumptively coercive.  That presumption had its greatest force when the questioning occurred in a police station, when it was prolonged, and when there was evidence that the prisoner had suffered physical injury.  To rebut the presumption, the prosecutor had the burden of proving the absence of any actual coercion. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Because police officers are generally more credible witnesses than prisoners, and because it is always difficult for triers of fact to disregard evidence of guilt when addressing a procedural question, more often than not, the presumption of coercion afforded only slight protection to the accused.</p>\n<p>The decision in <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> clarified the law in three important respects.  First, it provided the prosecutor with a simple method of overcoming the presumption of coercion. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  If the police interrogation is preceded by the warning specified in that opinion, the usual presumption does not attach.  Second, it provided an important protection to the accused by making the presumption of coercion irrebuttable if the prescribed warnings are not given. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Third, the decision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 470 U. S. 367</a></p><p> made it clear that a self-incriminatory statement made in response to custodial interrogation was always to be considered "compelled" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution if the interrogation had not been preceded by appropriate warnings. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  Thus, the irrebuttable presumption of coercion that applies to such a self-incriminatory statement, like a finding of actual coercion, renders the resulting confession inadmissible as a matter of federal constitutional law. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 470 U. S. 368</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In my opinion, the Court\'s attempt to fashion a distinction between actual coercion "by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect\'s will," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html#312">470 U. S. 312</a></span>, and irrebuttably presumed coercion cannot succeed.  The presumption is only legitimate if it is assumed that there is always a coercive aspect to custodial interrogation that is not preceded by adequate advice of the constitutional right to remain silent.  Although I would not support it, I could understand a rule that refused to apply the presumption unless the interrogation took place in an especially coercive setting -- perhaps only in the police station itself -- but if the presumption arises whenever the accused has been taken into custody or his freedom has been restrained in any significant way, it will surely be futile to try to develop subcategories of custodial interrogation. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  Indeed, a major purpose of treating the presumption of coercion as irrebuttable is to avoid the kind of fact-bound inquiry that today\'s decision will surely engender. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]</p>\n<p>As I read the Court\'s opinion, it expressly accepts the proposition that routine <em>Miranda</em> warnings will not be sufficient to overcome the presumption of coercion, and thereby make a second confession admissible when an earlier confession is tainted by coercion "by physical violence or other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 470 U. S. 369</a></p><p> deliberate means calculated to break the suspect\'s will." [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  Even in such a case, however, it is not necessary to assume that the earlier confession will always "effectively immunize" a later voluntary confession.  But surely the fact that an earlier confession was obtained by unlawful methods should add force to the presumption of coercion that attaches to subsequent custodial interrogation, and should require the prosecutor to shoulder a heavier burden of rebuttal than in a routine case.  Simple logic, as well as the interest in not providing an affirmative incentive to police misconduct, requires that result.  I see no reason why the violation of a rule that is as well recognized and easily administered as the duty to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings should not also impose an additional burden on the prosecutor. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  If we are faithful to the holding in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 470 U. S. 370</a></p><p> <em>Miranda</em> itself, when we are considering the admissibility of evidence in the prosecutor\'s case in chief, we should not try to fashion a distinction between police misconduct that warrants a finding of actual coercion and police misconduct that establishes an irrebuttable presumption of coercion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>For me, the most disturbing aspect of the Court\'s opinion is its somewhat opaque characterization of the police misconduct in this case.  The Court appears ambivalent on the question whether there was any constitutional violation. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  This ambivalence is either disingenuous or completely lawless.  This Court\'s power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  The same constitutional analysis applies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 470 U. S. 371</a></p><p> whether the custodial interrogation is actually coercive or irrebuttably presumed to be coercive.  If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the <em>Miranda</em> case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  If the Court accepts the proposition that respondent\'s self-incriminatory statement was inadmissible, it must also acknowledge that the Federal Constitution protected him from custodial police interrogation without first being advised of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p>The source of respondent\'s constitutional protection is the Fifth Amendment\'s privilege against compelled self-incrimination that is secured against state invasion by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Like many other provisions of the Bill of Rights, that provision is merely a procedural safeguard.  It is, however, the specific provision that protects all citizens from the kind of custodial interrogation that was once employed by the Star Chamber, [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>] by "the Germans of the 1930\'s and early 1940\'s," [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>] and by some of our own police departments only a few decades ago. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 470 U. S. 372</a></p><p> Custodial interrogation that violates that provision of the Bill of Rights is a classic example of a violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"When police ask questions of a suspect in custody without administering the required warnings, <em>Miranda</em> dictates that the answers received be presumed compelled, and that they be excluded from evidence at trial in the State\'s case in chief.  The Court has carefully adhered to this principle, permitting a narrow exception only where pressing public safety concerns demanded.  <em>See New York v.

Nearly two decades after that disposition, it is undisputed that the <em>Miranda</em> rule -- now so deeply embedded in our culture that most schoolchildren know not only the warnings, but also when they are required -- has given that clarity.  <em>See New York v.
