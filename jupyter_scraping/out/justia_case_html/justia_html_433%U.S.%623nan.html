Subsequently, petitioner sued respondents (Stoner, the company which he and his family controlled, and another corporation with which he had a relationship) in an Illinois state court for breach of the noncompetition covenants.  Shortly thereafter, respondents sued petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that it had violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in that the covenant against competition was an unreasonable restraint of trade.

JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE POWELL join.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>After nine years of litigation in the Illinois state courts, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed a judgment in favor of petitioner and against respondents in the amount of $7,363,500.  Shortly afterwards, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois enjoined, at the behest of respondents, state proceedings to collect the judgment.  403 F.Supp. 527 (1975).  The order of the United States District Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 545 F.2d 1050 (1976), and we granted certiorari to consider the important question of the relationship between state and federal courts which such an injunction raises.  429 U.S. 815 (1976).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Illinois state court litigation arose out of commercial dealings between petitioner and respondents.  In 1959, petitioner Vendo Co., a vending machine manufacturer located in Kansas City, Mo., acquired most of the assets of Stoner Manufacturing, which was thereupon reorganized as respondent Stoner Investments, Inc.  Respondent Harry H. Stoner and members of his family owned all of the stock of Stoner Manufacturing, and that of Stoner Investments.  Stoner Manufacturing had engaged in the manufacture of vending machines which dispensed candy, and, as a part of the acquisition agreement, it undertook to refrain from owning or managing any business engaged in the manufacture or sale of vending machines.  Pursuant to an employment contract, respondent Harry Stoner was employed by petitioner as a consultant for five years at a salary of $50,000, and he agreed that, during the term of his contract and for five years thereafter, he would not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="627">Page 433 U. S. 627</a></p><p> compete with petitioner in the business of manufacturing vending machines.</p>\n<p>In 1965, petitioner sued respondents [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] in state court for breach of these noncompetition covenants.  Shortly thereafter, respondents sued petitioner in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, complaining that petitioner had violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2.  Respondents alleged that the covenants against competition were unreasonable restraints of trade because they were not reasonably limited as to time and place, and that the purpose of petitioner\'s state court lawsuit was to "unlawfully harass" respondents and to "eliminate the competition" of respondents.  App. 22, 25.</p>\n<p>Respondents set up this federal antitrust claim as an affirmative defense to petitioner\'s state court suit.  <em>Id.</em> at 31-32.  However, prior to any ruling by the state courts on the merits of this defense, respondents voluntarily withdrew it.  <em>Id.</em> at 82.</p>\n<p>The state court litigation ran its protracted course, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 433 U. S. 628</a></p><p> two trials, two appeals to the State Appellate Court, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois.  In September, 1974, the latter court affirmed a judgment in favor of petitioner and against respondents in an amount exceeding $7 million.  <em>Vendo Co. v. Stoner,</em> 58 Ill.2d 289, 321 N.E.2d 1.  The Supreme Court of Illinois predicated its judgment on its holding that Stoner had breached a fiduciary duty owed to petitioner, rather than upon any breach of the noncompetitive covenants. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This Court denied respondents\' petition for a writ of certiorari.  420 U.S. 975 (1975).</p>\n<p>During the entire nine-year course of the state court litigation, respondents\' antitrust suit in the District Court was, in the words of the Court of Appeals, allowed to lie "dormant."  545 F.2d at 1055.  But the day after a Circuit Justice of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 433 U. S. 629</a></p><p> Court had denied a stay of execution pending petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois, respondents moved in the District Court for a preliminary injunction against collection of the Illinois judgment.  The District Court in due course granted this motion.</p>\n<p>That court found that it "appear[ed] that the [noncompetition] covenants . . . were overly broad," 403 F.Supp. at 533, and that there was</p>\n<p>"persuasive evidence that Vendo\'s activities in its litigation against the Stoner interests in Illinois state court were not a genuine attempt to use the adjudicative process legitimately."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 534-535.  Recognizing that there is a "paucity of authority" on the issue, <em>id.</em> at 536, the District Court held that the injunctive relief provision of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 26, constitutes an express exception to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, the "Anti-Injunction Act."  The court further found that collection efforts would eliminate two of the three plaintiffs, and thus that the injunction was necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the court within the meaning of that exception to \xc2\xa7 2283.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act was an express exception to \xc2\xa7 2283.  The court did not reach the issue of whether an injunction was necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p>In this Court, petitioner renews its contention that principles of equity, comity, and federalism, as well as the Anti-Injunction Act, barred the issuance of the injunction by the District Court.  Petitioner also asserts in its brief on the merits that the United States District Court was required to give full faith and credit to the judgment entered by the Illinois courts. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Because we agree with petitioner that the District Court\'s order violated the Anti-Injunction Act, we reach none of its other contentions. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 433 U. S. 630</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, provides:</p>\n<p>"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."</p>\n<p>The origins and development of the present Act, and of the statutes which preceded it, have been amply described in our prior opinions, and need not be restated here.  The most recent of these opinions are <em>Mitchum v. Foster,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html">407 U. S. 225</a></span> (1972), and <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/case.html">398 U. S. 281</a></span> (1970).  Suffice it to say that the Act is an absolute prohibition against any injunction of any state court proceedings, unless the injunction falls within one of the three specifically defined exceptions in the Act.  The Act\'s purpose is to forestall the inevitable friction between the state and federal courts that ensues from the injunction of state judicial proceedings by a federal court.  <em>Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html">309 U. S. 4</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html#9">309 U. S. 9</a></span> (1940).  Respondents\' principal contention is that, as the Court of Appeals held, \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes a private action to redress violations of the antitrust laws, comes within the "expressly authorized" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283.</p>\n<p>We test this proposition mindful of our admonition that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy."</p>\n<p><em>Atlantic Coast Line R.

It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"[A]ny person . . . shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by Courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings. . . ."</p>\n<p>38 Stat. 737, 15 U.S.C.\xc2\xa7 26.  On its face, the language merely authorizes private injunctive relief for antitrust violations.  Not only does the statute not mention \xc2\xa7 2283 or the enjoining of state court proceedings, but the granting of injunctive relief under \xc2\xa7 16 is, by the terms of that section, limited to "the same conditions and principles" employed by courts of equity, and by "the rules governing such proceedings."  In 1793, the predecessor to \xc2\xa7 2283 was enacted specifically to limit the general equity powers of a federal court.  <em>Smith v. Apple,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/274/case.html">264 U. S. 274</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/274/case.html#279">264 U.

When \xc2\xa7 16 was enacted in 1914, the bar of the Anti-Injunction Act had long constrained the equitable power of federal courts to issue injunctions.  Thus, on its face, \xc2\xa7 16 is far from an express exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, and may be fairly read as virtually incorporating the prohibitions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 433 U. S. 632</a></p><p> of the Anti-Injunction Act with restrictive language not found, for example, in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See</em> discussion of <em>Mitchum v. Foster, infra.</em></p>\n<p>Respondents rely, as did the Court of Appeals and the District Court, on the following language from <em>Mitchum:</em></p>\n<p>". . .  [I]t is clear that, in order to qualify as an \'expressly authorized\' exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a state court proceeding.  This is not to say that, in order to come within the exception, an Act of Congress must, on its face and in every one of its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute.  <em>The test, rather, is whether an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding.</em>"</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#237">407 U. S. 237</a></span>-238.  (Emphasis added, footnote omitted.)  But we think it is clear that neither this language from <em>Mitchum</em> nor <em>Mitchum\'s ratio decidendi</em> supports the result contended for by respondents.</p>\n<p>The private action for damages conferred by the Clayton Act is a "uniquely federal right or remedy," in that actions based upon it may be brought only in the federal courts.  <em>See General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore &amp; Mich. So. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/261/case.html">260 U.

It thus meets the first part of the test laid down in the language quoted from <em>Mitchum.</em></p>\n<p>But that authorization for private actions does not meet the second part of the <em>Mitchum</em> test; it is not an "Act of Congress . . . [which] could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding," 407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#238">407 U. S. 238</a></span>.  Crucial to our determination in <em>Mitchum</em> that 42 U.S.C. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 433 U. S. 633</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 1983 fulfilled this requirement -- but wholly lacking here -- was our recognition that one of the clear congressional concerns underlying the enactment of \xc2\xa7 1983 was the possibility that state courts, as well as other branches of state government, might be used as instruments to deny citizens their rights under the Federal Constitution.  This determination was based on our review of the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983; similar review of the legislative history underlying \xc2\xa7 16 demonstrates that that section does not meet this aspect of the <em>Mitchum</em> test.</p>\n<p>Section 1983 on its face, of course, contains no reference to \xc2\xa7 2283, nor does it expressly authorize injunctions against state court proceedings.  But, as <em>Mitchum</em> recognized, such language need not invariably be present in order for a statute to come within the "expressly authorized" exception if there exists sufficient evidence in the legislative history demonstrating that Congress recognized and intended the statute to authorize injunction of state court proceedings.  In Part IV of our opinion in <em>Mitchum,</em> we examined <em>in extenso</em> the purpose and legislative history underlying \xc2\xa7 1983, originally \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  We recounted in detail that statute\'s history which made it abundantly clear that, by its enactment, Congress demonstrated its direct and explicit concern to make the federal courts available to protect civil rights against unconstitutional actions of state courts.</p>\n<p>We summarized our conclusion in these words:</p>\n<p>"This legislative history makes evident that Congress clearly conceived that it was altering the relationship between the States and the Nation with respect to the protection of federally created rights; it was concerned that state instrumentalities could not protect those rights; it realized that state officers might, in fact, be antipathetic to the vindication of those rights; and it believed that these failings extended to the state courts."</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#242">407 U. S. 242</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="634">Page 433 U. S. 634</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, in <em>Mitchum,</em> absence of express language authorization for enjoining state court proceedings in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions was cured by the presence of relevant legislative history.  In this case, however, neither the respondents nor the courts below have called to our attention any similar legislative history in connection with the enactment of \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act.  It is not suggested that Congress was concerned with the possibility that state court proceedings would be used to violate the Sherman or Clayton Acts.  Indeed, it seems safe to say that, of the many and varied anticompetitive schemes which \xc2\xa7 16 was intended to combat, Congress in no way focused upon a scheme using litigation in the state courts.  The relevant legislative history of \xc2\xa7 16 simply suggests that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 16, Congress was interested in extending the right to enjoin antitrust violations to private citizens. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 433 U. S. 635</a></p><p> The critical aspects of the legislative history recounted in <em>Mitchum</em> which led us to conclude that \xc2\xa7 1983 was within the "expressly authorized" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 are wholly absent from the relevant history of \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act.  This void is not filled by other evidence of congressional authorization.</p>\n<p>Section 16 undoubtedly embodies congressional policy favoring private enforcement of the antitrust laws, and undoubtedly there exists a strong national interest in antitrust enforcement. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  However, contrary to certain language in the opinion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 433 U. S. 636</a></p><p> of the District Court, 403 F.Supp. at 536, the importance of the federal policy to be "protected" by the injunction is not the focus of the inquiry.  Presumptively, all federal policies enacted into law by Congress are important, and there will undoubtedly arise particular situations in which a particular policy would be fostered by the granting of an injunction against a pending state court action.  If we were to accept respondents\' contention that \xc2\xa7 16 could be given its "intended scope" only by allowing such injunctions, then \xc2\xa7 2283 would be completely eviscerated, since the ultimate logic of this position can mean no less than that virtually <em>all</em> federal statutes [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] authorizing injunctive relief are exceptions to \xc2\xa7 2283.  Certainly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 433 U. S. 637</a></p><p> all federal injunctive statutes are enacted to provide for the suspension of activities antithetical to the federal policies underlying the injunctive statute or related statutes.  If the injunction would issue under the general rules of equity practice -- requiring, <em>inter alia,</em> a showing of irreparable injury -- but for the bar of \xc2\xa7 2283, then clearly \xc2\xa7 2283 in some sense may be viewed as frustrating or restricting federal policy since the activity inconsistent with the federal policy may not be enjoined because of \xc2\xa7 2283\'s bar. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Thus, were we to accede </p><p><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 433 U. S. 638</a></p><p> to respondent\'s interpretation of the "intended scope" language, an exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 would always be found to be "necessary" to give the injunctive Act its full intended scope, and \xc2\xa7 2283 would place no additional limitation on the right </p><p><a class="page-number" name="639">Page 433 U. S. 639</a></p><p> to enjoin state proceedings.  The Anti-Injunction Act, a fixture in federal law since 1793, would then be a virtual dead letter whenever the plaintiff seeks an injunction under a federal injunctive statute.  Whether or not the state proceeding could be enjoined would rest solely upon the traditional principles of equity and comity.  However, as we emphasized in <em>Mitchum,</em> 407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#243">407 U. S. 243</a></span>, the prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 2283 exist separate and apart from these traditional principles, and we cannot read the "intended scope" language as rendering this specific and longstanding statutory provision inoperative simply because important federal policies are fostered by the statute under which the injunction is sought.  Congress itself has found that these policies, in the ordinary case, must give way to the policies underlying \xc2\xa7 2283.  Given the clear prohibition of \xc2\xa7 2283, the courts will not sit to balance and weigh the importance of various federal policies in seeking to determine which are sufficiently important to override historical concepts of federalism underlying \xc2\xa7 2283; by the statutory scheme it has enacted, Congress has clearly reserved this judgment unto itself. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="640">Page 433 U. S. 640</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the "importance," or the potential restriction in scope, of the federal injunction statute does not control for \xc2\xa7 2283 purposes is consistent with the analysis of those very few statutes which we have in the past held to be exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act.  <em>See Mitchum, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#234">407 U.

The original version of the Anti-Injunction Act itself was amended in 1874 to allow federal courts to enjoin state court proceedings which interfere with the administration of a federal bankruptcy proceeding.

The Interpleader Act of 1926, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2361, the Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 203 (1940 ed.), and the Federal Habeas Corpus Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2251, while not directly referring to \xc2\xa7 2283, have nonetheless explicitly authorized injunctive relief against state court proceedings.  The Act of 1851 limiting liability of shipowners, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185, provided that, after deposit of certain funds in the court by the shipowner, "all claims and proceedings against the owner with respect to the matter in question shall cease."

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Section 16 of the Clayton Act, which does not, by its very essence, contemplate or envision any necessary interaction with state judicial proceedings, is clearly not such an Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the Court of Appeals did not reach the issue, the District Court found that, in addition to being "expressly authorized," the injunction was "necessary in aid of its jurisdiction," a separate exception to \xc2\xa7 2283.

Vendo\'s offer to place the Stoner Investment and Lektro-Vend stock under control of the Court does not meet this problem, because, as a matter of substance, Vendo would control both plaintiff and defendant, requiring dismissal under Article III.  Thus, the injunction is also necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the Court."</p>\n<p>403 F.Supp. at 536-537.</p>\n<p>In <em>Toucey v. New York Life Ins.

S. 134</a></span>-135, we acknowledged the existence of a historical exception to the Anti-Injunction Act in cases where the federal court has obtained jurisdiction over the <em>res</em> prior to the state court action.  Although the "necessary in aid of" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 may be fairly read as incorporating this historical <em>in rem</em> exception, <em>see</em> C. Wright, Federal Courts \xc2\xa7 47, p. 204 (3d ed.1976), the federal and state actions here are simply <em>in personam.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="642">Page 433 U.

First, even if the two corporate plaintiffs would cease to litigate the case after execution of the state court judgment, there is no indication that Harry Stoner himself would lose his standing to vindicate his rights, or that the case could not go forward.  Nor does it appear that the two corporate plaintiffs would necessarily be removed from the lawsuit.  As far as the record indicates, there are currently minority shareholders in those corporations whose ownership interests would not be affected by petitioner\'s acquisition of majority stock control of the corporations.  Under the applicable rules for shareholder derivative actions, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 433 U.

Finally, petitioner offered to enter a consent decree which assuredly would eliminate any possibility of petitioner\'s acquiring control of the corporations.  <em>See</em> App. 209-210, 258.  The injunction in this case was therefore, even under the District Courts\' legal theory, not necessary in aid of that court\'s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that neither of the bases relied upon by the District Court constitutes an exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 is more than consistent with the recognition that any doubt must be resolved against the finding of an exception to \xc2\xa7 2283, <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.

As far as the legislative history indicates, the sole purpose of \xc2\xa7 16 (\xc2\xa7 14 in the original drafts) was to extend to private parties the right to sue for injunctive relief.  The following passage, taken in its entirety from H.R.Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1914), demonstrates what Congress had in mind in enacting \xc2\xa7 16:</p>\n<p>"Section 14 authorizes a person, firm, or corporation or association to sue for and have injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity under the rules governing such proceedings.  Under section 7 of the act of July 2, 1890, a person injured in his business and property by corporations or combinations acting in violation of the Sherman antitrust law may recover loss and damage for such wrongful act.  There is, however, no provision in the existing law authorizing a person, firm, corporation, or association to enjoin threatened loss or damage to his business or property by the commission of such unlawful acts, and the purpose of this section is to remedy such defect in the law.  This provision is in keeping with the recommendation made by the President in his message to Congress on the subject of trusts and monopolies."</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> S.Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 17-18 (1914).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>California Motor Transport Co. v.

This Court vacated and remanded to the District Court for consideration, in light of the intervening decision of <em>California Motor Transport,</em> of whether the state court litigation came within the "mere sham" exception announced in <em>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

Those cases together may be cited for the proposition that repetitive, sham litigation in state courts may constitute an antitrust violation, and that an injunction may lie to enjoin future state court litigation.  However, neither of those cases involved the injunction of a pending state court proceeding, and thus the bar of \xc2\xa7 2283 was not brought into play.</p>\n<p>Nothing that we say today cuts back in any way on the holdings of these two cases; what we must here decide is whether such a lawsuit may be enjoined by a federal court after it has been commenced, notwithstanding the bar of the Anti-Injunction Act.  While we conclude that it may not, nothing in our opinion today prevents a federal court, in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction, from enjoining the commencement of additional state court proceedings if it concludes from the course and outcome of the first one that such proceedings would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.  With respect to this future litigation, the injunction will prevent even the commencement of a second such action, and the principles of federalism do not require the bar of \xc2\xa7 2283.  This distinction is totally consistent with the realization that the true <em>bona fides</em> of the initial state court litigation is often not apparent:</p>\n<p>"One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused."</p>\n<p><em>California Motor Transport, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/508/case.html#513">404 U.

JUSTICE STEVENS in his dissent, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#649">433 U. S. 649</a></span>-654, would conclude that, since certain types of state court litigation may violate the antitrust laws, an injunction of such litigation while pending is "expressly authorized" under the provisions of the Anti-Injunction Act.  But this conclusion does not at all follow from the premise that judicial decisions have construed the prohibition of the antitrust laws to include sham and frivolous state court proceedings -- a premise with which we do not at all disagree, <em>see</em> <l=|433 623fn2="" 6|="" u.s.="">n. 6, <em>supra.</em>  The conclusion is supportable only as a matter of policy preference, and not of statutory construction.  Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS\' view, all a federal court need do is find a violation of the federal statute, then, by the very force of that finding, "express authorization" for the statute would be presumed.  But this approach flies in the face of our past decisions.  For example, in <em>Mitchum v. Foster,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html">407 U. S. 225</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#227">407 U. S. 227</a></span> (1972), the petitioner had alleged that the state courts "were depriving him of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments."  Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS\' syllogistic formulation, since the state court action is a violation of \xc2\xa7 1983, the express authorization would be readily found on the face of the statute.  However, the Court in <em>Mitchum</em> found no such <em>ipso facto</em> shortcut to the explicit prohibition of \xc2\xa7 2283, but resorted to careful analysis of the legislative history in order to find evidence of congressional authorization.  In short, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS\' approach, which removes the bar of \xc2\xa7 2283 from all federal injunctive statutes, is totally inconsistent with this Court\'s longstanding recognition that "[l]egislative policy is here expressed in a clear-cut prohibition qualified only by specifically defined exceptions." Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/511/case.html">348 U. S. 511</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/511/case.html#516">348 U. S. 516</a></span> (1955).</l=|433></p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS argues that the Anti-Injunction Act should be "considered wholly inapplicable to later enacted federal statutes that are enforceable exclusively in federal litigation."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#659">433 U. S. 659</a></span>.  But this view is inconsistent with the approach adopted by the Court in <em>Clothing Workers, supra.</em>  In that case, an employer had sought an injunction against a union in state court.  This Court found that the action before the state court was "outside state authority," 348 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/511/case.html#514">348 U. S. 514</a></span>, and that jurisdiction was vested solely in the National Labor Relations Board.  But the Court found that the exclusive federal jurisdiction was not sufficient to render \xc2\xa7 2283 inapplicable.  <em>See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/case.html">398 U. S. 281</a></span> (1970).</p>\n<p>We think MR. JUSTICE STEVENS\' view tends to confuse the jurisdiction granted to federal courts by \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act with the separate question of whether a court having such jurisdiction has also been "expressly authorize[d]" to enjoin state court proceedings.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#650">433 U. S. 650</a></span>-654.  But the question of whether an injunction against state court proceedings has been "expressly authorized" under \xc2\xa7 2283 never arises unless the federal court asked to issue the injunction has subject matter jurisdiction of the case in which the injunction is sought.  Here the District Court is entirely free to proceed with the litigation on the merits of respondents\' antitrust claim against petitioner, and to grant damages and such other relief as may be appropriate if it determines the issues in favor of respondents.  All that we conclude is that it may not include as a part of that relief an injunction against an already pending state court proceeding.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Much of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS dissenting opinion is an able brief for the conceded importance of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.  But however persuasive it might be in inducing Congress to lift the bar of \xc2\xa7 2283 with respect to injunctions issued under \xc2\xa7 16, we do not believe it is persuasive in determining whether, under the present state of the law, Congress has in fact "expressly authorized" the injunction issued by the District Court here.  For example, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS laments that state court proceedings may now become the vehicles by which an antitrust violator may put one independent businessman after another out of business.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#652">433 U.

Federal courts are able to enjoin future repetitive litigation, <em>see</em> discussion of <em>California Motor Transport</em> and <em>Otter Tail Power, supra,</em> <l=|433 623fn2="" 6|="" u.s.="">n. 6.  But even if one were to agree with this broad speculation, the solution is simple and straightforward.  If Congress determines that the use of state court proceedings to foster anticompetitive schemes is of sufficient gravity, it may simply conclude that the need for greater antitrust enforcement outweighs the need to prevent friction in our federal system and amend \xc2\xa7 16 to expressly authorize an injunction of state court proceedings.</l=|433></p>\n<p>No desire for more vigorous antitrust enforcement should cause us to lose sight of our role as judges in interpreting the explicit command of a congressional statute; for notwithstanding the rhetoric of the dissenting opinion, the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 16 is an "expressly authorized" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 is no more than an <em>ipse dixit.</em>  The "explicit wording of \xc2\xa7 2283," <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/case.html#297">398 U.

According to the plurality\'s analysis, \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 26, is not an expressly authorized exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, because it is not</p>\n<p>"an \'Act of Congress . . .

I do not agree that this is invariably the case; since I am of the opinion, however, that the state court proceeding in this case should not have been enjoined by the federal court, I concur in the result.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, application of the <em>Mitchum</em> test for deciding whether a statute is an "expressly authorized" exception to the Anti-Injunction Act shows that \xc2\xa7 16 is such an exception </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 433 U. S. 644</a></p><p> under narrowly limited circumstances.  Nevertheless, consistently with the decision in <em>California Motor Transport Co. v.

California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 433 U. S. 645</a></p><p> <em>Unlimited,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/508/case.html#513">404 U. S. 513</a></span>.  <em>See also Otter Tail Power Co. v.

S. 380</a></span> (1973).</p>\n<p>In my view, the District Court failed properly to apply the <em>California Motor Transport</em> rule.  The court believed that it was enough that Vendo\'s activities in the single state court proceeding involved in this case were not genuine attempts to use the state adjudicative process legitimately.  In reaching this conclusion, the court looked to Vendo\'s purpose in conducting the state litigation and to several negative consequences that the litigation had for respondents.  The court, however, did not find a "pattern of baseless, repetitive claims," nor could it have done so under the circumstances.  Only one state court proceeding was involved in this case, and it resulted in the considered affirmance by the Illinois Supreme Court of a judgment for more than $7 million.  In my opinion, therefore, it cannot be said on this record that Vendo was using the state court proceeding as an anticompetitive device in and of itself.  Thus, I believe that \xc2\xa7 16 itself did not authorize the injunction below, and on this ground I would reverse.</p>\n<p>* I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#661">433 U. S. 661</a></span>-662, that the examples given in the quoted portion of <em>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited</em> necessarily involve the use of the adjudicatory process in the same way that the state courts were being used in this case.  For example, there is no reason to believe that the Court\'s reference to the use of a patent obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor contemplated only one lawsuit.  The case cited in connection with that reference, <em>Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/172/case.html">382 U. S. 172</a></span> (1965), held only that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office could state a claim under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act, where the monopolistic acts alleged included use of the fraudulent patent through a course of action involving both threats of suit and prosecution of an infringement suit.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVES\' quotation from <em>California Motor Transport</em> stops just short of the language that I consider critical to the instant case.  The Court\'s opinion continues:</p>\n<p>"Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process.  Opponents before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other\'s tactics, motions, or defenses, and may readily call them baseless.  One claim which a court or agency may think baseless may go unnoticed, but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.  That may be a difficult line to discern and draw."</p>\n<p>404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/508/case.html#513">404 U. S. 513</a></span>.  Since I believe that federal courts should be hesitant indeed to enjoin ongoing state court proceedings, I am of the opinion that a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims or some equivalent showing of grave abuse of the state courts must exist before an injunction would be proper.  No such finding was made by the District Court in this case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Quite properly, the plurality does not question the merits of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois staying proceedings in the Illinois courts.  It was predicated on appropriate findings of fact, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] it was entered by a District Judge whose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="646">Page 433 U. S. 646</a></p><p> understanding of the federal antitrust laws was unique, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and its entry was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Judge McLaren found substantial evidence that petitioner intended to monopolize the relevant market; that one of the overt acts performed in furtherance thereof was the use of litigation as a method of harassing and eliminating competition; that two of the corporate plaintiffs in the case, respondents here, would be eliminated by collection of the Illinois judgment; and that the state litigation had already severely hampered, and collection of the judgment would prevent, the marketing of a promising, newly developed.machine which would compete with petitioner\'s products.  403 F.Supp. 527, 534 535, 538 (1975). [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The Court of Appeals implicitly endorsed these findings when it noted that</p>\n<p>"[h]ere, Vendo seeks to thwart a federal antitrust suit by the enforcement of state court judgments which are alleged to be the very object of antitrust violations."</p>\n<p>545 F.2d 1050, 1057 (CA7 1976).</p>\n<p>The question which is therefore presented is whether the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 433 U. S. 647</a></p><p> anti-injunction statute [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] deprives the federal courts of power to stay state court litigation which is being prosecuted in direct violation of the Sherman Act.  I cannot believe that any of the members of Congress who unanimously enacted that basic charter of economic freedom [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] in 1890 would have answered that question the way the plurality does today.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The plurality relies on the present form of a provision of the Judiciary Act of 1793. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In the ensuing century, there were changes in our economy which persuaded the Congress that the state courts could not adequately deal with contracts in restraint of trade that affected commerce in more than one </p><p><a class="page-number" name="648">Page 433 U. S. 648</a></p><p> jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The Sherman Act was enacted virtually unanimously in 1890 to protect the national economy from the pernicious effects of regulation by private cartel and to vest the federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="649">Page 433 U. S. 649</a></p><p> courts with jurisdiction adequate to "exert such remedies as would fully accomplish the purposes intended." [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Between 1890 and 1914, although private litigants could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="650">Page 433 U. S. 650</a></p><p> recover treble damages, only the United States could invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts to prevent and restrain violations of the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  When Congress authorized the federal courts to grant injunctive relief in private antitrust litigation, it conferred the same broad powers that the courts possess in cases brought by the Government. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Section </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 433 U. S. 651</a></p><p> 16 of the Clayton Act expressly authorizes injunctions against "a violation of the antitrust laws." [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The scope of the jurisdictional grant is just as broad as the definition of a violation of the antitrust laws.  That definition was deliberately phrased in general language to be sure that "every conceivable act which could possibly come within </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 433 U. S. 652</a></p><p> the spirit or purpose of the prohibition" would be covered by the statute, regardless of whether or not the particular form of restraint was actually foreseen by Congress. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  In the decades following the formulation of the Rule of Reason in 1911, this Court has made it perfectly clear that the prosecution of litigation in a state court may itself constitute a form of violation of the federal statute.</p>\n<p>Thus, the attempt to enforce a patent obtained by fraud, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] or a patent known to be invalid for other reasons, [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] may constitute an independent violation of the Sherman Act; and such litigation may be brought in a state court. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  The prosecution of frivolous claims and objections before regulatory bodies, including state agencies, may violate the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  The enforcement of restrictive provisions in a license to use a patent or a trademark [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] may violate the Sherman Act; such enforcement may, of course, be sought in the state courts.  Similarly, the provisions of a lease, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] or a fair trade  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 433 U. S. 653</a></p><p> agreement, [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] may become the focus of enforcement litigation which has a purpose or effect of frustrating rights guaranteed by the antitrust laws, either in a state or federal court. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  Indeed, the enforcement of a covenant not to compete -- the classic example of a contract in restraint of trade -- typically takes place in a state court. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]</p>\n<p>These examples are sufficient to demonstrate that "litigation in state courts may constitute an antitrust violation. . . ."  <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#635">433 U.

Since the judicial construction of a statute is as much a part of the law as the words written by the legislature, the illegal use of state court litigation as a method of monopolizing or restraining trade is as plainly a violation of the antitrust laws as if Congress had specifically described each of the foregoing cases as an independent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 433 U.

As one of the sponsors of the statute explained, under "this most excellent provision, a man does not have to wait until he is ruined in his business before he has his remedy." [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  But if the plurality\'s interpretation of the legislation were correct, a private litigant might indeed be "ruined in his business before he has his remedy" against state court litigation seeking enforcement of an invalid patent, a covenant not to compete, or an executory merger agreement, to take only a few obvious examples of antitrust violations that might be consummated by state court litigation.</p>\n<p>The plurality assumes that Congress intended to distinguish between illegal state proceedings which are already pending and those which have not yet been filed at the time of a federal court\'s determination that a violation of the antitrust laws has been consummated; the federal court may enjoin the latter, but is powerless to restrain the former.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#635">433 U. S. 635</a></span>-636, n. 6.  Nothing in the history of the anti-injunction statute suggests any such logic-chopping distinction. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]  Indeed, it is squarely at odds with Senator Sherman\'s own explanation of the intended scope of the statutory power "to issue all remedial process or writs proper and necessary to enforce its provisions. . . ." [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]  It would demean the legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 433 U. S. 658</a></p><p> process to construe the eloquent rhetoric which accompanied the enactment of the antitrust laws as implicitly denying federal courts the power to restrain illegal state court litigation simply because it was filed before the federal case was concluded. [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>]  A faithful application of the rationale of <em>Mitchum v. Foster</em> requires a like result in this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The plurality expresses the fear that, if the Clayton Act is given its intended scope, the anti-injunction statute "would be completely eviscerated," since there are 26 other federal statutes which may also be within the "expressly authorized" exception.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#636">433 U. S. 636</a></span>-637, n. 7.  That fear, stated in its strongest terms, is that, in the 184 years since the anti-injunction statute was originally enacted, there are 26 occasions on which Congress has qualified its prohibition to some extent.  There are at least three reasons why this argument should not cause panic.</p>\n<p>First, the early history of the anti-injunction statute indicates that it was primarily intended to prevent the federal courts from exercising a sort of appellate review function in litigation in which the state and federal courts had equal competence.  The statute imposed a limitation on the general equity powers of the federal courts which existed in 1793, and which have been exercised subsequently in diversity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 433 U. S. 659</a></p><p> and other private litigation.  But the anti-injunction statute has seldom, if ever, been construed to interfere with a federal court\'s power to implement federal policy pursuant to an express statutory grant of federal jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  Although there is no need to resolve the question in this case, I must confess that I am not now persuaded that the concept of federalism is necessarily inconsistent with the view that the 1793 Act should be considered wholly inapplicable to later enacted federal statutes that are enforceable exclusively in federal litigation. [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]  If a fair reading of the jurisdictional grant in any such statute does authorize an injunction against state court litigation frustrating the federal policy, nothing in our prior cases would foreclose the conclusion that it is within the "expressly authorized" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283.</p>\n<p>Second, in any event, the question whether the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, for example, gives the federal court the power to enjoin state litigation has little, if any, relevance to the issues presented by this case.  Whatever the answer to that question may be, [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>] that 56-year-old statute will not exacerbate federal-state relations and jeopardize the vitality of "our federalism."  Indeed, even if all the statutes identified by the plurality are within the "expressly authorized" exception to \xc2\xa7 2283, it is extremely doubtful that they would generate as much, or as significant, litigation as either </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 433 U. S. 660</a></p><p> the Civil Rights Act of 1871 or the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F2/34" name="T2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>]  The answer to the important question presented by this case should not depend on speculation about potential consequences for other statutes of relatively less importance to the economy and the Nation.</p>\n<p>Third, concern about the Court\'s ability either to enlarge or to contain the exceptions to the anti-injunction statute, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#635">433 U. S. 635</a></span>-639, is disingenuous, at best.  As originally enacted in 1793, the statute contained no express exception at all.  Those few that were recognized in the ensuing century and a half were the product of judicial interpretation of the statute\'s prohibition in concrete situations.  The codification of the Judicial Code in 1948 restated the exceptions in statutory language, but was not intended to modify the Court\'s power to accommodate the terms of the statute to overriding expressions of national policy embodied in statutes like the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 or the Sherman Act of 1890. [<a href="#F2/35" name="T2/35">Footnote 2/35</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Since the votes of THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN are decisive, a separate comment on MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'s opinion concurring in the result is required.</p>\n<p>His agreement with the proposition that an injunction properly entered pursuant to \xc2\xa7 16 of the Clayton Act is within the "expressly authorized" exception to the anti-injunction statute establishes that proposition as the law for the future.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="661">Page 433 U. S. 661</a></p><p> His view that \xc2\xa7 16 did not authorize the preliminary injunction entered by Judge McLaren is dispositive of this litigation but, for reasons which may be briefly summarized, is not a view that finds any support in the law.</p>\n<p>Unlike the plurality, which would draw a distinction between ongoing litigation and future litigation, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/623/case.html#635">433 U. S. 635</a></span>-636, n. 6, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN differentiates between a violation committed by a multiplicity of lawsuits and a violation involving only one lawsuit.  The very case on which he relies rejects that distinction.  In <em>California Motor Transport Co. v.

Without the most careful review of the record, and the findings and conclusions of the District Court, it is most inappropriate for this Court to reverse on the basis of a contrary view of the facts of the particular case.</p>\n<p>The mere fact that the Illinois courts concluded that petitioner\'s state law claim was meritorious does not disprove the existence of a serious federal antitrust violation.  For if it did, invalid patents, price-fixing agreements, and other illegal covenants in restraint of trade would be enforceable in state courts no matter how blatant the violation of federal law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Apart from the anti-injunction statute, petitioner has argued that principles of equity, comity, and federalism create a bar to injunctive relief in this case.  Brief for Petitioner 36-39.  This argument is supported by three facts:  the Illinois litigation was pending for a period of nine years; the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that respondents were guilty of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 433 U. S. 663</a></p><p> a breach of fiduciary duty; and respondents withdrew their antitrust defense from the state action.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, long periods of delay have been a characteristic of litigation in the Illinois courts.  That is not a reason for a federal court to show any special deference to state courts; quite the contrary, it merely emphasizes the seriousness of any decision by a federal court to abstain, on grounds of federalism, from the prompt decision of a federal question.</p>\n<p>The Illinois Supreme Court\'s conclusion that respondents had violated a fiduciary obligation and that petitioner was entitled to a large damages recovery rested on that court\'s appraisal of the legality of a covenant in restraint of trade. [<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>]  The fact that the covenant not to compete is valid as a matter of state law is irrelevant to the federal antitrust issue.  If, for example, instead of a contract totally excluding respondents from the relevant market, the parties had agreed on a lesser restraint which merely required respondents to sell at prices fixed by petitioner, the Illinois court might also have concluded that respondents were bound by the contract even though the federal courts would have found it plainly violative of the Sherman Act.  The Illinois decision on the merits merely highlights the fact that state and federal courts apply significantly different standards in evaluating contracts in restraint of trade. [<a href="#F2/37" name="T2/37">Footnote 2/37</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="664">Page 433 U. S. 664</a></p><p></p>\n<p>That fact provides the explanation for respondents\' decision to withdraw their federal antitrust defense from the Illinois litigation and to present it to the federal courts.  Congress has granted the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of private antitrust litigation. [<a href="#F2/38" name="T2/38">Footnote 2/38</a>]  Since the state courts do not have the power to award complete relief for an antitrust violation, since state judges are unfamiliar with the complexities of this area of the law, and since state procedures are sometimes unsatisfactory for cases of nationwide scope, no adverse inference should be drawn from a state court defendant\'s election to reserve his federal antitrust claim for decision by a federal court.</p>\n<p>Indeed, since these respondents made that election, and since Congress has withheld jurisdiction of antitrust claims from the state courts, the plurality properly ignores the argument that principles of federalism require abstention in this case.  For a ruling requiring the federal court to abstain from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 433 U. S. 665</a></p><p> the decision of an antitrust issue that might have been raised in a state court proceeding would be tantamount to holding that the federal defense must be asserted in the state action.  Such a holding could not be reconciled with the congressional decision to confer exclusive jurisdiction of the private enforcement of the antitrust laws on the federal courts.  Quite plainly, therefore, this is not the kind of case in which abstention is even arguably proper.</p>\n<p>When principles of federalism are invoked to defend a violation of the Sherman Act, one is inevitably reminded of the fundamental issue that was resolved only a few years before the anti-injunction statute was passed.  Perhaps more than any other provision in the Constitution, it was the Commerce Clause that transformed the ineffective coalition created by the Articles of Confederation into a great Nation.</p>\n<p>"It was . . . to secure freedom of trade, to break down the barriers to its free flow, that the Annapolis Convention was called, only to adjourn with a view to Philadelphia.  Thus, the generating source of the Constitution lay in the rising volume of restraints upon commerce which the Confederation could not check.  These were the proximate cause of our national existence down to today."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"So by a stroke as bold as it proved successful, they founded a nation, although they had set out only to find a way to reduce trade restrictions.  So also, they solved the particular problem causative of their historic action by introducing the commerce clause in the new structure of power."</p>\n<p>". . .  On this fact as much as any other we may safely say rests the vast economic development and present industrial power of the nation.  To it may be credited largely the fact we are an independent and democratic country today."</p>\n<p>W.

One of the parties to such a contract was therefore entitled to enjoin a breach of the agreement by another party.  If such common law relief should be granted by a state court in a comparable situation, and if the plurality\'s interpretation of the statute were accepted, a federal court would be powerless to interfere with state proceedings to enforce such a judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/22" name="F2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p>The text of the statute is quoted in <l=|433 4|="" 623fn2="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>supra.</em></l=|433></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/23" name="F2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>Rather surprisingly, the plurality seems to regard <em>Clothing Workers v.

That case involved a construction of the portion of the Taft-Hartley Act that conferred jurisdiction on the National Labor Relations Board to obtain injunctive relief in certain situations.  The Court rejected the argument that the statute implicitly authorized similar relief for private parties:</p>\n<p>"Congress explicitly gave such jurisdiction to the district courts only on behalf of the Board on a petition by it or \'the officer or regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred.\'  \xc2\xa7 10(j), (1), 61 Stat. 149, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(j), (l).  To hold that the Taft-Hartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to secure interim relief would be to ignore the closely circumscribed jurisdiction given to the District Court and to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.

Indeed, none of the previously recognized statutory exceptions contains any such reference.  Secondly, a federal law need not expressly authorize an injunction of a state court proceeding in order to qualify as an exception.  Three of the six previously recognized statutory exceptions contain no such authorization.  Thirdly, it is clear that, in order to qualify as an \'expressly authorized\' exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a state court proceeding.  This is not to say that, in order to come within the exception, an Act of Congress must, on its face and in every one of its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute.  The test, rather, is whether an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding."</p>\n<p>407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#237">407 U.

In terms of the interest in federalism, since the injunction against litigation typically runs against the parties, rather than the court, there is little difference between denying a citizen access to the state forum and denying him the right to prosecute an existing case to its conclusion.  In either situation, a federal injunction must rest on a determination that an important federal policy outweighs the interest in allowing a state court to resolve a particular controversy.
