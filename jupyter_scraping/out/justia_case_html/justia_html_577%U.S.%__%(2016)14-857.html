Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s subcontractor Mindmatics LLC generated a list of cellular phone numbers for consenting 18- to 24-year-old users and then transmitted the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s message to over 100,000 recipients, including respondent Jose Gomez, who alleges that he did not consent to receive text messages and, at age 40, was not in the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s targeted age group.  Gomez filed a nationwide class action, alleging that Campbell violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA),\n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(1)(A)(iii), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cusing any automatic dialing system\xe2\x80\x9d to send a text message to a cellular telephone, absent the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s prior express consent.  He sought treble statutory damages for a willful and knowing TCPA violation and an injunction against Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in unsolicited messaging. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Before the deadline for Gomez to file a motion for class certification, Campbell proposed to settle Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim and filed an offer of judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.  Gomez did not accept the offer and allowed the Rule 68 submission to lapse on expiration of the time (14 days) specified in the Rule.  Campbell then moved to dismiss the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Campbell argued first that its offer mooted Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim by providing him with complete relief.  Next, Campbell urged that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move for class certification before his individual claim became moot caused the putative class claims to become moot as well.  The District Court denied the motion.  After limited discovery, the District Court granted Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  Relying on <i>Yearsley</i> v. <i>W. A. Ross Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18\n, the court held that Campbell, as a contractor acting on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, acquired the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from suit under the TCPA.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It agreed that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s case remained live but concluded that Campbell was not entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cderivative sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d under <i>Yearsley</i> or on any other basis.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0An unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment does not moot a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case, so the District Court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Article III\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies\xe2\x80\x9d limitation requires that \xe2\x80\x9can actual controversy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43\n (internal quotation marks omitted), but a case does not become moot as \xe2\x80\x9clong as the parties have a concrete interest, however small,\xe2\x80\x9d in the litigation\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, <i>Chafin</i> v. <i>Chafin</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was not effaced by Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s unaccepted offer to satisfy his individual claim.

With no settlement offer operative, the parties remained adverse; both retained the same stake in the litigation they had at the outset.

Unlike the United States and its agencies, federal contractors do not enjoy absolute immunity.  A federal contractor who simply performs as directed by the Government may be shielded from liability for injuries caused by its conduct.  See <i>Yearsley</i>,<i> </i>309 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  But no \xe2\x80\x9cderivative immunity\xe2\x80\x9d exists when the contractor has \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded [its] authority\xe2\x80\x9d or its authority \xe2\x80\x9cwas not validly conferred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.

When a contractor violates both federal law and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s explicit instructions, as alleged here, no immunity shields the contractor from suit.

This question, on which Courts of Appeals have divided, was reserved in <i>Genesis HealthCare Corp.</i> v. <i>Symczyk</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2013) (slip op., at 5, 6, n.\xc2\xa04).  We hold today, in accord with Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that an unaccepted settlement offer has no force.  Like other unaccepted contract offers, it creates no lasting right or obligation.  With the offer off the table, and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s continuing denial of liability, adversity between the parties persists.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case presents a second question.  The claim in suit concerns performance of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contract with the Federal Government.  Does the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit shield the petitioner, a private enterprise, as well?  We hold that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s status as a Government contractor does not entitle it to \xe2\x80\x9cderivative sovereign immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>the blanket immunity enjoyed by the sovereign.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA or Act)\n\n48Stat.\n1064,\n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(1)(A)(iii), prohibits any person, absent the prior express consent of a telephone-call recipient, from \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] any call .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. using any automatic telephone dialing system .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to any telephone number assigned to a paging service [or] cellular telephone service.\xe2\x80\x9d  A text message to a cellular telephone, it is undisputed, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccall\xe2\x80\x9d within the compass of \xc2\xa7227(b)(1)(A)(iii).  768 F. 3d 871, 874 (CA9 2014).

Beginning in 2000, the United States Navy engaged Campbell to develop and execute a multimedia recruiting campaign.  In 2005 and 2006, Campbell proposed to the Navy a campaign involving text messages sent to young adults, the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s target audience, encouraging them to learn more about the Navy.  The Navy approved Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, conditioned on sending the messages only to individuals who had \xe2\x80\x9copted in\xe2\x80\x9d to receipt of marketing solicitations on topics that included service in the Navy.  App. 42.  In final form, the message read:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cDestined for something big?  Do it in the Navy.  Get a career.  An education.

In May 2006, Mindmatics transmitted the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s message to over 100,000 recipients.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent Jose Gomez was a recipient of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting message.  Alleging that he had never consented to receiving the message, that his age was nearly 40, and that Campbell had violated the TCPA by sending the message (and perhaps others like it), Gomez filed a class-action complaint in the District Court for the Central District of California in 2010.  On behalf of a nationwide class of individuals who had received, but had not consented to receipt of, the text message, Gomez sought treble statutory damages, costs, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, also an injunction against Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in unsolicited messaging.  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Prior to the agreed-upon deadline for Gomez to file a motion for class certification, Campbell proposed to settle Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim and filed an offer of judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a\xe2\x80\x9361a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Campbell offered to pay Gomez his costs, excluding attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and $1,503 per message for the May 2006 text message and any other text message Gomez could show he had received, thereby satisfying his personal treble-damages claim.  <i>Id.,</i> at 53a.  Campbell also proposed a stipulated injunction in which it agreed to be barred from sending text messages in violation of the TCPA.  The proposed injunction, however, denied liability and the allegations made in the complaint, and disclaimed the existence of grounds for the imposition of an injunction.  <i>Id</i>., at 56a.  The settlement offer did not include attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, Campbell observed, because the TCPA does not provide for an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s-fee award.  <i>Id.,</i> at 53a.  Gomez did not accept the settlement offer and allowed Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 68 submission to lapse after the time, 14 days, specified in the Rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Campbell thereafter moved to dismiss the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  No Article III case or controversy remained, Campbell urged, because its offer mooted Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim by providing him with complete relief.  Gomez had not moved for class certification before his claim became moot, Campbell added, so the putative class claims also became moot.  The District Court denied Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  805 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 923 (CD Cal. 2011).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Gomez was not dilatory in filing his certification request, the District Court determined; consequently, the court noted, the class claims would \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] back\xe2\x80\x9d to the date Gomez filed the complaint.  <i>Id.,</i> at 930\xe2\x80\x93931.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After limited discovery, Campbell moved for summary judgment on a discrete ground.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. Navy enjoys the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit under the TCPA, Campbell argued.  The District Court granted the motion.  Relying on our decision in <i>Yearsley</i> v. <i>W. A. Ross Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18 (1940)\n, the court held that, as a contractor acting on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, Campbell acquired the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s immunity.  No. CV 10\xe2\x80\x9302007DMG (CD Cal., Feb. 22, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a\xe2\x80\x9334a, 2013 WL 655237.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the summary judgment entered for Campbell.  768 F.\xc2\xa03d 871.  The appeals court disagreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the immunity issue, but agreed that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s case remained live.  Concerning Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim, the Court of Appeals relied on its then-recent decision in <i>Diaz</i> v. <i>First American Home Buyers Protection Corp.</i>, 732 F.\xc2\xa03d 948 (2013).  <i>Diaz</i> held that \xe2\x80\x9can unaccepted Rule 68 offer that would fully satisfy a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s [individual] claim is insufficient to render th[at] claim moot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 950.  As to the class relief Gomez sought, the Ninth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9can unaccepted Rule 68 offer of judgment\xe2\x80\x94for the full amount of the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification\xe2\x80\x94does not moot a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  768 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 875 (quoting <i>Pitts </i>v.<i> Terrible Herbst, Inc.</i>, 653 F.\xc2\xa03d 1081, 1091\xe2\x80\x931092 (CA9 2011)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Next, the Court of Appeals held that Campbell was not entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cderivative sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Yearsley</i> or on any other basis.  768 F. 3d, at 879\xe2\x80\x93881.

Nothing in Rule 68 alters that basic principle; to the contrary, that rule specifies that \xe2\x80\x98[a]n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x99  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(b).  So assuming the case was live before\xe2\x80\x94because the plaintiff had a stake and the court could grant relief\xe2\x80\x94the litigation carries on, unmooted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We now adopt Justice Kagan\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, as has every Court of Appeals ruling on the issue post <i>Genesis HealthCare</i>.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Accordingly, we hold that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was not effaced by Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s unaccepted offer to satisfy his individual claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As earlier recounted, see <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x934, Gomez commenced an action against Campbell for violation of the TCPA, suing on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.  Gomez sought treble statutory damages and an injunction on behalf of a nationwide class, but Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s settlement offer proposed relief for Gomez alone, and it did not admit liability.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a.  Gomez rejected Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s settlement terms and the offer of judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under basic principles of contract law, Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s settlement bid and Rule 68 offer of judgment, once rejected, had no continuing efficacy.  See <i>Genesis HealthCare</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).  Absent Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance, Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s settlement offer remained  only a proposal, binding neither Campbell nor Gomez.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a (\xe2\x80\x9cPlease advise whether Mr. Gomez will accept [Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s] offer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Having rejected Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s settlement bid, and given Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s continuing denial of liability, Gomez gained no entitlement to the relief Campbell previously offered.  See <i>Eliason</i> v. <i>Henshaw</i>, 4 Wheat. 225, 228 (1819) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an undeniable principle of the law of contracts, that an offer of a bargain by one person to another, imposes no obligation upon the former, until it is accepted by the latter .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, with no settlement offer still operative, the parties remained adverse; both retained the same stake in the litigation they had at the outset.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Federal Rule in point, Rule 68, hardly supports the argument that an unaccepted settlement offer can moot a complaint.  An offer of judgment, the Rule provides, \xe2\x80\x9cis considered withdrawn\xe2\x80\x9d if not accepted within 14 daysof its service.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(a), (b).  The sole built-in sanction: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the [ultimate] judgment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 68(d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In urging that an offer of judgment can render a controversy moot, Campbell features a trio of 19th-century railroad tax cases: <i>California</i> v. <i>San Pablo &amp; Tulare R. Co.</i>,\n\n149 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308 (1893)\n, <i>Little</i> v. <i>Bowers</i>,\n\n134 U.\xc2\xa0S. 547 (1890)\n, and <i>San Mateo County</i> v<i>. Southern Pacific R. Co.</i>,\n\n116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138 (1885)\n.  None of those decisions suggests that an <i>unaccepted</i> settlement offer can put a plaintiff out of court.  In <i>San Pablo</i>, California had sued to recover state and county taxes due from a railroad.  In response, the railroad had not merely offered to pay the taxes in question.  It had actually deposited the full amount demanded in a California bank in the State\xe2\x80\x99s name, in accord with a California statute that \xe2\x80\x9cextinguished\xe2\x80\x9d the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s tax obligations upon such payment.  149 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  <i>San Pablo</i> thus rested on California\xe2\x80\x99s substantive law, which required the State to accept a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s full payment of the amount in controversy.  <i>San Mateo</i> and <i>Little </i>similarly involved actual payment of the taxes for which suit was brought.  In all three cases, the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s payments had fully satisfied the asserted tax claims, and so extinguished them.  <i>San Mateo</i>, 116 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141\xe2\x80\x93142; <i>Little</i>, 134 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 556.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In contrast to the cases Campbell highlights, when the settlement offer Campbell extended to Gomez expired, Gomez remained emptyhanded; his TCPA complaint, which Campbell opposed on the merits, stood wholly unsatisfied.  Because Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim was not made moot by the expired settlement offer, that claim would retain vitality during the time involved in determining whether the case could proceed on behalf of a class.  While a class lacks independent status until certified, see <i>Sosna</i> v. <i>Iowa</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393,\n399 (1975)\n, a would-be class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show that certification is warranted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent asserts that our decision transfers authority from the federal courts and \xe2\x80\x9chands it to the plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 10.  Quite the contrary.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach would place the defendant in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.  We encountered a kindred strategy in <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.</i> v. <i>Bonner Mall Partnership</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18 (1994)\n.  The parties in <i>Bancorp</i> had reached a voluntary settlement while the case was pending before this Court.  <i>Id.,</i> at 20.  The petitioner then sought vacatur of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, contending that it should be relieved from the adverse decision on the ground that the settlement made the dispute moot.  The Court rejected this gambit.  <i>Id.,</i> at 25.  Similarly here, Campbell sought to avoid a potential adverse decision, one that could expose it to damages a thousand-fold larger than the bid Gomez declined to accept.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, an unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment does not moot a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case, so the District Court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  That ruling suffices to decide this case.  We need not, and do not, now decide whether the result would be different if a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff, and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.  That question is appropriately reserved for a case in which it is not hypothetical.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The second question before us is whether Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s status as a federal contractor renders it immune from suit for violating the TCPA by sending text messages to unconsenting recipients.  The United States and its agencies, it is undisputed, are not subject to the TCPA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions because no statute lifts their immunity.  Brief for Peti-tioner 2; Brief for Respondent 43.  Do federal contractors share the Government\xe2\x80\x99s unqualified immunity from liability and litigation?  We hold they do not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnment contractors obtain certain immunity in connection with work which they do pursuant to their contractual undertakings with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Roosevelt S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</i>,\n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575,\n583 (1943)\n.  That immunity, however, unlike the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s, is not absolute.  See <i>id.,</i> at 580\xe2\x80\x93581.  Campbell asserts \xe2\x80\x9cderivative sovereign immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 35, but can offer no authority for the notion that private persons performing Government work acquire the Government\xe2\x80\x99s embracive immunity.  When a contractor violates both federal law and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s explicit instructions, as here alleged, no \xe2\x80\x9cderivative immunity\xe2\x80\x9d shields the contractor from suit by persons adversely affected by the violation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Campbell urges that two of our decisions support its \xe2\x80\x9cderivative immunity\xe2\x80\x9d defense: <i>Yearsley</i>,<i> </i>\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18\n, and <i>Filarsky</i> v. <i>Delia</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).  In <i>Yearsley</i>, a landowner asserted a claim for damages against a private company whose work building dikes on the Missouri River pursuant to its contract with the Federal Government had washed away part of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s land.  We held that the contractor was not answerable to the landowner.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he work which the contractor had done in the river bed,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas all authorized and directed by the Government of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperformed pursuant to the Act of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  309 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to carry out the project was validly conferred, that is, if what was done was within the constitutional power of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no liability on the part of the contractor\xe2\x80\x9d who simply performed as the Government directed.  <i>Id.</i>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  The Court contrasted with <i>Yearsley </i>cases in which a Government agent had \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded his authority\xe2\x80\x9d or the authority \xe2\x80\x9cwas not validly conferred\xe2\x80\x9d; in those circumstances, the Court said, the agent could be held liable for conduct causing injury to another.  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Filarsky</i>, we considered whether a private attorney temporarily retained by a municipal government as an investigator could claim qualified immunity in an action brought under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.

Qualified immunity reduces the risk that contractors will shy away from government work.

In opposition to summary judgment, Gomez presented evidence that the Navy authorized Campbell to send text messages only to individuals who had \xe2\x80\x9copted in\xe2\x80\x9d to receive solicitations.  App. 42\xe2\x80\x9344; 768 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 874.  A Navy representative noted the importance of ensuring that the message recipient list be \xe2\x80\x9ckosher\xe2\x80\x9d (<i>i.e., </i>that all recipients had consented to receiving messages like the recruiting text), and made clear that the Navy relied on Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s representation that the list was in compliance.  App. 43.  See also <i>ibid.</i> (noting that Campbell itself encouraged the Navy to use only an opt-in list in order to meet national and local law requirements).  In short, the current record reveals no basis for arguing that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s right to remain message-free was in doubt or that Campbell complied with the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not overlook that subcontractor Mindmatics, not Campbell, dispatched the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting message to unconsenting recipients.

The Ninth Circuit deferred to that ruling, 768 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 878, and we have no cause to question it.  Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s vicarious liability for Mindmatics\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, however, in no way advances Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s contention that it acquired the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit based on its contract with the Navy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 provides, in relevant part:\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Because Campbell had already answered the complaint, the District Court construed Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a request for summary judgment.  805 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 927, n.\xc2\xa02.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending proceedings in this Court.

In <i>Alvarez</i>, the Court found moot claims for injunctive and declaratory relief in relation to cars and cash seized by the police.  Through separate state-court proceedings, the State had \xe2\x80\x9creturned all the cars that it seized,\xe2\x80\x9d and the plaintiff-property owners had \xe2\x80\x9ceither forfeited any relevant cash or ha[d] accepted as final the State\xe2\x80\x99s return of some of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89, 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  <i>Alvarez</i> thus resembles the railroad tax cases described above: The <i>Alvarez</i> plaintiffs had in fact received all the relief they could claim, all \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying property disputes\xe2\x80\x9d had ended, <i>id.,</i> at 89, and as the complaint sought \xe2\x80\x9conly declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 92, no continuing controversy remained.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0If there had been a taking of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s property, the Courtnoted, \xe2\x80\x9ca plain and adequate remedy\xe2\x80\x9d would be at hand, <i>i.e., </i>recovery from the United States of \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yearsley</i>, 309 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 21.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We disagree with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it described <i>Yearsley</i> as \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ing] a narrow rule regarding claims arising out of property damage caused by public works projects.\xe2\x80\x9d  768 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 879.

But, in my view, the Court does not advance a sound basis for this conclusion.  The Court rests its conclusion on modern contract law principles and a recent dissent concerning Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.  See <i>ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x939.  I would rest instead on the common-law history of tenders.  That history\xe2\x80\x94which led to Rule 68\xe2\x80\x94demonstrates that a mere offer of the sum owed is insufficient to eliminate a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to decide the case to which the offer related.  I therefore concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text of Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement, that requirement\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history, and our precedents do not appear to provide sufficiently specific principles to resolve this case.  When faced with such uncertainty, it seems particularly important for us to look to how courts traditionally have viewed a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offer to pay the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s alleged damages.  That history\xe2\x80\x94which stretches from the common law directly to Rule 68 and modern settlement offers\xe2\x80\x94reveals one unbroken practice that should resolve this case: A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offer to pay the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x94without more\xe2\x80\x94would not have deprived a court of jurisdiction.  Campbell-Ewald\xe2\x80\x99s offers thus do not bar federal courts from continuing to hear this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Modern settlement procedure has its origins in the law of tenders, as refined in the 18th and 19th centuries.  As with much of the early common law, the law of tenders had many rigid formalities.  These formalities make clear that, around the time of the framing, a mere offer of relief was insufficient to deprive a court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At common law, a prospective defendant could prevent a case from proceeding, but he needed to provide substantially more than a bare offer.  A \xe2\x80\x9cmere proposal or proposition\xe2\x80\x9d to pay a claim was inadequate to end a case.  A. Hunt, A Treatise on the Law of Tender, and Bringing Money Into Court \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x932, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (1903) (Hunt) (citing cases from the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s).  Nor would a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creadiness and an ability to pay the money\xe2\x80\x9d suffice to end a case.  <i>Holmes </i>v. <i>Holmes</i>, 12 Barb. 137, 144 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1851).  Rather, a prospective defendant needed to provide a \xe2\x80\x9ctender\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an offer to pay the entire claim before a suit was filed, accompanied by \xe2\x80\x9cactually produc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the sum \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of tender\xe2\x80\x9d in an \xe2\x80\x9cunconditional\xe2\x80\x9d manner.  M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law, 314\xe2\x80\x93315, 321 (1856) (citing cases from the early 1800\xe2\x80\x99s).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, in state and federal courts, a tender of the amount due was deemed \xe2\x80\x9can admission of a liability\xe2\x80\x9d on the cause of action to which the tender related, so any would-be defendant who tried to deny liability could not effectuate a tender.  Hunt \xc2\xa7400, at 448; see <i>Cottier </i>v.<i> Stimpson</i>, 18 F. 689, 691 (Ore. 1883) (explaining that a tender constitutes \xe2\x80\x9can admission of the cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>The Rossend Castle Dillenback </i>v.<i> The Rossend Castle</i>, 30 F. 462, 464 (SDNY 1887) (same).  As one treatise explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] tender must be of a specific sum which the tenderor <i>admits</i> to be due\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[t]here must be no denial of the debt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hunt \xc2\xa7242, at 253 (emphasis added).  The tender had to offer and actually deliver complete relief.

And an offer to pay less than what was demanded was not a valid tender.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Elderkin </i>v.<i> Fellows</i>, 60 Wis. 339, 340\xe2\x80\x93341, 19 N.\xc2\xa0W. 101, 102 (1884).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even when a potential defendant properly effectuated a tender, the case would not necessarily end.

This history also demonstrates that courts at common law would not have understood a mere offer to strip them of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although 19th-century state statutes expanded the common-law-tender regime, the law retained its essential features.  See Bone, \xe2\x80\x9cTo Encourage Settlement\xe2\x80\x9d: Rule 68, Offers of Judgment, and the History of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 102 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1561, 1585 (2008) (Bone).  These changes, for example, allowed defendants to offer a tender \xe2\x80\x9cduring the pendency of an action,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as before it commenced.  <i>Taylor </i>v.<i> Brooklyn Elevated R.\xc2\xa0Co.</i>, 119 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 561, 564, 23 N.\xc2\xa0E. 1106, 1107 (1890); cf. <i>Colby </i>v.<i> Reed</i>,\n\n99 U.\xc2\xa0S. 560,\n566 (1879)\n<i> </i>(at common law, generally no \xe2\x80\x9cright of tender after action brought\xe2\x80\x9d).  Statutes also expanded the right of tender to cover types of actions in which damages were not certain.  Compare <i>Dedekam </i>v.<i> Vose</i>, 7 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 337, 338 (SDNY 1853) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]ender could not be maintained, according to the strict principles of the common law\xe2\x80\x9d in cases where damages were not easily ascertainable), with<i> Patrick </i>v.<i> Illawaco Oyster Co.</i>, 189 Wash. 152, 155, 63 P.\xc2\xa02d 520, 521 (1937) (state statute \xe2\x80\x9cextend[ed] the common-law rule\xe2\x80\x9d to tort actions).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nevertheless, state statutes generally retained the core of the common-law tender rules.  Most critically for this case, a mere offer remained insufficient to end a lawsuit.  See, <i>e.g., Kilts </i>v.<i> Seeber, </i>10 How. Pr. 270, 271 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1854)<i> </i>(under New York law, a mere offer was insufficient to preclude litigation).  Like the common-law tender rules, state statutes recognized that plaintiffs could continue to pursue litigation by rejecting an offer.  See Bone<i> </i>1586.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The offer-of-judgment procedure in Rule 68 was modeled after a provision in the New York Field Code that was enacted in the mid-19th century.  See <i>id</i>., at 1583\xe2\x80\x931584.  That code abrogated many of the common-law formalities governing civil procedure.  Among its innovations, the code allowed defendants in any cause of action to make an offer in writing to the plaintiff proposing to accept judgment against the defendant for a specified sum.  See The Code of Procedure of the State of New York From 1848 to 1871: Comprising the Act as Originally Enacted and the Various Amendments Made Thereto, to the Close of the Session of 1870 \xc2\xa7385, p. 274 (1870).  The plaintiff could accept the offer, which would end the litigation, or reject the offer, in which case the offer was considered with drawn without any admission of liability by the defendant.  <i>Ibid. </i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1938, Rule 68 was adopted as part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and has subsisted throughout the years without material changes.  See Bone 1564.  As it did in 1938, Rule 68 now authorizes \xe2\x80\x9ca party defending against a claim\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cserve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 68(a).  Rule 68 also provides a plaintiff the option to accept or reject an offer.  If the plaintiff accepts the offer, the \xe2\x80\x9cclerk must then enter judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rules 68(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Withdrawn offers (unlike common-law tenders) cannot be used in court as an admission against defendants.  Rule 68(b).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In light of the history discussed above, a rejected offer does not end the case.  And this consistent historical practice demonstrates why Campbell-Ewald\xe2\x80\x99s offers do not divest a federal court of jurisdiction to entertain Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Campbell-Ewald made two settlement offers after Gomez sued\xe2\x80\x94one filed with the District Court under Rule 68 and one freestanding settlement offer.  But with neither of these offers did the company make payment; it only declared its intent to pay.  Because Campbell-Ewald only offered to pay Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s claim but took no further steps, the court was not deprived of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the Court reaches the right result, I cannot adopt its reasoning.  Building on the dissent in <i>Genesis HealthCare Corp.</i> v. <i>Symczyk</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), the Court relies on principles of contract law that an unaccepted offer is a legal nullity.  But the question here is not whether Campbell-Ewald\xe2\x80\x99s offer formed an enforceable contract.  The question is whether its continuing offer of complete relief eliminated the case or controversy required by Article III.  By looking only to contract law and one recent Rule 68 opinion, the Court fails to confront this broader issue.  Instead, I believe that we must resolve the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d in Article III by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe traditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of common-law courts\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chave virtually no meaning except by reference to that tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Honig </i>v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305,\n340 (1988)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent argues that examining whether the requirements of common-law tenders have been met does not answer \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is a case or controversy for purposes of Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa03.  As explained above, however, courts have historically refused to dismiss cases when an offer did not conform to the strict tender rules.  The logical implications of The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning are that the common-law-tender rules conflict with Article III and that the Constitution bars Article III courts from following those principles.  But see <i>Colby</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 566 (stating that, to stop litigation, a party \xe2\x80\x9cmust adopt the measure prescribed by the common law, except in jurisdictions where a different mode of proceeding is prescribed by statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  That reasoning, therefore, calls into question the history and tradition that the case-or-controversy requirement embodies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Chief Justice also contends that our precedents \xe2\x80\x9cplainly establish that an admission of liability is not required for a case to be moot under Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>,<i> </i>at 10, n.\xc2\xa03.  But we need not decide today whether compliance with every common-law formality would be necessary to end a case.  The dispositive point is that state and federal courts have not considered a mere offer, without more, sufficient to moot the case.  None of the cases cited by The Chief Justice hold that a retrospective claim for money damages can become moot based on a mere offer. <i>California</i> v. <i>San Pablo &amp; Tulare R. Co</i>.,\n\n149 U.S. 308 (1893)\n, is inapposite because that decision involved a fully tendered offer that extinguished the tax debt under California law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  <i>Alvarez</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n558 U.S. 87 (2009)\n, and <i>Already, LLC</i> v. <i>Nike, Inc.</i>, 568 U.S. ___ (2013), are also not on point.  Both involved claims for injunctive or declaratory relief that became moot when the defendants ceased causing actual or threatened injury.  But whether a claim for prospective relief is moot is different from the issue in this case, which involves claims for damages to remedy past harms.  See, <i>e.g., Parents Involved in Community Schools </i>v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701,\n720 (2007)\n (plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9csought damages in her complaint, which is sufficient to preserve our ability to consider the question\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Alvarez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 92 (suggesting that a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing controversy over damages\xe2\x80\x9d would mean that the case was not moot).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As explained above, I would follow history and tradition in construing Article III, and so I find that Campbell-Ewald\xe2\x80\x99s mere offers did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment only.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the common law strongly encouraged a plaintiff to accept a tender by penalizing plaintiffs who improperly rejected them.

Jose Gomez alleges that the marketing firm Campbell-Ewald (Campbell) sent him text messages without his permission, and he requests relief under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  That Act permits consumers to recover statutory damages for unauthorized text messages.  Based on Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, the maximum that he could recover under the Act is $1500 per text message, plus the costs of filing suit.  Campbell has offered to pay Gomez that amount, but it turns out he wants more.  He wants a federal court to say he is right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem for Gomez is that the federal courts exist to resolve real disputes, not to rule on a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to relief already there for the taking.  As this Court has said, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Raines</i> v. <i>Byrd</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 811,\n818 (1997)\n (quoting <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26,\n37 (1976)\n).  If there is no actual case or controversy, the lawsuit is moot, and the power of the federal courts to declare the law has come to an end.  Here, the District Court found that Campbell agreed to fully satisfy Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  That makes the case moot, and Gomez is not entitled to a ruling on the merits of a moot case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 1793, President George Washington sent a letter to Chief Justice John Jay and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, asking for the opinion of the Court on the rights and obligations of the United States with respect to the war between Great Britain and France.  The Supreme Court politely\xe2\x80\x94but firmly\xe2\x80\x94refused the request, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lines of separation drawn by the Constitution between the three departments of the government\xe2\x80\x9d pro-hibit the federal courts from issuing such advisory opinions.  3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486\xe2\x80\x93489 (H. Johnston ed. 1890\xe2\x80\x931893).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That prohibition has remained \xe2\x80\x9cthe oldest and most consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen</i>,\n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n96 (1968)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  And for good reason.  It is derived from Article III of the Constitution, which limits the authority of the federal courts to the adjudication of \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72.  The case or controversy requirement is at once an important check on the powers of the Federal Judiciary and the source of those powers.  In <i>Marbury </i>v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), Chief Justice Marshall established that it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not because there is a provision in the Constitution that says so\xe2\x80\x94there isn\xe2\x80\x99t.  Instead, the federal courts wield that power because they have to decide cases and controversies, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hose who apply [a] rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Federal courts may exercise their authority \xe2\x80\x9conly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R.

A plaintiff demonstrates a personal stake by establishing standing to sue, which requires a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allen</i>, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 751.  A defendant demonstrates a personal stake through \xe2\x80\x9can ongoing interest in the dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Camreta</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 701.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The personal stake requirement persists through every stage of the lawsuit.  It \xe2\x80\x9cis not enough that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9cparties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit\xe2\x80\x9d to prevent the case from becoming moot.  <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Continental Bank Corp.</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472\n\xe2\x80\x93478 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If either the plaintiff or the defendant ceases to have a concrete interest in the outcome of the litigation, there is no longer a live case or controversy.  A federal court that decides the merits of such a case runs afoul of the prohibition on advisory opinions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying those basic principles to this case, it is clear that the lawsuit is moot.  All agree that at the time Gomez filed suit, he had a personal stake in the litigation.  In his complaint, Gomez alleged that he suffered an injury in fact when he received unauthorized text messages from Campbell.  To remedy that injury, he requested $1500 in statutory damages for each unauthorized text message.  (It was later determined that he received only one text message.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What happened next, however, is critical: After Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s initial legal volley, Campbell did not return fire.  Instead, Campbell responded to the complaint with a freestanding offer to pay Gomez the maximum amount that he could recover under the statute: $1500 per unauthorized text message, plus court costs.  Campbell also made an offer of judgment on the same terms under Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits a defendant to recover certain attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees if the Rule 68 offer is unaccepted and the plaintiff later recovers no more than the amount of the offer.  Crucially, the District Court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cparties do not dispute\xe2\x80\x9d that Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 68 offer\xe2\x80\x94reflecting the same terms as the freestanding offer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwould have fully satisfied the individual claims asserted, or that could have been asserted,\xe2\x80\x9d by Gomez.  805 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 923, 927 (CD Cal. 2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When a plaintiff files suit seeking redress for an alleged injury, and the defendant <i>agrees </i>to fully redress that injury, there is no longer a case or controversy for pur-poses of Article III.  After all, if the defendant is willing to remedy the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury without forcing him to litigate, the plaintiff cannot demonstrate an injury in need of redress by the court, and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interests are not adverse to the plaintiff.  At that point, there is no longer any \xe2\x80\x9cnecessity\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cexpound and interpret\xe2\x80\x9d the law, <i>Marbury</i>, 1 Cranch, at 177, and the federal courts lack authority to hear the case.  That is exactly what happened here: Once Campbell offered to fully remedy Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s injury, there was no longer any \xe2\x80\x9cnecessity\xe2\x80\x9d for the District Court to hear the merits of his case, rendering the lawsuit moot.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that although Campbell has offered Gomez full relief, Campbell has not yet paid up.  That does not affect the mootness inquiry under the facts of this case.  Campbell is a multimillion dollar company, and the settlement offer here is for a few thousand dollars.  The settlement offer promises \xe2\x80\x9cprompt payment,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, and it would be mere pettifoggery to argue that Campbell might not make good on that promise.  In any event, to the extent there is a question whether Campbell is willing and able to pay, there is an easy answer: have the firm deposit a certified check with the trial court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court today holds that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit is not moot.  According to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cAn unaccepted settlement offer\xe2\x80\x94like any unaccepted contract offer\xe2\x80\x94is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (quoting <i>Genesis HealthCare Corp. </i>v.<i> Symczyk</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3)).  And so, the Court concludes, if a plaintiff does not feel like accepting the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s complete offer of relief, the lawsuit cannot be moot because it is as if no offer had ever been made.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But a plaintiff is not the judge of whether federal litigation is necessary, and a mere <i>desire </i>that there be federal litigation\xe2\x80\x94for whatever reason\xe2\x80\x94does not make it <i>necessary</i>.  When a lawsuit is filed, it is up to the federal court to determine whether a concrete case or controversy exists between the parties.  That remains true throughout the litigation.  Article III does not require the parties to affirmatively agree on a settlement before a case becomes moot.  This Court has long held that when a defendant unilaterally remedies the injuries of the plaintiff, the case is moot\xe2\x80\x94even if the plaintiff disagrees and refuses to settle the dispute, and even if the defendant continues to deny liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>California</i> v. <i>San Pablo &amp; Tulare R. Co.</i>,\n\n149 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308 (1893)\n, the State of California brought suit against a railroad company for back taxes.  Before oral argument in this Court, the railroad offered to pay California the entire sum at issue, \xe2\x80\x9ctogether with interest, penalties and costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 313.  Although California continued to litigate the case despite the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s offer of complete relief, the Court concluded that the offer to pay the full sum, in addition to \xe2\x80\x9cthe deposit of the money in a bank, which by a statute of the State ha[s] the same effect as actual payment and receipt of the money,\xe2\x80\x9d mooted the case.  <i>Id.,</i> at 314.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court grounded its decision in <i>San Pablo</i> on the prohibition against advisory opinions, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Although the majority here places great weight on Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s offer of complete relief, <i>San Pablo</i> did not consider the agreement of the parties to be relevant to the question of mootness.  As the Court said then, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o stipulation of parties or counsel, whether in the case before the court or in any other case, can enlarge the power, or affect the duty, of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More recently, in <i>Alvarez</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 87 (2009)\n, the Court found that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to settle a case did not prevent it from becoming moot.  In <i>Alvarez</i>, Chi-cago police officers had seized vehicles and cash from six individuals.  The individuals filed suit against the city and two officials, claiming that they were entitled to a timely post-seizure hearing to seek the return of their property.  The Court of Appeals ruled for the plaintiffs, and this Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At oral argument, the parties informed the Court that the cars and some of the cash had been returned, and that the plaintiffs no longer sought the return of the remainder of the cash.  <i>Id.</i>, at 92.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94much like Gomez\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccontinue[d] to dispute the lawfulness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s hearing procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 93.  Although the plaintiffs refused to settle the case, and the defendants would not concede that the hearing procedures were unlawful, the Court held that the case was moot.  As the Court explained, the \xe2\x80\x9cdispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 particular legal rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca dispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the scope of the constitutional words \xe2\x80\x98Cases\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Controversies.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court reached a similar conclusion in <i>Already, LLC </i>v. <i>Nike, Inc.</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  In that case, Nike filed suit alleging that two of Already\xe2\x80\x99s athletic shoes violated Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Air Force 1 trademark.  In response, Already filed a counterclaim alleging that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s trademark was invalid.  Instead of litigating the counterclaim, Nike issued a <i>unilateral</i> covenant not to sue Already.  In that covenant, Nike \xe2\x80\x9cunconditionally and irrevocably\xe2\x80\x9d promised not to raise any trademark or unfair competition claims against Already based on its current shoe designs or any future \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable imitations\xe2\x80\x9d of those designs.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).  Nike did not, however, admit that its trademark was invalid.  After issuing the covenant, Nike asked the District Court to dismiss the counterclaim as moot.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Already did not agree to Nike\xe2\x80\x99s covenant, and it did not view the covenant as sufficient to protect it from future trademark litigation.  Already argued that without judicial resolution of the dispute, \xe2\x80\x9cNike\xe2\x80\x99s trademarks [would] hang over Already\xe2\x80\x99s operations like a Damoclean sword.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).  This Court disagreed and dismissed the suit.  It found that because Nike had demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cthat the covenant encompasses all of [Nike\xe2\x80\x99s] allegedly unlawful conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d the counterclaim was moot.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These precedents reflect an important constitutional principle: The agreement of the plaintiff is not required to moot a case.  In <i>San Pablo</i>, California did not accept the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s money in exchange for settling the State\xe2\x80\x99s legal claims; in <i>Alvarez</i>, the plaintiffs did not receive their cars and cash in return for an agreement to stop litigating the case; and in <i>Already</i>, the eponymous shoe company never agreed to Nike\xe2\x80\x99s covenant not to sue.  In each of those cases, despite the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s desire not to settle, the Court held that the lawsuit was moot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority attempts to distinguish these precedents by emphasizing that the plaintiffs in all three cases received complete relief, but that is not the point.  I had thought that the theory of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was that acceptance is required before complete relief will moot a case.  But consider the majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of <i>Already</i>: What did Nike\xe2\x80\x99s covenant do?  It \xe2\x80\x9cafforded Already blanket protection from future trademark litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10, n.\xc2\xa05.  What happened as a result of this complete relief\xc2\xa0?  \xe2\x80\x9cThe risk that underpinned Already\xe2\x80\x99s standing\xe2\x80\x9d thus \xe2\x80\x9cceased to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Even though what?

The question, however, is not whether there is a contract; it is whether there is a case or controversy under Article III.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  If the defendant is willing to give the plaintiff everything he asks for, there is no case or controversy to adjudicate, and the lawsuit is moot.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The case or controversy requirement serves an essential purpose: It ensures that the federal courts expound the law \xe2\x80\x9conly in the last resort, and as a necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allen</i>, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 752 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is the necessity of resolving a live dispute that reconciles the exercise of profound power by unelected judges with the principles of self-governance, ensuring adherence to \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 750 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no such necessity here.  As the District Court found, Campbell offered Gomez full relief.  Although Gomez nonetheless wants to continue litigating, the issue is not what the plaintiff <i>wants</i>, but what the federal courts may do.  It is up to those courts to decide whether each party continues to have the requisite personal stake in the lawsuit, and if not, to dismiss the case as moot.  The Court today takes that important responsibility away from the federal courts and hands it to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The good news is that this case is limited to its facts.  The majority holds that an <i>offer</i> of complete relief is insufficient to moot a case.  The majority does not say that <i>payment</i> of complete relief leads to the same result.  For aught that appears, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis may have come out differently if Campbell had deposited the offered funds with the District Court.  See <i>ante,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  This Court leaves that question for another day\xe2\x80\x94assuming there are other plaintiffs out there who, like Gomez, won\xe2\x80\x99t take \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d for an answer.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court does not reach the question whether Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s claim for class relief prevents this case from becoming moot.

But under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents Gomez does not have standing to seek relief based solely on the alleged injuries of others, and Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s interest in sharing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees among class members or in obtaining a class incentive award does not create Article III standing.

But Campbell made Gomez both a Rule 68 offer <i>and</i> a freestanding settlement offer.  By its terms, Rule 68 does not apply to the latter.

I agree that a defendant may extinguish a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s personal stake in pursuing a claim by offering complete relief on the claim, even if the plaintiff spurns the offer.  Our Article III precedents make clear that, for mootness purposes, there is nothing talismanic about the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance.  <i>E.g., Already, LLC</i> v. <i>Nike, Inc.</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013) (holding that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral covenant not to sue mooted Already\xe2\x80\x99s trademark invalidity claim).  I write separately to emphasize what I see as the linchpin for finding mootness in this case: There is no real dispute that Campbell would \xe2\x80\x9cmake good on [its] promise\xe2\x80\x9d to pay Gomez the money it offered him if the case were dismissed.  <i>Ante, </i>at 5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Absent this fact, I would be compelled to find that the case is not moot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary cessation\xe2\x80\x9d cases provide useful guidance.  Those cases hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to enjoin a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Knox</i> v. <i>Service Employees</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  To obtain dismissal in such circumstances, the defendant must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bea[r] the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Already</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167,\n190 (2000)\n).  We have typically applied that rule in cases involving claims for prospective relief, see <i>Knox</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 7), but the basic principle easily translates to cases, like this one, involving claims for damages: When a defendant offers a plaintiff complete relief on a damages claim, the case will be dismissed as moot if\xe2\x80\x94but only if\xe2\x80\x94it is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the plaintiff will be able to receive the offered relief.  <i>Already</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 8).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider an offer of complete relief from a defendant that has no intention of actually paying the promised sums, or from a defendant whose finances are so shaky that it cannot produce the necessary funds.  In both instances, there is a question whether the defendant will back up its offer to pay with an actual payment.  If those cases were dismissed as moot, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to follow through on its promise to pay would leave the plaintiff forever emptyhanded.  In the language of our mootness cases, those cases would <i>not</i> be moot because a court could still grant the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9ceffectual relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Knox</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94namely, the relief sought in the first place.  The plaintiff retains a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal stake\xe2\x80\x9d in continuing the litigation.  <i>Genesis HealthCare Corp.</i> v. <i>Symczyk</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  An offer of complete relief thus will not always warrant dismissal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Campbell urges that a plaintiff could simply move to reopen a dismissed case if a defendant fails to make good on its offer.  Reply Brief 10.  I assume that is true.  But the prospect of having to reopen litigation is precisely why our voluntary cessation cases require defendants to prove, <i>before</i> dismissal, that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury cannot reasonably be expected to recur.  I see no reason not to impose a similar burden when a defendant asserts that it has rendered a damages claim moot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">How, then, can a defendant make \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely clear\xe2\x80\x9d that it will pay the relief it has offered?  The most straightforward way is simply to pay over the money.  The defendant might hand the plaintiff a certified check or deposit the requisite funds in a bank account in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s name.  See <i>California</i> v. <i>San Pablo &amp; Tulare R. Co.</i>,\n\n149 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n\xe2\x80\x93314 (1893).  Alternatively, a defendant might deposit the money with the district court (or another trusted intermediary) on the condition that the money be released to the plaintiff when the court dismisses the case as moot.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 67; 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72041, 2042.  In these situations, there will rarely be any serious doubt that the plaintiff can obtain the offered money.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While outright payment is the surest way for a defendant to make the requisite mootness showing, I would not foreclose other means of doing so.  The question is whether it is certain the defendant will pay, not whether the defendant has already paid.  I believe Campbell clears the mark in this case.  As The Chief Justice observes, there is no dispute Campbell has the means to pay the few thousand dollars it offered Gomez, and there is no basis \xe2\x80\x9cto argue that Campbell might not make good on that promise\xe2\x80\x9d if the case were dismissed.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 5.  Thus, in the circumstances of this case, Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s offer of complete relief should have rendered Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s damages claim moot.  But the same would not necessarily be true for other defendants, particularly those that face more substantial claims, possess less secure finances, or extend offers of questionable sincerity.  Cf. <i>Already</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (emphasizing the \xe2\x80\x9cformidable burden on the party asserting mootness\xe2\x80\x9d and noting possible \xe2\x80\x9cdoubts that Nike\xe2\x80\x99s showing [of mootness] would suffice in other circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court does not dispute Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s ability or willingness to pay, but nonetheless concludes that its unaccepted offer did not moot Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  While I disagree with that result on these facts, I am heartened that the Court appears to endorse the proposition that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim <i>is </i>moot once he has \xe2\x80\x9creceived full redress\xe2\x80\x9d from the defendant for the injuries he has asserted.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa05 (discussing <i>Already</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Alvarez</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 87 (2009)\n).<i> </i> Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision thus does not prevent a defendant who actually pays complete relief\xe2\x80\x94either directly to the plaintiff or to a trusted intermediary\xe2\x80\x94from seeking dismissal on mootness grounds.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0I say it must be clear that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cwill<i> be able to </i>receive\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>the relief, rather than that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9c<i>will </i>receive\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>the relief, to account for the possibility of an obstinate plaintiff who refuses to take any relief even if the case is dismissed.
