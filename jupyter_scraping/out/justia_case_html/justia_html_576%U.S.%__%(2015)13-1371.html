In Texas, the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department) distributes the credits.  The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact claim under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), alleging that the Department and its officers had caused continued segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods.  Relying on statistical evidence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  After assuming the Department\xe2\x80\x99s proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.  While the Department\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.  The Fifth Circuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA, but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had left predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs, the Act addresses the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1988, Congress amended the FHA, and, as relevant here, created certain exemptions from liability.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Two antidiscrimination statutes that preceded the FHA are relevant to its interpretation.  Both \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) authorize disparate-impact claims.  Under <i>Griggs</i> v. <i>Duke Power Co.</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424\n, and <i>Smith</i> v. <i>City of Jackson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228\n, the cases announcing the rule for Title VII and for the ADEA, respectively, antidiscrimination laws should be construed to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory purpose.  Disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain the free-enterprise system.  Before rejecting a business justification\xe2\x80\x94or a governmental entity\xe2\x80\x99s analogous public interest\xe2\x80\x94a court must determine that a plaintiff has shown that there is \xe2\x80\x9can available alternative .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. practice that has less disparate impact and serves the [entity\xe2\x80\x99s] legitimate needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557\n.  These cases provide essential background and instruction in the case at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Under the FHA it is unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9crefuse to sell or rent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to a person because of race\xe2\x80\x9d or other protected characteristic, \xc2\xa7804(a), or \xe2\x80\x9cto discriminate against any person in\xe2\x80\x9d making certain real-estate transactions \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of race\xe2\x80\x9d or other protected characteristic, \xc2\xa7805(a).  The logic of <i>Griggs</i> and <i>Smith </i>provides strong support for the conclusion that the FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.  The results-oriented phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise make unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the consequences of an action rather than the actor\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Giles</i>,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41\n.  And<i> </i>this phrase is equivalent in function and purpose to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s and the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise adversely affect\xe2\x80\x9d language.  In all three statutes the operative text looks to results and plays an identical role: as a catchall phrase, located at the end of a lengthy sentence that begins with prohibitions on disparate treatment.  The introductory word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d also signals a shift in emphasis from an actor\xe2\x80\x99s intent to the consequences of his actions.  This similarity in text and structure is even more compelling because Congress passed the FHA only four years after Title VII and four months after the ADEA.  Although the FHA does not reiterate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s exact language, Congress chose words that serve the same purpose and bear the same basic meaning but are consistent with the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and objectives.  The FHA contains the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of race,\xe2\x80\x9d but Title VII and the ADEA also contain that wording and this Court nonetheless held that those statutes impose disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified such liability.  Congress knew that all nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question had concluded the FHA encompassed disparate-impact claims, and three exemptions from liability in the 1988 amendments would have been superfluous had Congress assumed that disparate-impact liability did not exist under the FHA.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Recognition of disparate-impact claims is also consistent with the central purpose of the FHA, which, like Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.  Suits targeting unlawful zoning laws and other housing restrictions that unfairly exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without sufficient justification are at the heartland of disparate-impact liability.  See, <i>e.g., Huntington</i> v. <i>Huntington Branch, NAACP</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15\n\xe2\x80\x9318.  Recognition of disparate-impact liability under the FHA plays an important role in uncovering discriminatory intent: it permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as disparate treatment.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in key respects to avoid serious constitutional questions that might arise under the FHA, <i>e.g.,</i> if such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of a statistical disparity.  Here, the underlying dispute involves a novel theory of liability that may, on remand, be seen simply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable approaches a housing authority should follow in allocating tax credits for low-income housing.  An important and appropriate means of ensuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give housing authorities and private developers leeway to state and explain the valid interest their policies serve, an analysis that is analogous to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s business necessity standard.  It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapidated housing in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s cities merely because some other priority might seem preferable.  A disparate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s policy or policies causing that disparity.  A robust causality requirement is important in ensuring that defendants do not resort to the use of racial quotas.  Courts must therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie showing of disparate impact, and prompt resolution of these cases is important.  Policies, whether governmental or private, are not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cartificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Griggs, </i>401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431.  Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing decision.  These limitations are also necessary to protect defendants against abusive disparate-impact claims.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">And when courts do find liability under a disparate-impact theory, their remedial orders must be consistent with the Constitution.  Remedial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the elimination of the offending practice, and courts should strive to design race-neutral remedies.  Remedial orders that impose racial targets or quotas might raise difficult constitutional questions.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into public and private transactions covered by the FHA has special dangers, race may be considered in certain circumstances and in a proper fashion.  This Court does not impugn local housing authorities\xe2\x80\x99 race-neutral efforts to encourage revitalization of communities that have long suffered the harsh consequences of segregated housing patterns.  These authorities may choose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation with race-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempting to solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom that endeavor at the outset.

The Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that are distributed to developers through designated state agencies.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742.  Congress has directed States to develop plans identifying selection criteria for distributing the credits.  \xc2\xa742(m)(1).  Those plans must include certain criteria, such as public housing waiting lists, \xc2\xa742(m)(1)(C), as well as certain preferences, including that low-income housing units \xe2\x80\x9ccontribut[e] to a concerted community revitalization plan\xe2\x80\x9d and be built in census tracts populated predominantly by low-income residents.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa742(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), 42(d)(5)(ii)(I).  Federal law thus favors the distribution of these tax credits for the development of housing units in low-income areas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the State of Texas these federal credits are distrib-uted by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department).  Under Texas law, a developer\xe2\x80\x99s application for the tax credits is scored under a point system that gives priority to statutory criteria, such as the financial feasibility of the development project and the income level of tenants.  Tex. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72306.6710(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) (West 2008).  The Texas Attorney General has interpreted state law to permit the consideration of additional criteria, such as whether the housing units will be built in a neighborhood with good schools.  Those criteria cannot be awarded more points than statutorily mandated criteria.  Tex. Op. Atty.  Gen. No. GA\xe2\x80\x930208, pp. 2\xe2\x80\x936 (2004), 2004 WL 1434796, *4\xe2\x80\x93*6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), is a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing.  In 2008, the ICP brought this suit against the Department and its officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  As relevant here, it brought a disparate-impact claim under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA.  The ICP alleged the Department has caused continued segregated housing patterns by its disproportionate allocation of the tax credits, granting too many credits for housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods.  The ICP contended that the Department must modify its selection criteria in order to encourage the construction of low-income housing in suburban communities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima facie case of disparate impact.  It relied on two pieces of statistical evidence.  First, it found \xe2\x80\x9cfrom 1999\xe2\x80\x932008, [the Department] approved tax credits for 49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only approved 37.4% of proposed non-elderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  749 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 486, 499 (ND Tex. 2010) (footnote omitted).  Second, it found \xe2\x80\x9c92.29% of [low-income housing tax credit] units in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts with less than 50% Caucasian residents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court then placed the burden on the Department to rebut the ICP\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie showing of disparate impact.  860 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 312, 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (2012).  After assuming the Department\xe2\x80\x99s proffered interests were legitimate, <i>id.</i>, at 326, the District Court held that a defendant\xe2\x80\x94here the Department\xe2\x80\x94must prove \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are no other less discriminatory alternatives to advancing their proffered interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  Because, in its view, the Department \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to meet [its] burden of proving that there are no less discriminatory alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court ruled for the ICP.  <i>Id.</i>, at 331.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial order required the addition of new selection criteria for the tax credits.  For instance, it awarded points for units built in neighborhoods with good schools and disqualified sites that are located adjacent to or near hazardous conditions, such as high crime areas or landfills.  See 2012 WL 3201401 (Aug. 7, 2012).  The remedial order contained no explicit racial targets or quotas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the Department\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability.  See Implementation of the Fair Housing Act\xe2\x80\x99s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 (2013).  The regulation also established a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating disparate-impact claims.  Under the regulation, a plaintiff first must make a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  That is, the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9chas the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  24 CFR \xc2\xa7100.500(c)(1) (2014).  If a statistical discrepancy is caused by factors other than the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s policy, a plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and there is no liability.  After a plaintiff does establish a prima facie showing of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to \xe2\x80\x9cprov[e] that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7100.500(c)(2).  HUD has clarified that this step of the analysis \xe2\x80\x9cis analogous to the Title VII requirement that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s interest in an employment practice with a disparate impact be job related.\xe2\x80\x9d  78 Fed. Reg. 11470.  Once a defendant has satisfied its burden at step two, a plaintiff may \xe2\x80\x9cprevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7100.500(c)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, consistent with its precedent, that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA.  747 F.\xc2\xa03d 275, 280 (2014).  On the merits, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Relying on HUD\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, the Court of Appeals held that it was improper for the District Court to have placed the burden on the Department to prove there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating low-income housing tax credits.  <i>Id</i>., at 282\xe2\x80\x93283.  In a concurring opinion, Judge Jones stated that on remand the District Court should reexamine whether the ICP had made out a prima facie case of disparate impact.  She suggested the District Court incorrectly relied on bare statistical evidence without engaging in any analysis about causation.  She further observed that, if the fed-eral law providing for the distribution of low-income housing tax credits ties the Department\xe2\x80\x99s hands to such an extent that it lacks a meaningful choice, then there is no disparate-impact liability.  See <i>id.</i>, at 283\xe2\x80\x93284 (specially concurring opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Department filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on the question whether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA.  The question was one of first impression, see <i>Huntington </i>v. <i>Huntington Branch, NAACP</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15 (1988)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), and certiorari followed, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  It is now appropriate to provide a brief history of the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and its later amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>De\xc2\xa0jure</i> residential segregation by race was declared unconstitutional almost a century ago, <i>Buchanan</i> v. <i>Warley</i>,\n\n245 U. S. 60 (1917)\n, but its vestiges remain today, intertwined with the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic and social life.  Some segregated housing patterns can be traced to conditions that arose in the mid-20th century.  Rapid urbanization, concomitant with the rise of suburban developments accessible by car, led many white families to leave the inner cities.  This often left minority families concentrated in the center of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s cities.  During this time, various practices were followed, sometimes with governmental support, to encourage and maintain the separation of the races: Racially restrictive covenants prevented the conveyance of property to minorities, see <i>Shelley </i>v. <i>Krae-mer</i>,\n\n334 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1948)\n; steering by real-estate agents led potential buyers to consider homes in racially homogenous areas; and discriminatory lending practices, often referred to as redlining, precluded minority families from purchasing homes in affluent areas.  See, <i>e.g., </i>M. Klarman, Unfinished Business: Racial Equality in American History 140\xe2\x80\x93141 (2007); Brief for Housing Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 22\xe2\x80\x9323.<i> </i>By the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, these policies, practices, and prejudices had created many predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs.  See K. Clark, Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power 11, 21\xe2\x80\x9326 (1965).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The mid-1960\xe2\x80\x99s was a period of considerable social unrest; and, in response, President Lyndon Johnson established the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission.  Exec. Order No. 11365, 3 CFR 674 (1966\xe2\x80\x931970 Comp.).  After extensive factfinding the Commission identified residential segregation and unequal housing and economic conditions in the inner cities as significant, underlying causes of the social unrest.  See Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 91 (1968) (Kerner Commission Report).  The Commission found that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]early two-thirds of all nonwhite families living in the central cities today live in neighborhoods marked by substandard housing and general urban blight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 13.  The Commission further found that both open and covert racial discrimination prevented black families from obtaining better housing and moving to integrated communities.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Commission concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white\xe2\x80\x94separate and unequal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1.  To reverse \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his deepening racial division,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, it recommended enactment of \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive and enforceable open-occupancy law making it an offense to discriminate in the sale or rental of any housing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 263.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Nation faced a new urgency to resolve the social unrest in the inner cities.  Congress responded by adopting the Kerner Commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation and passing the Fair Housing Act.  The statute addressed the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Civil Rights Act of 1968, \xc2\xa7804,\n\n82Stat.\n83.  Then, in 1988, Congress amended the FHA.  Among other provisions, it created certain exemptions from liability and added \xe2\x80\x9cfamilial status\xe2\x80\x9d as a protected characteristic.  See Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,\n\n102Stat.\n1619.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The issue here is whether, under a proper interpretation of the FHA, housing decisions with a disparate impact are prohibited.  Before turning to the FHA, however, it is necessary to consider two other antidiscrimination statutes that preceded it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first relevant statute is \xc2\xa7703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n78Stat.\n255.  The Court addressed the concept of disparate impact under this statute in <i>Griggs</i> v. <i>Duke Power Co.</i>,\n\n401 U. S. 424 (1971)\n.  There, the employer had a policy requiring its manual laborers to possess a high school diploma and to obtain satisfactory scores on two intelligence tests.  The Court of Appeals held the employer had not adopted these job requirements for a racially discriminatory purpose, and the plaintiffs did not challenge that holding in this Court.  Instead, the plaintiffs argued \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) covers the discriminatory effect of a practice as well as the motivation behind the practice.  Section 703(a), as amended, provides as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employer practice for an employer\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court did not quote or cite the full statute, but rather relied solely on \xc2\xa7703(a)(2).  <i>Griggs</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 426, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In interpreting \xc2\xa7703(a)(2), the Court reasoned that disparate-impact liability furthered the purpose and design of the statute.  The Court explained that, in \xc2\xa7703(a)(2), Congress \xe2\x80\x9cproscribe[d] not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 431.  For that reason, as the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress directed the thrust of [\xc2\xa7703(a)(2)] to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 432.  In light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s goal of achieving \xe2\x80\x9cequality of employment opportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated in the past\xe2\x80\x9d to favor some races over others, the Court held \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of Title VII must be interpreted to allow disparate-impact claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court put important limits on its holding: namely, not all employment practices causing a disparate impact impose liability under \xc2\xa7703(a)(2).  In this respect, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes a defense to disparate-impact claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 431.  This rule provides, for example, that in a disparate-impact case, \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) does not prohibit hiring criteria with a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest relationship\xe2\x80\x9d to job performance.  <i>Id.,</i> at 432; see also <i>Ricci</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 587\xe2\x80\x93589 (emphasizing the importance of the business necessity defense to disparate-impact liability).  On the facts before it, the Court in <i>Griggs</i> found a violation of Title VII because the employer could not establish that high school diplomas and general intelligence tests were related to the job performance of its manual laborers.  See 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431\xe2\x80\x93432.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second relevant statute that bears on the proper interpretation of the FHA is the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),\n\n81Stat.\n602 <i>et seq.</i>, as amended.  Section 4(a) of the ADEA provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for an employer\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court first addressed whether this provision allows disparate-impact claims in <i>Smith</i> v. <i>City of Jackson</i>,\n\n544 U. S. 228 (2005)\n.  There, a group of older employees challenged their employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give proportionately greater raises to employees with less than five years of experience.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Explaining that <i>Griggs</i> \xe2\x80\x9crepresented the better reading of [Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s] statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 235, a plurality of the Court concluded that the same reasoning pertained to \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA.  The <i>Smith</i> plurality emphasized that both \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of Title VII and \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA contain language \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[ing] such actions that \xe2\x80\x98deprive any individual of employment opportunities or <i>otherwise adversely affect</i> his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 race or age.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 235.  As the plurality observed, the text of these provisions \xe2\x80\x9cfocuses on the <i>effects</i> of the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore compels recognition of disparate-impact liability.  <i>Id.,</i> at 236.  In a separate opinion, Justice Scalia found the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text ambiguous and thus deferred under <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837 (1984)\n, to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulation interpreting the ADEA to imposedisparate-impact liability, see 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 243\xe2\x80\x93247 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Together, <i>Griggs</i> holds and the plurality in <i>Smith</i> instructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory purpose.  These cases also teach that disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and other regulated entities are able to make the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free-enterprise system.  And before rejecting a business justification\xe2\x80\x94or, in the case of a governmental entity, an analogous public interest\xe2\x80\x94a court must determine that a plaintiff has shown that there is \xe2\x80\x9can available alternative .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. practice that has less disparate impact and serves the [entity\xe2\x80\x99s] legitimate needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ricci</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 578.  The cases interpreting Title VII and the ADEA provide essential background and instruction in the case now before the Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Turning to the FHA, the ICP relies on two provisions.  Section 804(a) provides that it shall be unlawful:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cTo refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale orrental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73604(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise make unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d is of central importance to the analysis that follows.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 805(a), in turn, provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73605(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applied here, the logic of <i>Griggs</i> and <i>Smith</i> provides strong support for the conclusion that the FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise make unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the consequences of an action rather than the actor\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Giles</i>,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n48 (1937)\n (explaining that the \xe2\x80\x9cword \xe2\x80\x98make\xe2\x80\x99 has many meanings, among them \xe2\x80\x98[t]o cause to exist, appear or occur\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1934))).  This results-oriented language counsels in favor of recognizing disparate-impact liability.  See <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 236.  The Court has construed statutory language similar to \xc2\xa7805(a) to include disparate-impact liability.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New York </i>v. <i>Harris</i>,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130\n\xe2\x80\x93141 (1979) (holding the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d encompassed disparate-impact liability in the context of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, purpose, and structure).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A comparison to the antidiscrimination statutes examined in <i>Griggs</i> and <i>Smith</i> is useful.  Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s and the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise adversely affect\xe2\x80\x9d language is equivalent in function and purpose to the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise make unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d language.  In these three statutes the operative text looks to results.  The relevant statutory phrases, moreover, play an identical role in the structure common to all three statutes: Located at the end of lengthy sentences that begin with prohibitions on disparate treatment, they serve as catchall phrases looking to consequences, not intent.  And all three statutes use the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d to introduce the results-oriented phrase.  \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cin a different way or manner,\xe2\x80\x9d thus signaling a shift in emphasis from an actor\xe2\x80\x99s intent to the consequences of his actions.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1598 (1971).  This similarity in text and structure is all the more compelling given that Congress passed the FHA in 1968\xe2\x80\x94only four years after passing Title VII and only four months after enacting the ADEA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that Congress did not reiterate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s exact language in the FHA, but that is because to do so would have made the relevant sentence awkward and unclear.  A provision making it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9crefuse to sell[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or otherwise [adversely affect], a dwelling to any person\xe2\x80\x9d because of a protected trait would be grammatically obtuse, difficult to interpret, and far more expansive in scope than Congress likely intended.  Congress thus chose words that serve the same purpose and bear the same basic meaning but are consistent with the structure and objectives of the FHA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Emphasizing that the FHA uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of race,\xe2\x80\x9d the Department argues this language forecloses disparate-impact liability since \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n action is not taken \xe2\x80\x98because of race\xe2\x80\x99 unless race is a <i>reason</i> for the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 26.  <i>Griggs</i> and <i>Smith</i>, however, dispose of this argument.  Both Title VII and the ADEA contain identical \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d language, see\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(2);\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(2), and the Courtnonetheless held those statutes impose disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, it is of crucial importance that the existence of disparate-impact liability is supported by amendments to the FHA that Congress enacted in 1988.  By that time, all nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question had concluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-impact claims.  See <i>Huntington Branch, NAACP</i> v.<i>Huntington</i>, 844 F.\xc2\xa02d 926, 935\xe2\x80\x93936 (CA2 1988); <i>Resident Advisory Bd. </i>v. <i>Rizzo</i>, 564 F.\xc2\xa02d 126, 146 (CA3 1977); <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Clarkton</i>, 682 F.\xc2\xa02d 1055, 1065 (CA4 1982); <i>Hanson </i>v. <i>Veterans Administration</i>, 800 F.\xc2\xa02d 1381, 1386 (CA5 1986); <i>Arthur </i>v. <i>Toledo</i>, 782 F.\xc2\xa02d 565, 574\xe2\x80\x93575 (CA6 1986); <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. </i>v. <i>Arlington Heights</i>, 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 1283, 1290 (CA7 1977); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Black Jack</i>, 508 F.\xc2\xa02d 1179, 1184\xe2\x80\x931185 (CA8 1974); <i>Halet </i>v. <i>Wend Investment Co.</i>, 672 F.\xc2\xa02d 1305, 1311 (CA9 1982); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Marengo Cty</i>.<i> Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 731 F.\xc2\xa02d 1546, 1559, n.\xc2\xa020 (CA11 1984).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When it amended the FHA, Congress was aware of this unanimous precedent.  And with that understanding, it made a considered judgment to retain the relevant statutory text.  See H. R. Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93711, p.\xc2\xa021, n. 52 (1988) (H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.) (discussing suits premised on disparate-impact claims and related judicial precedent); 134 Cong. Rec. 23711 (1988) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (noting unanimity of Federal Courts of Appeals concerning disparate impact); Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987: Hearings on S. 558 before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 529 (1987) (testimony of Professor Robert Schwemm) (describing consensus judicial view that the FHA imposed disparate-impact liability).  Indeed, Congress rejected a proposed amendment that would have eliminated disparate-impact liability for certain zoning decisions.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 89\xe2\x80\x9393.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Against this background understanding in the legal and regulatory system, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision in 1988 to amend the FHA while still adhering to the operative language in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7804(a) and 805(a) is convincing support for the conclusion that Congress accepted and ratified the unanimous holdings of the Courts of Appeals finding disparate-impact liability.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf a word or phrase has been .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. given a uniform interpretation by inferior courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0, a later version of that act perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry forward that interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012); see also <i>Forest Grove School Dist.</i> v.\xc2\xa0<i>T.</i>\xc2\xa0<i>A.</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 230,\n244, n.\n11 (2009)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress amended [the Act] without altering the text of [the relevant provision], it implicitly adopted [this Court\xe2\x80\x99s] construction of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Manhattan Properties, Inc.</i> v. <i>Irving Trust Co.</i>,\n\n291 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n336 (1934)\n (explaining, where the Courts of Appeals had reached a consensus interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act and Congress had amended the Act without changing the relevant provision, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his is persua-sive that the construction adopted by the [lower federal] courts has been acceptable to the legislative arm of the government\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further and convincing confirmation of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that disparate-impact liability exists under the FHA is revealed by the substance of the 1988 amendments.  The amendments included three exemptions from liability that assume the existence of disparate-impact claims.  The most logical conclusion is that the three amendments were deemed necessary because Congress presupposed disparate impact under the FHA as it had been enacted in 1968.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The relevant 1988 amendments were as follows.  First, Congress added a clarifying provision: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in [the FHA] prohibits a person engaged in the business of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration factors other than race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa73605(c).  Second, Congress provided: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in [the FHA] prohibits conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73607(b)(4).  And finally, Congress specified: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in [the FHA] limits the applicability of any reasonable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73607(b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The exemptions embodied in these amendments would be superfluous if Congress had assumed that disparate-impact liability did not exist under the FHA.  See <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,\n574 (1995)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court will avoid a reading which renders some words altogether redundant\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, none of these amendments would make sense if the FHA encompassed only disparate-treatment claims.  If that were the sole ground for liability, the amendments merely restate black-letter law.  If an actor makes a decision based on reasons other than a protected category, there is no disparate-treatment liability.  See, <i>e.g., Texas Dept. of Community Affairs</i> v. <i>Burdine</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 248,\n254 (1981)\n.  But the amendments do constrain disparate-impact liability.  For instance, certain criminal convictions are correlated with sex and race.  See, <i>e.g., Kimbrough </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85,\n98 (2007)\n (discussing the racial disparity in convictions for crack cocaine offenses).  By adding an exemption from liability for exclusionary practices aimed at individuals with drug convictions, Congress ensured disparate-impact liability would not lie if a landlord excluded tenants with such convictions.  The same is true of the provision allowing for reasonable restrictions on occupancy.  And the exemption from liability for real-estate appraisers is in the same section as \xc2\xa7805(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of discriminatory practices in real-estate transactions, thus indicating Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition that disparate-impact liability arose under \xc2\xa7805(a).  In short, the 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A comparison to <i>Smith</i>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the ADEA further demonstrates why the Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would render the 1988 amendments superfluous.  Under the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-factor-other-than-age (RFOA) provision, an employer is permitted to take an otherwise prohibited action where \xe2\x80\x9cthe differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7623(f\xc2\xa0)(1).  In other words, if an employer makes a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age, it cannot be said to have made a decision on the basis of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s age.  According to the <i>Smith</i> plurality, the RFOA provision \xe2\x80\x9cplays its principal role\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin cases involving disparate-impact claims\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cby precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was \xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 239.  The plurality thus reasoned that the RFOA provision would be \xe2\x80\x9csimply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA\xe2\x80\x9d if liability were limited to disparate-treatment claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 238.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A similar logic applies here.  If a real-estate appraiser took into account a neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s schools, one could not say the appraiser acted because of race.  And by embedding\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73605(c)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption in the statutory text, Congress ensured that disparate-impact liability would not be allowed either.  Indeed, the inference of disparate-impact liability is even stronger here than it was in <i>Smith</i>.  As originally enacted, the ADEA included the RFOA provision, see \xc2\xa74(f)(1),\n\n81Stat.\n603, whereas here Congress added the relevant exemptions in the 1988 amendments against the backdrop of the uniform view of the Courts of Appeals that the FHA imposed disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Recognition of disparate-impact claims is consistent with the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s central purpose.  See <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 235 (plurality opinion); <i>Griggs</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 432.  The FHA, like Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.  See\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73601 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); H. R. Rep., at 15 (explaining the FHA \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a clear national policy against discrimination in housing\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These unlawful practices include zoning laws and other housing restrictions that function unfairly to exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without any sufficient justification.  Suits targeting such practices reside at the heartland of disparate-impact liability.  See, <i>e.g., Huntington</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (invalidating zoning law preventing construction of multifamily rental units);<i> Black Jack</i>, 508 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1182\xe2\x80\x931188 (invalidating ordinance prohibiting construction of new multifamily dwellings); <i>Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center</i> v. <i>St. Bernard Parish</i>, 641 F. Supp. 2d 563, 569, 577\xe2\x80\x93578 (ED La. 2009) (invalidating post-Hurricane Katrina ordinance restricting the rental of housing units to only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blood relative[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in an area of the city that was 88.3% white and 7.6% black); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\xe2\x80\x9353 (discussing these cases).  The availability of disparate-impact liability, furthermore, has allowed private developers to vindicate the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives and to protect their prop-erty rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbi-trary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring the construction of certain types of housing units.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Huntington</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 18.  Recognition of disparate-impact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncovering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as disparate treatment.  In this way disparate-impact liability may prevent segregated housing patterns that might otherwise result from covert and illicit stereotyping.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in key respects that avoid the serious constitutional questions that might arise under the FHA, for instance,if such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of a statistical disparity.  Disparate-impact liability mandates the \xe2\x80\x9cremoval of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers,\xe2\x80\x9d not the displacement of valid governmental policies.  <i>Griggs</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 431.  The FHA is not an instrument to force housing authorities to reorder their priorities.  Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those priorities can be achieved without arbitrarily creating discriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the heartland of disparate-impact suits targeting artificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in this case involves a novel theory of liability.  See Seicsh-naydre, Is Disparate Impact Having Any Impact? An Appellate Analysis of Forty Years of Disparate Impact Claims Under the Fair Housing Act, 63 Am. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 357, 360\xe2\x80\x93363 (2013) (noting the rarity of this type of claim).  This case, on remand, may be seen simply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable approaches a housing authority should follow in the sound exercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for low-income housing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An important and appropriate means of ensuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give housing authorities and private developers leeway to state and explain the valid interest served by their policies.  This step of the analysis is analogous to the business necessity standard under Title VII and provides a defense against disparate-impact liability.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 11470 (explaining that HUD did not use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d because that \xe2\x80\x9cphrase may not be easily understood to cover the full scope of practices covered by the Fair Housing Act, which applies to individuals, busi-nesses, nonprofit organizations, and public entities\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court explained in <i>Ricci</i>, an entity \xe2\x80\x9ccould be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the [challenged practices] were not job related and consistent with business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 587.  Just as an employer may maintain a workplace requirement that causes a disparate impact if that requirement is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable measure[ment] of job performance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Griggs</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 436, so too must housing authorities and private developers be allowed to maintain a policy if they can prove it is necessary to achieve a valid interest.  To be sure, the Title VII framework may not transfer exactly to the fair-housing context, but the comparison suffices for present purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapidated housing in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s cities merely because some other priority might seem preferable.  Entrepreneurs must be given latitude to consider market factors.  Zoning officials, moreover, must often make decisions based on a mix of factors, both objective (such as cost and traffic patterns) and, at least to some extent, subjective (such as preserving historic architecture).  These factors contribute to a community\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life and are legitimate concerns for housing authorities.  The FHA does not decree a particular vision of urban development; and it does not put housing authorities and private developers in a double bind of liability, subject to suit whether they choose to rejuvenate a city core or to promote new low-income housing in suburban communities.  As HUD itself recognized in its recent rulemaking, disparate-impact liability \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mandate that affordable housing be located in neighborhoods with any particular characteristic.\xe2\x80\x9d  78 Fed. Reg. 11476.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a similar vein, a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s policy or policies causing that disparity.  A robust causality requirement ensures that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]acial imbalance . . . does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d and thus protects defendants from being held liable for racial disparities they did not create.<i>  Wards Cove Packing Co.</i> v. <i>Atonio</i>,\n\n490 U. S. 642,\n653 (1989)\n, superseded by statute on other grounds,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k).  Without adequate safeguards at the prima facie stage, disparate-impact liability might cause race to be used and considered in a pervasive way and \xe2\x80\x9cwould almost inexorably lead\xe2\x80\x9d governmental or private entities to use \xe2\x80\x9cnumerical quotas,\xe2\x80\x9d and serious constitutional questions then could arise.  490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 653<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The litigation at issue here provides an example.  From the standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage to racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general matter that a decision to build low-income housing in a blighted inner-city neighborhood instead of a suburb is discriminatory, or vice versa.  If those sorts of judgments are subject to challenge without adequate safeguards, then there is a danger that potential defendants may adopt racial quotas\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance that itself raises serious constitutional concerns.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Courts must therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate impact and prompt resolution of these cases is important.    A plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal connection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate impact.  For instance, a plaintiff challenging the decision of a private developer to construct a new building in one location rather than another will not easily be able to show this is a policy causing a disparate impact because such a one-time decision may not be a policy at all.  It may also be difficult to establish causation because of the multiple factors that go into investment decisions about where to construct or renovate housing units.  And as Judge Jones observed below, if the ICP cannot show a causal connection between the Department\xe2\x80\x99s policy and a disparate impact\xe2\x80\x94for instance, because federal law substantially limits the Department\xe2\x80\x99s discretion\xe2\x80\x94that should resultin dismissal of this case.  747 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 283\xe2\x80\x93284 (specially concurring opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FHA imposes a command with respect to disparate-impact liability.  Here, that command goes to a state entity.  In other cases, the command will go to a private person or entity.  Governmental or private policies are not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cartificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Griggs</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431.  Difficult questions might arise if disparate-impact liability under the FHA caused race to be used and considered in a pervasive and explicit manner to justify governmental or private actions that, in fact, tend to perpetuate race-based considerations rather than move beyond them.  Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The limitations on disparate-impact liability discussed here are also necessary to protect potential defendants against abusive disparate-impact claims.  If the specter of disparate-impact litigation causes private developers to no longer construct or renovate housing units for low-income individuals, then the FHA would have undermined its own purpose as well as the free-market system.  And as to governmental entities, they must not be prevented from achieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compliance with health and safety codes.  The Department\xe2\x80\x99s <i>amici</i>, in addition to the well-stated principal dissenting opinion in this case, see <i>post</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (opinion of Alito, J.), call attention to the decision by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <i>Gallagher </i>v. <i>Magner</i>, 619 F.\xc2\xa03d 823 (2010).  Although the Court is reluctant to approve or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should be noted that <i>Magner</i> was decided without the cautionary standards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the case was settled by the parties before an ultimate determination of disparate-impact liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Were standards for proceeding with disparate-impact suits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed here, then disparate-impact liability might displace valid governmental and private priorities, rather than solely \xe2\x80\x9cremov[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Griggs</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431.  And that, in turn, would set our Nation back in its quest to reduce the salience of race in our social and economic system.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It must be noted further that, even when courts do find liability under a disparate-impact theory, their remedial orders must be consistent with the Constitution.  Remedial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate onthe elimination of the offending practice that \xe2\x80\x9carbitrar[ily] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. operate[s] invidiously to discriminate on the basis of rac[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  If additional measures are adopted, courts should strive to design them to eliminate racial disparities through race-neutral means.  See <i>Richmond </i>v. <i>J.</i>\xc2\xa0<i>A. Croson Co.</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469,\n510 (1989)\n (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he city has at its disposal a whole array of race-neutral devices to increase the accessibility of city contracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races\xe2\x80\x9d).  Remedial orders that impose racial targets or quotas might raise more difficult constitutional questions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into public and private transactions covered by the FHA has special dangers, it is also true that race may be considered in certain circumstances and in a proper fashion.  Cf. <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools </i>v<i>. Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701,\n789 (2007)\n (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cSchool boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; [and] drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just as this Court has not \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[ed] an employer\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative efforts to ensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for promotions and to participate in the [promotion] process,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ricci</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 585, it likewise does not impugn housing authorities\xe2\x80\x99 race-neutral efforts to encourage revitalization of communities that have long suffered the harsh consequences of segregated housing patterns.  When setting their larger goals, local housing authorities may choose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation with race-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempting to solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom that endeavor at the outset.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court holds that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act upon considering its results-oriented language, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar language in Title VII and the ADEA, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ratification of disparate-impact claims in 1988 against the backdrop of the unanimous view of nine Courts of Appeals, and the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In light of the longstanding judicial interpretation of the FHA to encompass disparate-impact claims and congressional reaffirmation of that result, residents and policymakers have come to rely on the availability of disparate-impact claims.  See Brief for Massachusetts et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cWithout disparate impact claims, States and others will be left with fewer crucial tools to combat the kinds of systemic discrimination that the FHA was intended to address\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, many of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities\xe2\x80\x94entities that are potential defendants in disparate-impact suits\xe2\x80\x94have submitted an <i>amicus</i> brief in this case supporting disparate-impact liability under the FHA.  See Brief for City of San Francisco et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3\xe2\x80\x936.

But since the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968 and against the backdrop of disparate-impact liability in nearly every jurisdiction, many cities have become more diverse.  The FHA must play an important part in avoiding the Kerner Commission\xe2\x80\x99s grim prophecy that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white\xe2\x80\x94separate and un-equal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kerner Commission Report 1.

Even so, it concluded that the city\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caggressive enforcement of the Housing Code\xe2\x80\x9d was actionable because making landlords respond to \xe2\x80\x9crodent infestation, missing dead-bolt locks, inadequate sanitation facilities, inadequate heat, inoperable smoke detectors, broken or missing doors,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like increased the price of rent.  <i>Id.,</i> at 830, 835.

Treating someone \xe2\x80\x9cless favorably than others because of a protected trait\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the most easily understood type of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557,\n577 (2009)\n (quoting <i>Teamsters</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 324\n, n.\xc2\xa015 (1977); some internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, this classic form of discrimination\xe2\x80\x94called disparate treatment\xe2\x80\x94is the only one prohibited by the Constitution itself.  See, <i>e.g., Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252\n\xe2\x80\x93265 (1977).

The answer is equally clear.  The FHA does not authorize disparate-impact claims.  No such liability was created when the law was enacted in 1968.

But the critical language in this section\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is identical to the critical language in the sections at issue in this case.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne ordinarily assumes\xe2\x80\x9d Congress means the same words in the same statute to mean the same thing.  <i>Utility Air Regulatory Group</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 15).  There is no reason to doubt that ordinary assumption here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Like the FHA, many other federal statutes use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d to signify what that phrase means in ordinary speech.  For instance, the federal hate crime statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7249, authorizes enhanced sentences for defendants convicted of committing certain crimes \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d race, color, religion, or other listed characteristics.  Hate crimes require bad intent\xe2\x80\x94indeed, that is the whole point of these laws.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Mitchell</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476\n\xe2\x80\x93485 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is selected because of his race or other protected status\xe2\x80\x9d).  All of this confirms that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d in the FHA should be read to mean what it says.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In an effort to find at least a sliver of support for disparate-impact liability in the text of the FHA, the principalrespondent, the Solicitor General, and the Court pounce on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmake unavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa7804(a), it is unlawful \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. make unavailable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73604(a).

The Solicitor General argues that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he plain meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x98make unavailable\xe2\x80\x99 includes actions that <i>have the result</i> of making housing or transactions unavailable, regardless of whether the actions were intended to have that result.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18 (emphasis added).  This argument is not consistent with ordinary English usage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is doubtful that the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s argument accurately captures the \xe2\x80\x9cplain meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmake unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d even when that phrase is not linked to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]ake unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d must be viewed together with the rest of the actions covered by \xc2\xa7804(a), which applies when a party \xe2\x80\x9c<i>refuse[s]</i> to sell or rent\xe2\x80\x9d a dwelling, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>refuse[s]</i> to negotiate for the sale or rental\xe2\x80\x9d of a dwelling, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>den[ies]</i> a dwelling to any person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise <i>make[s]</i> <i>unavailable</i>\xe2\x80\x9d a dwelling.  \xc2\xa73604(a) (emphasis added).  When a statute contains a list like this, we \xe2\x80\x9cavoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving \xe2\x80\x98unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gustafson </i>v.<i> Alloyd Co.,</i>\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,\n575 (1995)\n (quoting <i>Jarecki </i>v.<i> G.

See also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 14); <i>id</i>., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  Here, the phrases that precede \xe2\x80\x9cmake unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d unmistakably describe <i>intentional</i> deprivations of equal treatment, not merely actions that happen to have a disparate effect.  See <i>American Ins. Assn.,</i> ___ F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at ___, 2014 WL 5802283, at *8 (citing Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 603, 848, 1363, 1910 (1966)).  Section 804(a), moreover, prefaces \xe2\x80\x9cmake unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d thus creating a catchall.  Catchalls must be read \xe2\x80\x9crestrictively\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d the listed terms.  <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</i> v. <i>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371\n\xe2\x80\x93385 (2003).  The result of these ordinary rules of interpretation is that even without \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of,\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmake unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d likely would require intentionality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FHA\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of,\xe2\x80\x9d however, removes any doubt.  Sections 804(a) and 805(a) apply only when a party makes a dwelling or transaction unavailable \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d race or another protected characteristic.  In ordinary English usage, when a person makes something unavailable \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d some factor, that factor must be a reason for the act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here is an example.  Suppose that Congress increases the minimum wage.  Some economists believe that such legislation reduces the number of jobs available for \xe2\x80\x9cunskilled workers,\xe2\x80\x9d Fuller &amp; Geide-Stevenson, Consensus Among Economists: Revisited, 34 J. Econ. Educ. 369, 378 (2003), and minorities tend to be disproportionately represented in this group, see, <i>e.g., </i>Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Detailed Years of School Completed by People 25 Years and Over by Sex, Age Groups, Race and Hispanic Origin: 2014, online at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html (all Inter-net materials as visited June 23, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Assuming for the sake of argument that these economists are correct, would it be fair to say that Congress made jobs unavailable to African-Americans or Latinos \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d their race or ethnicity?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A second example.  Of the 32 college players selected by National Football League (NFL) teams in the first round of the 2015 draft, it appears that the overwhelming majority were members of racial minorities.  See Draft 2015, http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015.  See also Miller, Powerful Sports Agents Representing Color, Los Angeles Sentinel, Feb. 6, 2014, p. B3 (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthere are 96 players (76 of whom are African-American) chosen in the first rounds of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 NFL drafts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Teams presumably chose the players they think are most likely to help them win games.  Would anyone say the NFL teams made draft slots unavailable to white players \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d their race?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A third example.  During the present Court Term, of the 21 attorneys from the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s Office who argued cases in this Court, it appears that all but 5 (76%) were under the age of 45.  Would the Solicitor General say he made argument opportunities unavailable to older attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d their age?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the FHA simply cannot be twisted to authorize disparate-impact claims.  It is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly stated that the FHA prohibits only intentional discrimination than by forbidding acts done \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The circumstances in which the FHA was enacted only confirm what the text says.  In 1968, \xe2\x80\x9cthe predominant focus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Smith</i> v. <i>City of Jackson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228,\n258 (2005)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The very \xe2\x80\x9cconcept of disparate impact liability, by contrast, was quite novel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(collecting citations).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cJustice Ginsburg: .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be realistic about this, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act passed, nobody knew anything about disparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is anachronistic to think that Congress authorized disparate-impact claims in 1968 but packaged that striking innovation so imperceptibly in the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Eradicating intentional discrimination was and is the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for providing fair housing opportunities for all.  The Court recalls the country\xe2\x80\x99s shameful history of segregation and <i>de jure</i> housing discrimination and then jumps to the conclusion that the FHA authorized disparate-impact claims as a method of combatting that evil.<i>Ante</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  But the fact that the 1968 Congress sought to end housing discrimination says nothing about the means it devised to achieve that end.  The FHA\xe2\x80\x99s text plainly identifies the weapon Congress chose\xe2\x80\x94outlawing disparate treatment \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of race\xe2\x80\x9d or another protected characteristic.   42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73604(a), 3605(a).  Accordingly, in any FHA claim, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roof of discriminatory motive is critical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Teamsters</i>, 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 335, n.\xc2\xa015.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Congress has done nothing since 1968 to change the meaning of the FHA prohibitions at issue in this case.  In 1968, those prohibitions forbade certain housing practices if they were done \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d protected characteristics.  Today, they still forbid certain housing practices if done \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d protected characteristics.  The meaning of the unaltered language adopted in 1968 has not evolved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather than confronting the plain text of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7804(a) and 805(a), the Solicitor General and the Court place heavy reliance on certain amendments enacted in 1988, but those amendments did not modify the meaning of the provisions now before us.  In the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,\n\n102Stat.\n1619, Congress expanded the list of protected characteristics.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73604(a), (f\xc2\xa0)(1).  Congress also gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rulemaking authority and the power to adjudicate certain housing claims.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73612, 3614a.  And, what is most relevant for present purposes, Congress added three safe-harbor provisions, specifying that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in [the FHA]\xe2\x80\x9d prohibits (a) certain actions taken by real property appraisers, (b) certain occupancy requirements, and (c) the treatment of persons convicted of manufacturing or distributing illegal drugs.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the Solicitor General and the Court, these amendments show that the FHA authorizes disparate-impact claims.  Indeed, the Court says that they are \xe2\x80\x9cof crucial importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13.  This \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial\xe2\x80\x9d argument, however, cannot stand.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Solicitor General and the Court contend that the 1988 Congress implicitly authorized disparate-impact liability by adopting the amendments just noted while leaving the operative provisions of the FHA untouched.  Congress knew at that time, they maintain, that the Courts of Appeals had held that the FHA sanctionsdisparate-impact claims, but Congress failed to enact bills that would have rejected that theory of liability.  Based on this, they submit that Congress silently ratified those decisions.  See <i>ante</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  This argument is deeply flawed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> Not the greatest of its defects is its assessment of what Congress must have known about the judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the FHA.  The Court writes that by 1988, \xe2\x80\x9call nine <i>Courts of Appeals</i> to have addressed the question had concluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-impact claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (emphasis added).  See also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12.  But <i>this Court </i>had not addressed that question.  While we always give respectful consideration to interpretations of statutes that garner wide acceptance in other courts, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cno warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other courts have done so,\xe2\x80\x9d even if they have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consistently\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d done so for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9830 years.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Milner</i> v. <i>Department of Navy</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 562\n\xe2\x80\x93576 (2011).

While the Court highlights the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, it fails to mention something that is of at least equal importance: The official view of the United States in 1988.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shortly <i>before</i> the 1988 amendments were adopted, the United States formally argued in this Court that the FHA prohibits only intentional discrimination.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in <i>Huntington </i>v.<i> Huntington Branch, NAACP</i>, O. T. 1988, No. 87\xe2\x80\x931961, p. 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn action taken because of some factor other than race, <i>i.e.,</i> financial means, even if it causes a discriminatory effect, is not an example of the intentional discrimination outlawed by the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 14 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe words \xe2\x80\x98because of\xe2\x80\x99 plainly connote a causal connection between the housing-related action and the person\xe2\x80\x99s race or color\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Thiswas the same position that the United States had taken in lower courts for years.  See, <i>e.g</i>., <i>United States </i>v.<i> Birmingham</i>, 538 F. Supp. 819, 827, n.\xc2\xa09 (ED Mich. 1982) (noting positional change), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 727 F.\xc2\xa02d 560, 565\xe2\x80\x93566 (CA6 1984) (adopting United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconcession\xe2\x80\x9d that there must be a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discriminatory motive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is implausible that the 1988 Congress was aware of certain lower court decisions but oblivious to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 considered and public view that those decisions were wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This fact is fatal to any notion that Congress implicitly ratified disparate impact in 1988.  The canon of interpretation on which the Court and the Solicitor General purport to rely\xe2\x80\x94the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprior-construction canon\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94does not apply where lawyers cannot \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiably regard the point as settled\xe2\x80\x9d or when \xe2\x80\x9cother sound rules of interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d are implicated.  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 324, 325 (2012).  That was the case here.  Especially after the United States began repudiating disparate impact, no one could have reasonably thought that the question was settled.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor can such a faulty argument be salvaged by pointing to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure in 1988 to enact language that would have made it clear that the FHA does not authorizedisparate-impact suits based on zoning decisions.  See <i>ante</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  To change the meaning of language in an already enacted law, Congress must pass a new law amending that language.  See, <i>e.g., West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, and n.\xc2\xa07 (1991).  Intent that finds no expression in a statute is irrelevant.  See, <i>e.g., New York Telephone Co.</i> v. <i>New York State Dept. of Labor</i>,\n\n440 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519\n\xe2\x80\x93545 (1979); Easterbrook, Statutes\xe2\x80\x99 Domains, 50 U. Chi. L.

Hence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Helvering</i> v. <i>Hallock</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106,\n121 (1940)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unsurprisingly, we have rejected <i>identical</i> arguments about implicit ratification in other cases.  For example, in <i>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </i>v.<i> First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,</i>\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164 (1994)\n, a party argued that \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 imposes liability on aiders and abettors because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ha[d] amended the securities laws on various occasions since 1966, when courts first began to interpret \xc2\xa710(b) to cover aiding and abetting, but ha[d] done so without providing that aiding and abetting liability is not available under \xc2\xa710(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 186.  \xe2\x80\x9cFrom that,\xe2\x80\x9d a party asked the Court to \xe2\x80\x9cinfer that these Congresses, by silence, ha[d] acquiesced in the judicial interpretation of \xc2\xa710(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court dismissed this argument in words that apply almost verbatim here:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98It does not follow that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to overturn a statutory precedent is reason for this Court to adhere to it.

Congress may legislate, moreover, only through the passage of a bill which is approved by both Houses and signed by the President.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa77, cl. 2.

As just explained, however, what matters is what Congress <i>did</i>, not what it might have \xe2\x80\x9cassumed.\xe2\x80\x9d  And although the Court characterizes these provisions as \xe2\x80\x9cexemptions,\xe2\x80\x9d that characterization is inaccurate.  They make no reference to \xc2\xa7804(a) or \xc2\xa7805(a) or any other provision of the FHA; nor do they state that they apply to conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.  Instead, they simply make clear that certain conduct is not forbidden by the Act.  <i>E.g., </i>\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73607(b)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this subchapter prohibits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court should read these amendments to mean what they say.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> In 1988, policymakers were not of one mind about disparate-impact housing suits.  Some favored the theory and presumably would have been happy to have it enshrined in the FHA.  See <i>ante</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314; 134 Cong. Rec. 23711 (1988) (statement of Sen. Kennedy).  Others worried about disparate-impact liability and recognized that this Court had not decided whether disparate-impact claims were authorized under the 1968 Act.  See H. R. Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93711, pp.\xc2\xa089\xe2\x80\x9393 (1988).  Still others disapproved of disparate-impact liability and believed that the 1968 Act did not authorize it.  That was the view of President Reagan when he signed the amendments.  See Remarks on Signing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 24 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1140, 1141 (1988) (explaining that the amendments did \xe2\x80\x9cnot represent any congressional or executive branch endorsement of the notion, expressed in some judicial opinions, that [FHA] violations may be established by a showing of disparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d because the FHA \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks only to intentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 1988 safe-harbor provisions have all the hallmarks of a compromise among these factions.  These provisions neither authorize nor bar disparate-impact claims, but they do provide additional protection for persons and entities engaging in certain practices that Congress especially wished to shield.  We \xe2\x80\x9cmust respect and give effect to these sorts of compromises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ragsdale </i>v.<i> Wolverine World Wide, Inc</i>.,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n\xe2\x80\x9394 (2002).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is not hard to see why such a compromise was attractive.  For Members of Congress who supported disparate impact, the safe harbors left the favorable lower court decisions in place.  And for those who hoped that this Court would ultimately agree with the position being urged by the United States, those provisions were not surplusage.  In the Circuits in which disparate-impact FHA liability had been accepted, the safe-harbor provisions furnished a measure of interim protection until the question was resolved by this Court.  They also provided partial protection in the event that this Court ultimately rejected the United States\xe2\x80\x99 argument.  Neither the Court, the principal respondent, nor the Solicitor General has cited any case in which the canon against surplusage has been applied in circumstances like these.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the contrary, we have previously refused to interpret enactments like the 1988 safe-harbor provisions in such a way.  Our decision in <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79 (1996)\n\xe2\x80\x94also ignored by the Court today\xe2\x80\x94is instructive.  In that case, the question was whether a provision of the Internal Revenue Code excluding a recovery for personal injury from gross income applied to punitive damages.  Well after the critical provision was enacted, Congress adopted an amendment providing that punitive damages for nonphysical injuries were not excluded.  Pointing to this amendment, a taxpayer argued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would Congress have enacted this amendment removing punitive damages (in nonphysical injury cases) unless Congress believed that, in the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s absence, punitive damages did fall within the provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 89.  This argument, of course, is precisely the same as the argument made in this case.  To paraphrase <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i>, the Court today asks: Why would Congress have enacted the 1988 amendments, providing safe harbors from three types of disparate-impact claims, unless Congress believed that, in the amendments\xe2\x80\x99 absence, disparate-impact claims did fall within the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court rejected the argument in <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe short answer,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court wrote, is that Congress might have simply wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cclarify the matter in respect to nonphysical injuries\xe2\x80\x9d while otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cleav[ing] the law where it found it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Although other aspects of <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i> triggered a dissent, see <i>id.,</i> at 94\xe2\x80\x93101 (opinion of Scalia, J.), no one quarreled with this self-evident piece of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Nor was the <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i> Court troubled that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 amendment regarding nonphysical injuries turned out to have been unnecessary because punitive damages for any injuries were not excluded all along.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court saw the flaw in the argument in <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i>, and the same argument is no better here.  It is true that <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Gilvie</i> involved a dry question of tax law while this case involves a controversial civil rights issue.  But how we read statutes should not turn on such distinctions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, as the principal respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney candidly admitted, the 1988 amendments did not create disparate-impact liability.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]id the things that [Congress] actually did in 1988 expand the coverage of the Act?  MR. DANIEL: No, Justice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The principal respondent and the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x94but not the Court\xe2\x80\x94have one final argument regarding the text of the FHA.  They maintain that even if the FHA does not unequivocally authorize disparate-impact suits, it is at least ambiguous enough to permit HUD to adopt that interpretation.  Even if the FHA were ambiguous, how-ever, we do not defer \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there is reason to suspect that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation \xe2\x80\x98does not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christopher</i> v. <i>SmithKline Beecham Corp.</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, 43 years after the FHA was enacted and nine days after the Court granted certiorari in <i>Magner </i>(the \xe2\x80\x9crodent infestation\xe2\x80\x9d case), HUD proposed \xe2\x80\x9cto prohibit housing practices with a discriminatory effect, even where there has been no intent to discriminate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Implementation of the Fair Housing Act\xe2\x80\x99s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 76 Fed. Reg. 70921 (2011).  After <i>Magner</i> settled, the Court called for the views of the Solicitor General in <i>Township of Mount Holly</i> v. <i>Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc.,</i> 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), another case raising the same question.  Before the Solicitor General filed his brief, however, HUD adopted disparate-impact regulations.  See Implementation of the Fair Housing Act\xe2\x80\x99s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 (2013).  The Solicitor General then urged HUD\xe2\x80\x99s rule as a reason to deny certiorari.  We granted certiorari anyway, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), and shortly thereafter <i>Mount Holly </i>also<i> </i>unexpectedly settled.  Given this unusual pattern, there is an argument that deference may be unwarranted.  Cf.<i> Young</i> v. <i>United Parcel Service, Inc.</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317) (refusing to defer where \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he EEOC promulgated its 2014 guidelines only recently, after this Court had granted certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d (discussing <i>Skidmore</i> v. <i>Swift &amp; Co.</i>,\n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134,\n140 (1944)\n)).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no need to dwell on these circumstances, however, because deference is inapt for a more familiar reason: The FHA is not ambiguous.  The FHA prohibits only disparate treatment, not disparate impact.  It is a bedrock rule that an agency can never \xe2\x80\x9crewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Utility Air Regulatory Group</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  This rule makes even more sense where the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view would open up a deeply disruptive avenue of liability that Congress never contemplated.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Not only does disparate-impact liability run headlong into the text of the FHA, it also is irreconcilable with our precedents.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today reads far too much into <i>Griggs</i> v. <i>Duke Power Co.</i>,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424 (1971)\n, and far too little into <i>Smith</i> v. <i>City of Jackson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228 (2005)\n.  In <i>Smith</i>, the Court explained that the statutory justification for the decision in <i>Griggs</i> depends on language that has no parallel in the FHA.  And when the <i>Smith</i> Court addressed a provision that does have such a parallel in the FHA, the Court concluded\xe2\x80\x94<i>unanimously</i>\xe2\x80\x94that it does not authorize disparate-impact liability.  The same result should apply here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Rather than focusing on the text of the FHA, much of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning today turns on <i>Griggs</i>.  In <i>Griggs</i>, the Court held that black employees who sued their employer under \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(2), could recover without proving that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94requiring a high school diploma or a qualifying grade on a standardized test as a condition for certain jobs\xe2\x80\x94was motivated by a discriminatory intent.  Instead, the Court held that, unless it was proved that the requirements were \xe2\x80\x9cjob re-lated,\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiffs could recover by showing that the re-quirements \xe2\x80\x9coperated to render ineligible a markedly disproportionate number of Negroes.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Griggs</i> was a case in which an intent to discriminate might well have been inferred.  The company had \xe2\x80\x9copenly discriminated on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x9d prior to the date on which the 1964 Civil Rights Act took effect.  <i>Id</i>., at 427.  Once that date arrived, the company imposed new educational requirements for those wishing to transfer into jobs that were then being performed by white workers who did not meet those requirements.  <i>Id</i>., at 427\xe2\x80\x93428.  These new hurdles disproportionately burdened African-Americans, who had \xe2\x80\x9clong received inferior education in segregated schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 430.  Despite all this, the lower courts found that the company lacked discriminatory intent.  See <i>id</i>., at 428.  By convention, we do not overturn a finding of fact accepted by two lower courts, see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Rogers </i>v.<i> Lodge</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 613,\n623 (1982)\n; <i>Blau </i>v.<i> Lehman</i>,\n\n368 U.\xc2\xa0S. 403\n\xe2\x80\x93409 (1962); <i>Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. </i>v.<i> Linde Air Products Co</i>.,\n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 271,\n275 (1949)\n, so the Court was confronted with the question whether Title VII always demands intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although <i>Griggs</i> involved a question of statutory interpretation, the body of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94quite remarkably\xe2\x80\x94does not even cite the provision of Title VII on which the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were based.  The only reference to \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act appears in a single footnote that reproduces the statutory text but makes no effort to explain how it encompasses a disparate-impact claim.  See 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 426, n.\xc2\xa01.  Instead, the Court based its decision on the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d of Title VII, which the Court described as \xe2\x80\x9cachiev[ing] equality of employment opportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That text-free reasoning caused confusion, see, <i>e.g., Smith, supra</i>, at 261\xe2\x80\x93262 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment), and undoubtedly led to the pattern of Court of Appeals decisions in FHA cases upon which the majority now relies.  Those lower courts, like the <i>Griggs </i>Court, often made little effort to ground their decisions in the statutory text.  For example, in one of the earliest cases in this line, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Black Jack</i>, 508 F.\xc2\xa02d 1179 (CA8 1974), the heart of the court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was this: \xe2\x80\x9cJust as Congress requires \xe2\x80\x98the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification,\xe2\x80\x99 such barriers must also give way in the field of housing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1184 (quoting <i>Griggs</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 430\xe2\x80\x93431; citation omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike these lower courts, however, this Court has never interpreted <i>Griggs</i> as imposing a rule that applies to all antidiscrimination statutes.  See, <i>e.g., Guardians Assn.</i> v. <i>Civil Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of New York City</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 582\n, n.\xc2\xa027 (1983) (holding that Title VI,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>,<i> </i>does \xe2\x80\x9cnot allow compensatory relief in the absence of proof of discriminatory intent\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Sandoval</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 280 (similar).  Indeed, we have never held that <i>Griggs</i> even establishes a rule for all <i>employment</i> discrimination statutes.  In <i>Teamsters</i>, the Court rejected \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>Griggs</i> rationale\xe2\x80\x9d in evaluating a company\xe2\x80\x99s seniority rules.  431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  And because <i>Griggs</i> was focused on a particular problem, the Court had held that its rule does not apply where, as here, the context is different.  In <i>Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power</i> v. <i>Manhart</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 702 (1978)\n, for instance, the Court refused to apply <i>Griggs</i> to pensions under the Equal Pay Act of 1963,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7206(d) or Title VII, even if a plan has a \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportion-ately heavy impact on male employees.\xe2\x80\x9d 435 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 711, n.\xc2\xa020.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven a completely neutral practice will inevitably have <i>some</i> disproportionate impact on one group or another.  <i>Griggs</i> does not imply, and this Court has never held, that discrimination must always be inferred from such consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the opinion in <i>Griggs</i> did not grapple with the text of the provision at issue, the Court was finally required to face that task in <i>Smith</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228\n, which addressed whether the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <i>et seq.</i>, authorizes disparate-impact suits.  The Court considered two provisions of the ADEA, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), 29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a)(1) and (a)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court unanimously agreed that the first of these provisions, \xc2\xa74(a)(1), does not authorize disparate-impact claims.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236, n. 6 (plurality opinion); <i>id</i>., at 243 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning); <i>id</i>., at 249 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (reasoning that this provision \xe2\x80\x9cobvious[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d does not allow disparate-impact claims).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, a majority of the Justices found that the terms of \xc2\xa74(a)(2) either clearly authorize disparate-impact claims (the position of the plurality) or at least are ambiguous enough to provide a basis for deferring to such an interpretation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the position of Justice Scalia).  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 233\xe2\x80\x93240 (plurality opinion); <i>id</i>., at 243\xe2\x80\x93247 (opinion of Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In reaching this conclusion, these Justices reasoned that \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA was modeled on and is virtually identical to the provision in <i>Griggs</i>,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(2).

Section 4(a)(1) states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for an employer\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plurality opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, with which Justice Scalia agreed, can be summarized as follows.  Under \xc2\xa74(a)(1), <i>the employer</i> must act because of age, and thus must have discriminatory intent.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236, n. 6.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  Under \xc2\xa74(a)(2), on the other hand, it is enough if the <i>employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions</i> \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affect\xe2\x80\x9d an individual \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This analysis of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the ADEA confirms that the FHA does not allow disparate-impact claims.  Sections 804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA resemble \xc2\xa74(a)(1) of the ADEA, which the <i>Smith</i> Court unanimously agreed does not encompass disparate-impact liability.  Under these provisions of the FHA, like \xc2\xa74(a)(1) of the ADEA, a defendant must act \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d race or one of the other prohibited grounds.  That is, it is unlawful for a person or entity to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o refuse to sell or rent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crefuse to negotiate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise make unavailable,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. for a forbidden reason.  These provisions of the FHA, unlike the Title VII provision in <i>Griggs</i> or \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA, do not make it unlawful to take an action that happens to adversely affect a person because of race, religion, etc.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Smith</i> plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, moreover, also depended on other language, unique to the ADEA, declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x98to take any action <i>otherwise prohibited</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 238 (quoting\n\n81Stat.\n603; emphasis added).  This \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d language was key to the plurality opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute because it arguably suggesteddisparate-impact liability.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 238.  This language, moreover, was <i>essential</i> to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s controlling opinion.  Without it, Justice Scalia would have agreed with Justices O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas that <i>nothing</i> in the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact suits.  See <i>id.,</i> at 245\xe2\x80\x93246.  In fact, even with this \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d language, Justice Scalia merely concluded that \xc2\xa74(a)(2) was ambiguous\xe2\x80\x94<i>not</i> that disparate-impacts suits are required.  <i>Id.</i>, at 243.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The FHA does not contain any phrase like \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such language certainly is nowhere to be found in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7804(a) and 805(a).  And for all the reasons already explained, the 1988 amendments do not presuppose disparate-impact liability.  To the contrary, legislative enactments declaring only that certain actions are <i>not</i> grounds for liability do not implicitly create a new theory of liability that all other facets of the statute foreclose.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This discussion of our cases refutes any notion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ogether, <i>Griggs</i> holds[[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]] and the plurality in <i>Smith</i> instructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  The Court stumbles in concluding that \xc2\xa7804(a) of the FHA is more like \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA than \xc2\xa74(a)(1).  The operative language in \xc2\xa74(a)(1) of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x94which, per <i>Smith</i>, does not authorize disparate-impact claims\xe2\x80\x94is materially indistinguishable from the operative language in \xc2\xa7804(a) of the FHA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even more baffling, neither alone nor in combination do <i>Griggs</i> and <i>Smith</i> support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xc2\xa7805(a) of the FHA allows disparate-impact suits.  The action forbidden by that provision is \xe2\x80\x9c<i>discriminat[ion]</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of\xe2\x80\x9d race, religion, etc.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73605(a) (emphasis added).  This is precisely the formulation used in \xc2\xa74(a)(1) of the ADEA, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9c<i>discriminat[ion]</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) (emphasis added), and which <i>Smith</i> holds <i>does not</i> authorize disparate-impact claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In an effort to explain why \xc2\xa7805(a)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d allows disparate-impact suits, the Court argues that in <i>Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New York</i> v. <i>Harris</i>,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130 (1979)\n, \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory language similar to \xc2\xa7805(a) [was construed] to include disparate-impact liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  In fact, the statutory language in <i>Harris </i>was quite different.  The law there was \xc2\xa7706(d)(1)(B) of the 1972 Emergency School Aid Act, which barred assisting education agencies that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98had in effect any practice, policy, or procedure which results in the disproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or other personnel from minority groups in conjunction with desegregation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>or</i> otherwise engaged in discrimination based upon race, color, or national origin in the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 132\xe2\x80\x93133, 142 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After stating that the first clause in that unusual statute referred to a \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-impact test,\xe2\x80\x9d the <i>Harris</i> Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ca similar standard\xe2\x80\x9d should apply to the textually \xe2\x80\x9cclosely connected\xe2\x80\x9d second clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 143.  This was so, the Court thought, even though the second clause, standing alone, may very well have required discriminatory \xe2\x80\x9cintent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 139.  The Court explained that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cless than careful draftsmanship\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the relationship between the clauses made the \xe2\x80\x9cwording of the statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d about teacher assignments, thus forcing the Court to \xe2\x80\x9clook closely at the structure and context of the statute and to review its legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 138\xe2\x80\x93140.  It was the combined force of all those markers that persuaded the Court that disparate impact applied to the second clause too.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Harris</i>, in other words, has nothing to do with \xc2\xa7805(a) of the FHA.  The \xe2\x80\x9cwording\xe2\x80\x9d is different; the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d is different; the \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d is different; and the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative history\xe2\x80\x9d is different.  <i>Id.,</i> at 140.  Rather than digging up a 36-year-old case that Justices of this Court have cited all of twice, and never once for the proposition offered today, the Court would do well to recall our many cases explaining what the phase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d means.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Not only is the decision of the Court inconsistent with what the FHA says and our precedents, it will have unfortunate consequences.  Disparate-impact liability has very different implications in housing and employment cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Disparate impact puts housing authorities in a very difficult position because programs that are designed and implemented to help the poor can provide the grounds for a disparate-impact claim.  As <i>Magner</i> shows, when disparate impact is on the table, even a city\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith attempt to remedy deplorable housing conditions can be branded \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  619 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 834.  Disparate-impact claims thus threaten \xe2\x80\x9ca whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229,\n248 (1976)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case illustrates the point.  The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (the Department) has only so many tax credits to distribute.  If it gives credits for housing in lower income areas, many families\xe2\x80\x94including many minority families\xe2\x80\x94will obtain better housing.  That is a good thing.  But if the Department gives credits for housing in higher income areas, some of those families will be able to afford to move into more desirable neighborhoods.  That is also a good thing.  Either path, however, might trigger a disparate-impact suit.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is not mere speculation.  Here, one respondent has sued the Department for not allocating enough credits to higher income areas.  See Brief for Respondent Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 23.  But <i>another</i> respondent argues that giving credits to wealthy neighborhoods violates \xe2\x80\x9cthe moral imperative to improve the substandard and inadequate affordable housing in many of our inner cities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Respondent Frazier Revitalization Inc. 1.  This latter argument has special force because a city can build more housing where property is least expensive, thus benefiting more people.  In fact, federal law often favors projects that revitalize low-income communities.  See<i> ante,</i> at 2.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">No matter what the Department decides, one of these respondents will be able to bring a disparate-impact case.  And if the Department opts to compromise by dividing the credits, both respondents might be able to sue.  Congress surely did not mean to put local governments in such a position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s answer to such problems is that HUD will come to the rescue.  In particular, HUD regulations provide a defense against disparate-impact liability if a defendant can show that its actions serve \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cnecessar[ily]\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be met by \xe2\x80\x9canother practice that has a less discriminatory effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  24 CFR \xc2\xa7100.500(b) (2014).  (There is, of course, no hint of anything like this defense in the text of the FHA.  But then, there is no hint of disparate-impact liability in the text of the FHA either.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The effect of these regulations, not surprisingly, is to confer enormous discretion on HUD\xe2\x80\x94without actually solving the problem.  What is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d interest?  Is there a difference between a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d interest and a \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d interest?  To what degree must an interest be met for a practice to be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d?  How are parties and courts to measure \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory effect\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These questions are not answered by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact \xe2\x80\x9canalysis \xe2\x80\x98is analogous to the Title VII requirement that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s interest in an employment practice with a disparate impact be job related.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 4 (quoting 78 Fed. Reg. 11470).  See also <i>ante,</i> at 18 (likening the defense to \xe2\x80\x9cthe business necessity standard\xe2\x80\x9d).  The business-necessity defense is complicated enough in employment cases; what it means when plopped into the housing context is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  What is the FHA analogue of \xe2\x80\x9cjob related\xe2\x80\x9d?  Is it \xe2\x80\x9chousing related\xe2\x80\x9d?  But a vast array of municipal decisions affect property values and thus relate (at least indirectly) to housing.  And what is the FHA analogue of \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d?  \xe2\x80\x9cHousing-policy necessity\xe2\x80\x9d?  What does that mean?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compounding the problem, the Court proclaims that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmental entities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must not be prevented from achieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compliance with health and safety codes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 21.  But what does the Court mean by a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d objective?  And does the Court mean to say that there can be no disparate-impact lawsuit if the objective is \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d?  That is certainly not the view of the Government, which takes the position that a disparate-impact claim may be brought to challenge actions taken with such worthy objectives as improving housing in poor neighborhoods and making financially sound lending decisions.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 30, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because HUD\xe2\x80\x99s regulations and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncements are so \xe2\x80\x9chazy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Central Bank</i>, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188\xe2\x80\x93189, courts\xe2\x80\x94lacking expertise in the field of housing policy\xe2\x80\x94may inadvertently harm the very people that the FHA is meant to help.  Local governments make countless decisions that may have some disparate impact related to housing.  See <i>ante,</i> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Certainly Congress did not intend to \xe2\x80\x9cengage the federal courts in an endless exercise of second-guessing\xe2\x80\x9d local programs.  <i>Canton</i> v. <i>Harris</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 378,\n392 (1989)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if a city or private entity named in a disparate-impact suit believes that it is likely to prevail if a disparate-impact suit is fully litigated, the costs of litigation, in-cluding the expense of discovery and experts, may \xe2\x80\x9cpush cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bell Atlantic Corp.</i> v. <i>Twombly</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544,\n559 (2007)\n.  Defendants may feel compelled to \xe2\x80\x9cabandon substantial defenses and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pay settlements in order to avoid the expense and risk of going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Central Bank, supra, </i>at 189.  And parties fearful of disparate-impact claims may let race drive their decisionmaking in hopes of avoiding litigation altogether.  Cf. <i>Ricci</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 563.  All the while, similar dynamics may drive litigation against private actors.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is not the Fair Housing Act that Congress enacted.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">VI</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Against all of this, the Court offers several additional counterarguments.  None is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court is understandably worried about pretext.  No one thinks that those who harm others because of pro-tected characteristics should escape liability by conjuring up neutral excuses.  Disparate-treatment liability, however, is attuned to this difficulty.  Disparate impact can be <i>evidence</i> of disparate treatment.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520\n\xe2\x80\x93542 (1993) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Underwood</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222,\n233 (1985)\n.  As noted, the facially neutral requirements in <i>Griggs</i> created a strong inference of discriminatory intent.  Nearly a half century later, federal judges have decades of experience sniffing out pretext.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court also stresses that \xe2\x80\x9cmany of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities\xe2\x80\x94entities that are potential defendants in disparate-impact suits\xe2\x80\x94have submitted an <i>amicus</i> brief in this case supporting disparate-impact liability under the FHA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This nod to federalism is puzzling.  Only a minority of the States and only a small fraction of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities have urged us to hold that the FHA allowsdisparate-impact suits.  And even if a majority supported the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position, that would not be a relevant consideration for a court.  In any event, nothing prevents States and local government from enacting their own fair housing laws, including laws creating disparate-impact liability.  See\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73615 (recognizing local authority).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also claims that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he existence of disparate-impact liability in the substantial majority of the Courts of Appeals for the last several decades\xe2\x80\x9d has not created \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dire consequences.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 24.

In 1966, for example, EEOC issued guidelines suggesting that the use of employment tests in hiring decisions could violate Title VII based on disparate impact, notwithstanding the statute\xe2\x80\x99s express statement that \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be an unlawful employment practice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not <i>designed, intended, or used</i> to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(h) (emphasis added).  See EEOC, Guidelines on Employment Testing Procedures 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Aug. 24, 1966).  EEOC followed this up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit, declaring that, unless certain criteria were met, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of any test which adversely affects hiring, promotion, transfer or any other employment or membership opportunity of classes protected by title VII constitutes discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 Fed.

In their quest to eradicate what they view as institutionalized discrimination, disparate-impact proponents doggedly assume that a given racial disparity at an institution is a product of that institution rather than a reflection of disparities that exist outside of it.  See T. Sowell, Intellectuals and Race 132 (2013) (Sowell).  That might be true, or it might not.  Standing alone, the fact that a practice has a disparate impact is not conclusive evidence, as the <i>Griggs</i> Court appeared to believe, that a practice is \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 431.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough presently observed racial imbalance <i>might</i> result from past [discrimination], racial imbalance can also result from any number of innocent private decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools </i>v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 701,\n750 (2007)\n (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis added).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  We should not automatically presume that any institution with a neutral practice that happens to produce a racial disparity is guilty of discrimination until proved innocent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As best I can tell, the reason for this wholesale inversion of our law\xe2\x80\x99s usual approach is the unstated\xe2\x80\x94and unsubstantiated\xe2\x80\x94assumption that, in the absence of discrimination, an institution\xe2\x80\x99s racial makeup would mirror that of society.  But the absence of racial disparities in multi-ethnic societies has been the exception, not the rule.  When it comes to \xe2\x80\x9cproportiona[l] represent[ation]\xe2\x80\x9d of ethnic groups, \xe2\x80\x9cfew, if any, societies have ever approximated this description.\xe2\x80\x9d  D. Horowitz, Ethnic Groups in Conflict 677 (1985).  \xe2\x80\x9cAll multi-ethnic societies exhibit a tendency for ethnic groups to engage in different occupations, have different levels (and, often, types) of education, receive different incomes, and occupy a different place in the social hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weiner, The Pursuit of Ethnic Equality Through Preferential Policies: A Comparative Public Policy Perspective, in From Independence to Statehood 64 (R. Goldmann &amp; A. Wilson eds. 1984).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Racial imbalances do not always disfavor minorities.  At various times in history, \xe2\x80\x9cracial or ethnic minorities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have owned or directed more than half of whole industries in particular nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sowell 8.  These minorities \xe2\x80\x9chave included the Chinese in Malaysia, the Lebanese in West Africa, Greeks in the Ottoman Empire, Britons in Argentina, Belgians in Russia, Jews in Poland, and Spaniards in Chile\xe2\x80\x94among many others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(footnotes omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the seventeenth century Ottoman Empire,\xe2\x80\x9d this phenomenon was seen in the palace itself, where the \xe2\x80\x9cmedical staff consisted of 41 Jews and 21 Muslims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And in our own country, for roughly a quarter-century now, over 70 percent of National Basketball Association players have been black.  R. Lapchick, D. Donovan, E. Loomer, &amp; L. Martinez, Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, U. of Central Fla., The 2014 Racial and Gender Report Card: National Basketball Association 21 (June 24, 2014).  To presume that these and all other measurable disparities are products of racial discrimination is to ignore the complexities of human existence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet, if disparate-impact liability is not<i> </i>based on this assumption and is instead simply a way to correct for imbalances that do not result from any unlawful conduct, it is even less justifiable.  This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98racial balancing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by state actors is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pat-ently unconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d even when it supposedly springs from good intentions.  <i>Fisher </i>v. <i>University of Tex. at Austin</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9).  And if that \xe2\x80\x9cracial balancing\xe2\x80\x9d is achieved through disparate-impact claims limited to only some groups\xe2\x80\x94if, for instance, white basketball players cannot bring disparate-impact suits\xe2\x80\x94then we as a Court have constructed a scheme that parcels out legal privileges to individuals on the basis of skin color.  A problem with doing so should be obvious: \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment action that classifies individuals on the basis of race is inherently suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schuette</i> v. <i>BAMN</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 12); accord, <i>id.,</i> at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 9).  That is no less true when judges are the ones doing the classifying.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 12); <i>id.,</i> at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 9).  Disparate-impact liability is thus a rule without a reason, or at least without a legitimate one.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The decision in <i>Griggs</i> was bad enough, but this Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent decisions have allowed it to move to other areas of the law.  In <i>Smith</i>, for example, a plurality of this Court relied on <i>Griggs</i> to include disparate-impact liability in the ADEA.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236.  As both I and the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion recognized at the time, that decision was as incorrect as it was regrettable.  See <i>id.,</i> at 248\xe2\x80\x93249 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment).  Because we knew that Congress did not create disparate-impact liability under Title VII, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthere [wa]s no reason to suppose that Congress in 1967\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94four years before <i>Griggs</i>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccould have foreseen the interpretation of Title VII that was to come.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 260 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  It made little sense to repeat <i>Griggs</i>\xe2\x80\x99 error in a new context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">My position remains the same.  Whatever deference is due <i>Griggs</i> as a matter of <i>stare decisis</i>, we should at the very least confine it to Title VII.  We should not incorporate it into statutes such as the Fair Housing Act and the ADEA, which were passed years before Congress had any reason to suppose that this Court would take the position it did in <i>Griggs</i>.  See <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 260 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.)<i>.</i>  And we should certainly not allow it to spread to statutes like the Fair Housing Act, whose operative text, unlike that of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s, does not even mirror Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, however, the majority inexplicably declares that \xe2\x80\x9cthe logic of <i>Smith </i>and <i>Griggs</i>\xe2\x80\x9d leads to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  Justice Alito ably dismantles this argument. <i> Post, </i>at 21\xe2\x80\x9328 (dissenting opinion). But, even if the majority were correct, I would not join it in following that \xe2\x80\x9clogic\xe2\x80\x9d here.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]rroneous precedents need not be extended to their logical end, even when dealing with related provisions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.  Otherwise, <i>stare decisis</i>, designed to be a principle of stability and repose, would become a vehicle of change .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. distorting the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CBOCS West, Inc.</i> v. <i>Humphries</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442\n\xe2\x80\x93470 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).  Making the same mistake in different areas of the law furthers neither certainty nor judicial economy.  It furthers error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That error will take its toll.  The recent experience of the Houston Housing Authority (HHA) illustrates some of the many costs of disparate-impact liability.  HHA, which provides affordable housing developments to low-income residents of Houston, has over 43,000 families on its waiting lists.  The overwhelming majority of those families are black.  Because Houston is a majority-minority city with minority concentrations in all but the more affluent areas, any HHA developments built outside of those areas will increase the concentration of racial minorities.  Unsurprisingly, the threat of disparate-impact suits based on those concentrations has hindered HHA\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to provide affordable housing.  State and federal housing agencies have refused to approve all but two of HHA\xe2\x80\x99s eight proposed development projects over the past two years out of fears of disparate-impact liability.

That the majority believes that these are not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dire consequences,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>ante,</i> at 24, is cold comfort for those who actually need a home.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I agree with the majority that <i>Griggs </i>\xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] essential background\xe2\x80\x9d in this case, <i>ante,</i> at 10: It shows that our disparate-impact jurisprudence was erroneous from its inception.  Divorced from text and reality, driven by an agency with its own policy preferences, <i>Griggs</i> bears little relationship to the statutory interpretation we should expect from a court of law.
