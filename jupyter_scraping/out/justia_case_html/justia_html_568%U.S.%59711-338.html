See 33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(12).  One of the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (EPA) implementing regulations, the Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges are point sources.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.27(b)(1).  These discharges require NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision exempts them from coverage.  One such statutory provision exempts \xe2\x80\x9cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p)(1), unless the discharge is \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activ- ity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71342(p)(2)(B).  Under the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Stormwater Rule, the term \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d covers only discharges \xe2\x80\x9cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).  Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement applies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the Silvicultural Rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to harvest timber from a state forest.  When it rains, water runs off two logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams.  The discharges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms.  Respondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials, including petitioner Decker, invoking the Act\xe2\x80\x99s citizen-suit provision, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Oregon rivers.  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required because the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that the conveyances were point sources under the Silvicultural Rule.  It also concluded that the discharges were \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d under the Industrial Stormwater Rule, despite the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion that the regulation excludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.  Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the NPDES permitting scheme.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions, \xc2\xa71369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit.  That provision is the exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency decisions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issuance of permits.  It does not bar a district court from entertaining a citizen suit under \xc2\xa71365 when the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regulations.  The present action falls within the scope of \xc2\xa71365.

A live controversy continues to exist regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  That version governed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 past discharges, which might be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those types of discharges will not require a permit.  These cases thus remain live and justiciable.  See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n\xe2\x80\x9365.  The fact that the District Court might rule that NEDC\xe2\x80\x99s arguments lack merit, or that relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the cases moot.

The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71342(p)(2)(B), and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges at issue here.  When an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it \xe2\x80\x9cunless that interpretation is \xe2\x80\x98plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Chase Bank USA, N.\xc2\xa0A. v. McCoy, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n).  Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that the conveyances at issue are \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly related\xe2\x80\x9d only to the harvesting of raw materials, rather than to \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing, processing, or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).  The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and other relatively fixed facilities.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother reason to accord Auer deference to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is that there is no indication that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s current view is a change from prior practice or is a post\xc2\xa0hoc justification adopted in response to litigation.  See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads.  In exercising the broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s extensive rules on the subject.

Under the statute and its implementing regulations, a permit is required if the discharges are deemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p)(2)(B).  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the responsibility to enforce the Act, has issued a regulation defining the term \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d to cover only discharges \xe2\x80\x9cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR 122.26(b)(14) (2006).  The EPA interprets its regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue here.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24\xe2\x80\x9327.  For reasons now to be explained, the Court concludes the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s determination is a reasonable interpretation of its own regulation; and, in consequence, deference is accorded to the interpretation under Auer v. Robbins, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, \n461 (1997)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972 to \xe2\x80\x9crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n86Stat.\n816, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a).  A central provision of the Act is its require- ment that individuals, corporations, and governments se- cure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits before discharging pollution from any point source into the navigable waters of the United States.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(12); EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd., \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 200, \n205 (1976)\n.  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d as\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.  This term does not include agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen the Act took effect, the EPA found it difficult to process permit applications from countless owners and operators of point sources throughout the country.  The agency issued regulations exempting certain types of point-source discharges from the NPDES permitting scheme, but in 1977 those directives were found invalid.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the statute did not give the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to exempt categories of point sources from the permit requirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Costle, 568 F.\xc2\xa02d 1369, 1377.  In response the EPA issued new regulations to define with more precision which categories of discharges qualified as point sources in the first place.  Among these regulations was the so-called Silvicultural Rule.  This rule is at issue here.  It provides:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t \xe2\x80\x9cSilvicultural point source means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance related to rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage facilities which are operated in connection with silvicultural activities and from which pollutants are discharged into waters of the United States.  The term does not include non-point source silvicultural activities such as nursery operations, site preparation, reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment, thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road construction and maintenance from which there is natural runoff.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.27(b)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the quoted rule, any discharge from a logging-related source that qualifies as a point source requires an NPDES permit unless some other federal statutory provision exempts it from that coverage.  In one such provision, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p), Congress has exempted certain discharges of stormwater runoff.  The statutory exemptions were considered necessary because, from the outset, the EPA had encountered recurring difficulties in determining how best to manage discharges of this kind.  See, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 966 F.\xc2\xa02d 1292, 1295\xe2\x80\x931296 (CA9 1992).  In 1987, Congress responded to these problems and adopted various stormwater-related amendments to the Act.  \xc2\xa7405, \n\n101Stat.\n69, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 1987 amendments exempt from the NPDES permitting scheme most \xe2\x80\x9cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71342(p)(1).  The general exemption, however, does not extend to all stormwater discharges.  As relevant here, Congress directed the EPA to continue to require per- mits for stormwater discharges \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with indus- trial activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71342(p)(2)(B).  The statute does not define that term, but the EPA adopted a regulation (hereinafter Industrial Stormwater Rule) in which it defined it as\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.

Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West, along with other logging and paper-products companies, has a contract with the State of Oregon to harvest timber from the forest.  It uses the roads for that purpose.  When it rains (which it does often in the mountains of northwest Oregon, averaging in some areas more than 100 inches per year), water runs off the graded roads into a system of ditches, culverts, and channels that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams.  The discharges often contain large amounts of sediment, in the form of dirt and crushed gravel from the roads.  There is evidence that this runoff can harm fish and other aquatic organisms.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn September 2006, respondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.  It invoked the Clean Water Act\xe2\x80\x99s citizen-suit provision, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365, and named as defendants certain firms involved in log-ging and paper-products operations (including petitioner Georgia-Pacific West), as well as state and local governments and officials (including the State Forester of Oregon, who is now petitioner Doug Decker).  The suit alleged that the defendants caused discharges of channeled stormwater runoff into two waterways\xe2\x80\x94the South Fork Trask River and the Little South Fork Kilchis River.  The defendants had not obtained NPDES permits, and so, the suit alleged, they had violated the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.  It concluded that NPDES permits were not required because the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir- cuit reversed.  Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Brown, 640 F.\xc2\xa03d 1063 (2011).  It relied upon three principal propositions.  First, it held that the District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71365 notwithstanding a different provision of the Act, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1), limiting judicial review of EPA regulations.  Second, the Court of Appeals held that while the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Silvicultural Rule is ambiguous on the question whether the conveyances at issue are point sources, those conveyances must be deemed point sources under the rule in order to give effect to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expansive definition of the term.  Third, the Court of Appeals held that because the Industrial Stormwater Rule makes cross-reference to Standard Industrial Classification 24, the discharges at issue are \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the regulation, despite the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the con- trary.  The regulation was held to be unambiguous on this point.  The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the dis- charges were from point sources and not exempt from the NPDES permitting scheme by the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  It followed that petitioners had been in violation of the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court granted certiorari.  567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore proceeding to the merits, it is necessary to consider two jurisdictional questions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent NEDC invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court under \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365(a), which \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize[s] private enforcement of the provisions of [the Clean Water Act]\xe2\x80\x9d and its implementing regulations.  Department of Energy v. Ohio, \n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 607, \n613, n. \n5 (1992)\n.  Petitioners, however, maintain that this suit is barred by a separate provision of the Act, \xc2\xa71369(b).  That statute provides for \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review in the United States courts of appeals of various particular actions by the [EPA] Administrator, including establishment of effluent standards and issuance of permits for discharge of pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., \n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (1981).  Where that review is available, it is the exclusive means of challenging actions covered by the statute, \xc2\xa71369(b)(2), and an application for review must be lodged in the court of appeals within 120 days of the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s action, \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the exclusive jurisdiction mandate is not applicable in this suit.  Section 1369(b) extends only to certain suits challenging some agency actions.  It does not bar a district court from entertaining a citizen suit under \xc2\xa71365 when the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regulations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe present action is within the scope of \xc2\xa71365.  It is a claim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of the Silvicultural Rule.  The rule is ambiguous: Its characterization of silvicultural harvesting operations \xe2\x80\x9cfrom which there is natural runoff,\xe2\x80\x9d 40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.27(b)(1), as a nonpoint source might be read, as petitioners contend, to apply to the channeled stormwater runoff at issue; or it might be read, as respondent NEDC urges, to apply only to runoff not collected in channels or other engineered improvements.  See New Oxford American Dictionary 1167 (3d ed. 2010) (Oxford Dict.) (\xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cexisting in or caused by nature; not made or caused by humankind\xe2\x80\x9d).  NEDC\xe2\x80\x99s reading would make the channeled discharges here point-source pollution under the Act.  In its view only this interpretation can be squared with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14).  On this premise, the instant suit is an effort not to challenge the Silvicultural Rule but to enforce it under a proper interpretation.  It is a basic tenet that \xe2\x80\x9cregulations, in order to be valid, must be consistent with the statute under which they are promulgated.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful but permissible reading of the regulation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to bring it into harmony with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Environmental Defense v.

This principle requires us to determine whether the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule makes the cases moot.  In a supplemental brief filed after oral argument, petitioner Decker, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, takes the position that the recent amendment makes these cases moot in relevant part.

The Act contemplates civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71319(d), as well as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for prevailing parties, \xc2\xa71365(d).  NEDC, in addition, requests injunctive relief for both past and ongoing violations, in part in the form of an order that petitioners incur certain environmental-remediation costs to alleviate harms attributable to their past discharges.  Under these circumstances, the cases remain live and justiciable, for the possibility of some remedy for a proven past violation is real and not remote.  See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n\xe2\x80\x9365 (1987).  The District Court, it is true, might rule that NEDC\xe2\x80\x99s arguments lack merit, or that the relief it seeks is not warranted on the facts of these cases.

Under the Act, petitioners were required to secure NPDES permits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff only if the discharges were \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p)(2)(B), as that statutory term is defined in the preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14) (2006).  Otherwise, the discharges fall within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s general exemption of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater\xe2\x80\x9d from the NPDES permitting scheme.  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNEDC first contends that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d unambiguously covers discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93843 (1984).  That view, however, overlooks the multiple definitions of the terms \xe2\x80\x9cindus- trial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindustry.\xe2\x80\x9d  These words can refer to business activity in general, yet so too can they be limited to \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic activity concerned with the processing of raw materials and manufacture of goods in factories.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oxford Dict. 887.  The latter definition does not necessarily encompass outdoor timber harvesting.  The statute does not foreclose more specific definition by the agency, since it provides no further detail as to its intended scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSomewhat more plausible is NEDC\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule unambiguously required a permit for the discharges at issue.  NEDC reasons that under the rule, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or the categories of industries identified in this section,\xe2\x80\x9d NPDES permits are required for, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cstorm water discharges from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. immediate access roads .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. used or traveled by carriers of raw materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14) (2006).  Yet this raises the question whether logging is a \xe2\x80\x9ccategor[y] of industr[y]\xe2\x80\x9d identified by the section.  The regulation goes on to identify a list of \xe2\x80\x9ccategories of facilities\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9care considered to be engaging in \xe2\x80\x98industrial activity\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  Ibid.  In the earlier version of the regulation, this list included \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acilities classified as Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24,\xe2\x80\x9d which encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cLogging.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  See also supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Hence, NEDC asserts, logging is among the categories of industries for which \xe2\x80\x9cstorm water discharges from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. immediate access roads .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. used or traveled by carriers of raw materials\xe2\x80\x9d required NPDES permits under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.  \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).  NEDC further notes, in support of its reading of the regulation, that modern logging is a large-scale, highly mechanized enterprise, using sophisticated harvesting machines weighing up to 20 tons.  See Brief for Respondent 4\xe2\x80\x935.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EPA takes a different view.  It concludes that the earlier regulation invoked Standard Industrial Classification 24 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to regulate traditional industrial sources such as sawmills.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  It points to the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities\xe2\x80\x9d and the classification\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cestablishments,\xe2\x80\x9d which suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent than outdoor timber-harvesting operations.  Ibid.  See also 55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48008 (1990).  This reading is re- inforced by the Industrial Stormwater Rule\xe2\x80\x99s definition of discharges associated with industrial activity as discharges \xe2\x80\x9cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14) (2006).  This language lends support to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the regulation does not cover temporary, outdoor logging installations.  It was reasonable for the agency to conclude that the conveyances at issue are \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly related\xe2\x80\x9d only to the harvesting of raw materials, rather than to \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9craw materials storage areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Oxford Dict. 1066 (manufacturing is \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] (something) on a large scale using machinery\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 1392 (processing is \xe2\x80\x9cperform[ing] a series of mechanical or chemical operations on (something) in order to change or preserve it\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, even if logging as a general matter is a type of economic activity within the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s scope, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation could still require the discharges to be related in a direct way to operations \xe2\x80\x9cat an industrial plant\xe2\x80\x9d in order to be subject to NPDES permitting.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNEDC resists this conclusion, noting that elsewhere in the Industrial Stormwater Rule the EPA has required NPDES permits for stormwater discharges associated with other types of outdoor economic activity.  See \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(iii) (mining); \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(v) (landfills receiving industrial waste); \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(x) (large construction sites).  The EPA reasonably could conclude, however, that these types of activities tend to be more fixed and permanent than timber-harvesting operations are and have a closer connection to traditional industrial sites.  In light of the language of the regulation just discussed, moreover, the inclusion of these types of economic activity in the Industrial Stormwater Rule need not be read to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to these activities fall within the rule, just as the inclusion of logging need not be read to extend to all discharges from logging sites.  The regulation\xe2\x80\x99s reach may be limited by the requirement that the discharges be \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is well established that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation need not be the only possible reading of a regulation\xe2\x80\x94or even the best one\xe2\x80\x94to prevail.  When an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it \xe2\x80\x9cunless that interpretation is \xe2\x80\x98plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Chase Bank USA, N.\xc2\xa0A. v.

The State of Oregon has made an extensive effort to develop a comprehensive set of best practices to manage stormwater runoff from logging roads.  These practices include rules mandating filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters rivers and streams, Ore. Admin. Rule 629\xe2\x80\x93625\xe2\x80\x930330(4) (2012); requiring logging companies to construct roads using surfacing that minimizes the sediment in runoff, Rule 629\xe2\x80\x93625\xe2\x80\x930700(2); and obligating firms to cease operations where such efforts fail to prevent vis- ible increases in water turbidity, Rule 629\xe2\x80\x93625\xe2\x80\x930700(3).  Oregon has invested substantial time and money in establishing these practices.  In addition, the development, siting, maintenance, and regulation of roads\xe2\x80\x94and in particular of state forest roads\xe2\x80\x94are areas in which Oregon has considerable expertise.  In exercising the broad discretion the Clean Water Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation in this area would be duplicative or counterproductive.  Indeed, Congress has given express instructions to the EPA to work \xe2\x80\x9cin consultation with State and local officials\xe2\x80\x9d to alleviate stormwater pollution by developing the precise kind of best management practices Oregon has established here.  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(p)(6).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule, as permissibly construed by the agency, exempts discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES permitting scheme.

Michigan Bell Telephone Co., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1).  This is generally called Seminole Rock or Auer deference.  See Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., \n\n325 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410 (1945)\n; Auer v. Robbins, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452 (1997)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo Terms ago, in my separate concurrence in Talk America, I expressed doubts about the validity of this practice.  In that case, however, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the rule was also the fairest one, and no party had asked us to reconsider Auer.  Today, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s deference to the agency makes the difference (note the Court\xe2\x80\x99s defensive insistence that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation need not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe best one,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14).  And respon- dent has asked us, if necessary, to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reconsider Auer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  I believe that it is time to do so.  See Brief for Respondent  42, n.\xc2\xa012; see also Brief for Law Professors on the Propri- ety of Administrative Deference as Amici Curiae.  This is especially true because the circumstances of these cases illustrate Auer\xe2\x80\x99s flaws in a particularly vivid way.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe canonical formulation of Auer deference is that we will enforce an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own rules unless that interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Seminole Rock, supra, at 414.  But of course whenever the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the regulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that sense \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d with the regulation.  Obviously, that is not enough, or there would be nothing for Auer to do.  In practice, Auer deference is Chevron deference applied to regulations rather than statutes.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837 (1984)\n.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will be accepted if, though not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a plausible reading\xe2\x80\x94within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contains.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for Auer deference.  The first case to apply it, Seminole Rock, offered no justification whatever\xe2\x80\x94just the ipse dixit that \xe2\x80\x9cthe administrative interpretation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 414.  Our later cases provide two principal explanations, neither of which has much to be said for it.  See generally Stephenson &amp; Pogoriler, Seminole Rock\xe2\x80\x99s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1449, 1454\xe2\x80\x931458 (2011).  First, some cases say that the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some special insight into its intent when enacting it.  E.g., Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144\n\xe2\x80\x93153 (1991).  The implied premise of this argument\xe2\x80\x94that what we are looking for is the agency\xe2\x80\x99s intent in adopting the rule\xe2\x80\x94is false.  There is true of regulations what is true of statutes.  As Justice Holmes put it: \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Theory of Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 417, 419 (1899).  Whether governing rules are made by the national legislature or an administrative agency, we are bound by what they say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who made them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98complex and highly technical regulatory program.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 504, \n512 (1994)\n.  That is true enough, and it leads to the conclu- sion that agencies and not courts should make regula- tions.  But it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations\xe2\x80\x94unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective.  Making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of rulemaking, in which the agency uses its \xe2\x80\x9cspecial expertise\xe2\x80\x9d to formulate the best rule.  But the purpose of interpretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9csay what the law is,\xe2\x80\x9d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  Not to make policy, but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to which the public owes obedience.  Indeed, since the leadership of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agencies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency head can only be sure that the application of his \xe2\x80\x9cspecial expertise\xe2\x80\x9d to the issue addressed by a regulation will be given effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial expertise\xe2\x80\x9d of his successors.  If we take agency enactments as written, the Executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother conceivable justification for Auer deference, though not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it is reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of statutes that Congress enacted, as we do per Chevron, it is a fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the meaning of regulations that they themselves crafted.  To give an agency less control over the meaning of its own regulations than it has over the meaning of a congressionally enacted statute seems quite odd.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut it is not odd at all.  The theory of Chevron (take it or leave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority to administer a statute, including authority to issue in- terpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a degree of discretion, which the courts must respect, regarding the meaning of the statute.  See Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A., \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735\n\xe2\x80\x93741 (1996).  While the implication of an agency power to clarify the statute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities in its own regulations.  For that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of powers\xe2\x80\x94that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest in the same hands.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151\xe2\x80\x93152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949).  Congress cannot enlarge its own power through Chevron\xe2\x80\x94whatever it leaves vague in the statute will be worked out by someone else.  Chevron represents a presumption about who, as between the Executive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be.  (The Executive, by the way\xe2\x80\x94the competing political branch\xe2\x80\x94is the less congenial repository of the power as far as Congress is concerned.)  So Congress\xe2\x80\x99s incentive is to speak as clearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut when an agency interprets its own rules\xe2\x80\x94that is something else.  Then the power to prescribe is augmented by the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak vaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d that will enable \xe2\x80\x9cclarification\xe2\x80\x9d with retroactive effect.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is per- fectly understandable\xe2\x80\x9d for an agency to \xe2\x80\x9cissue vague regula- tions\xe2\x80\x9d if doing so will \xe2\x80\x9cmaximiz[e] agency power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thomas Jefferson Univ., supra, at 525 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Combining the power to prescribe with the power to interpret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice of resolving doubts about \xe2\x80\x9cthe construction of the Roman laws\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cstat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and tak[ing] his opinion upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 58 (1765).  And our Constitution did not mirror the British practice of using the House of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the fear that he who has \xe2\x80\x9cagency in passing bad laws\xe2\x80\x9d might operate in the \xe2\x80\x9csame spirit\xe2\x80\x9d in their interpretation.  The Federalist No. 81, pp. 543\xe2\x80\x93544 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Auer deference encourages agencies to be \xe2\x80\x9cvague in framing regulations, with the plan of issuing \xe2\x80\x98interpretations\xe2\x80\x99 to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anthony, The Supreme Court and the APA: Sometimes They Just Don\xe2\x80\x99t Get It, 10 Admin. L.\xc2\xa0J. Am. U. 1, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (1996).  Auer is not a logical corollary to Chevron but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.  See Talk America, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933); Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 612 (1996).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true enough that Auer deference has the same beneficial pragmatic effect as Chevron deference: The country need not endure the uncertainty produced by divergent views of numerous district courts and courts of appeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation, until a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by this Court.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s view can be relied upon, unless it is, so to speak, beyond the pale.  But the duration of the uncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute.  For as soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is pronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the process of amending the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear.  The circumstances of this case demonstrate the point.  While these cases were being briefed before us, EPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of Appeals judgment we are reviewing.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 72974 (2012) (to be codified in 40 CFR pt. 122, sub pt. B).  It did so (by the standards of such things) relatively quickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011, and in December 2012 the EPA published an amended rule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it ar- gues here.  And there is another respect in which a lack of Chevron-type deference has less severe pragmatic consequences for rules than for statutes.  In many cases, when an agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the text arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion not to prosecute.  That is not possible, of course, when, as here, a party harmed by the violation has standing to compel enforcement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any case, however great may be the efficiency gains derived from Auer deference, beneficial effect cannot jus- tify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contravenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He who writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would therefore resolve these cases by using the familiar tools of textual interpretation to decide: Is what the petitioners did here proscribed by the fairest reading of the regulations?  What they did was to channel stormwater runoff from logging roads without a permit.  To decide whether that was permissible we must answer one, and possibly two, questions: First, was the stormwater discharged from a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d?  If not, no permit was required.  But if so, we face the second question: Were the stormwater discharges exempt from the permit requirement because they were not \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d?  The fairest reading of the statute and regulations is that these discharges were from point sources, and were associated with industrial activity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharging pollution without a permit from what it calls a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71311(a).

In my view, giving the term the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would contradict the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source,\xe2\x80\x9d which explicitly includes any \xe2\x80\x9cpipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, [and] conduit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Applying the interpretive presumption of validity\xe2\x80\x94the canon that we are to \xe2\x80\x9cprefe[r] the meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys,\xe2\x80\x9d Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n\n293 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388, \n439 (1935)\n (Cardozo, J., dissenting)\xe2\x80\x94I would hold that the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cnatural runoff\xe2\x80\x9d does not reach the situation here.  The stormwater discharges came from point sources, because they flowed out of artificial \xe2\x80\x9cpipe[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cditch[es],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchannel[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14), and were thus not \xe2\x80\x9cnatural runoff\xe2\x80\x9d from a logging opera- tion, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.27(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMany point-source stormwater discharges are nonetheless exempt from the usual permitting requirement.

EPA has enacted a rule defining what it means for stormwater discharges to be \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with\xe2\x80\x9d industrial activity, and what activities count as \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe regulation sets out eleven \xe2\x80\x9ccategories of industries\xe2\x80\x9d; as to those industries, discharges are \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d if they come from sites used for \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany raw material.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The forest roads at issue here are used to transport raw material (logs); the only question is whether logging is a \xe2\x80\x9ccategor[y] of industr[y]\xe2\x80\x9d enumerated in the definition.  It is: The second of the listed \xe2\x80\x9ccategories of facilities\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acilities classified as Standard Industrial Classifications 24 (except 2434).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(ii).  Opening one\xe2\x80\x99s hymnal to Standard Industrial Classification 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cLumber and Wood Products, Except Furniture\xe2\x80\x9d), one finds that the first industry group listed, No. 2411, is \xe2\x80\x9cLogging\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[e]stablish- ments primarily engaged in cutting timber.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 App. 64.  (As if that were not clear enough, an illustrative product of this industry is helpfully listed: \xe2\x80\x9cLogs.\xe2\x80\x9d)  That, I would think, is that.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEPA disagrees, and the Court gives the agency\xe2\x80\x99s position Auer deference, but that reading is certainly not the most natural one.  The Court relies heavily on the fact that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]torm water discharge associ- ated with industrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d requires that the discharge be \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14).  The crucial question this definition presents is whether the concluding phrase \xe2\x80\x9cat an industrial plant\xe2\x80\x9d limits only the last noun phrase (\xe2\x80\x9craw materials storage areas\xe2\x80\x9d) or also the two preceding nouns (\xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing\xe2\x80\x9d).  The canon of interpretation known as the rule of the last antecedent states that \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting clause or phrase .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnhart v. Thomas, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20, \n26 (2003)\n.  If a statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9cit shall be unlawful to possess a grenade launcher, a fully-automatic weapon, or a shotgun with a barrel shorter than 12 inches,\xe2\x80\x9d that does not mean that a grenade launcher with a barrel longer than 12 inches is legal.  Application of the canon would mean that \xe2\x80\x9cat an industrial plant\xe2\x80\x9d modifies only \xe2\x80\x9craw materials storage areas,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore that \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere, including in the forest, would be \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with industrial activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Standard Industrial Classification 24 categorizes logging as a manufacturing business, and these discharges are therefore \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly related to manufacturing.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike all canons of interpretation, the rule of the last antecedent can be overcome by textual indication of contrary meaning.  But that does not exist here.  To the contrary, the enumerated categories of industries to which the term \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d applies reinforce the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cat an industrial plant\xe2\x80\x9d does not modify \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term includes (in addition to logging) \xe2\x80\x9cactive or inactive mining operations,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(iii); \xe2\x80\x9c[l]andfills\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copen dumps,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(v); \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile junkyards,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(vi); and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onstruction activity including clearing, grading and excavation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(x).  Those industries and activities (while related to manufacturing and processing) virtually never take place at anything like what one might describe as a \xe2\x80\x9cplant.\xe2\x80\x9d  The rule of the last antecedent is therefore confirmed as the correct guide to meaning here: \xe2\x80\x9cat an industrial plant\xe2\x80\x9d limits only \xe2\x80\x9craw materials storage areas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEPA also insists, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24, that the regulation reaches only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d sources of industrial stormwater, such as sawmills.  But Standard Industrial Classification 24 has a specific subcategory (No. 242) that is \xe2\x80\x9cSawmills and Planing Mills.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 App. 64.  The rule is not so limited, reaching by its terms \xe2\x80\x9cStandard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24 (except 2434).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(ii).  The explicit carving-out of No. 2434 is telling: Why EPA chose to exclude \xe2\x80\x9cestablishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wood kitchen cabinet and wood bathroom vanities\xe2\x80\x9d from the definition of industrial stormwater, I do not know\xe2\x80\x94but the picayune nature of the exclusion gives lie to the idea that the rule\xe2\x80\x99s scope ought to be decided by a rough sense of its gestalt.  If EPA had meant to reach only sawmills, it quite obviously knew how to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Court believes that Standard Industrial Classification 24\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cestablishments\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[s] industrial sites more fixed and permanent than outdoor timber-harvesting operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  Not so.  The Standard Industrial Classification uses \xe2\x80\x9ces- tablishments\xe2\x80\x9d throughout to refer to business entities in general; for example, Classification 2411 refers to \xe2\x80\x9c[e]stablishments primarily engaged in cutting timber,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes \xe2\x80\x9cproducing wood chips in the field.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 App. 64.  I cannot imagine what kind of \xe2\x80\x9cfixed and permanent\xe2\x80\x9d industrial site the Court and EPA imagine will be \xe2\x80\x9cproducing wood chips in the field.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s final point, ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x94that the regulatory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial activity\xe2\x80\x9d uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cuts the other way: EPA regulations define \xe2\x80\x9cfacility\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98point source.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.2; see, e.g., \xc2\xa7122.26(b)(14)(iii) (referring to mines as \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe agency also assures us that its intent (Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25) was to reach a more limited subset of logging activities, an intent that it believes can essentially float free from the text of the relevant rule.  In the end, this is the real meat of the matter: EPA states that it simply did not mean to require permits for the discharges at issue here.  And the Court is willing to credit that intent, even given what I think has been amply demonstrated to be a contrary text.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the fairest reading of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s rules proscribes the conduct at issue in these cases, I would affirm the judgment below.
