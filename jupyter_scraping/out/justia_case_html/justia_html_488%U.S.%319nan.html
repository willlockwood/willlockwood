S. 322</a></p><p> lost" carrying out his union duties.  After an audit the Union\'s president, respondent Hardin, disallowed these payments.  Hardin ruled that petitioner was not entitled to the payments because he had failed to obtain approval for them prior to doing the tasks that caused him to lose time, and because his salary as an officer of the Local was intended to cover all his official duties.  When petitioner subsequently attempted to enforce a policy that reimbursements required prior approval -- denying unapproved claims by the president and other officers of the Local -- Hardin overruled these decisions.  Petitioner thereupon unsuccessfully sought reinstatement of his disallowed payment.  In a series of letters to Hardin, the last dated August 2, 1983, petitioner alleged that more stringent standards had been applied to his reimbursement claims because he had been critical of the Local\'s president.  Threatening suit, he asserted that the disallowance amounted to harassment for expressing his views on union matters and violated LMRDA \xc2\xa7 101.  Petitioner did not file this action in the Western District of North Carolina against the Union and various of its officers, however, until August 2, 1985.</p>\n<p>Respondents moved for summary judgment, arguing that petitioner had filed his suit out of time.

Indeed, the amendments that eventually were enacted as Title I were introduced under the heading of "Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations."  <em>See Finnegan v.

Congress considered the protection afforded by Title I to free speech and assembly in the union context necessary to bring an end to abuses by union leadership that had curtailed union democracy.  It</p>\n<p>"adopted the freedom of speech and assembly provision in order to promote union democracy . . .

Thus the core purpose of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) is to protect free speech and assembly rights because these are considered "vital to the independence of the membership and the effective and fair operation of the union as the representative."  <em>Hall v.

Time-consuming litigation as to the collateral question of the appropriate statute of limitations for a \xc2\xa7 101 claim would likely interfere with Congress\' aim that actions to enforce free speech and association rights should in fact enhance union democracy.  Such litigation creates uncertainty as to the time available for filing, and it would not be surprising if the prospect of perhaps prolonged litigation against the union before ever the merits are reached were to have a deterrent effect on would be \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) plaintiffs.  The diversion of resources to collateral statute of limitations litigation would be foreign to the central purposes of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2), and thus we are persuaded that all claims under that provision should be characterized in the same way.  Determining exactly how they should be characterized does not appear to us to be a difficult task, given a proper understanding of the narrow scope of the <em>DelCostello</em> exception to our standard borrowing rule, and of the nature and purpose of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2).\n</em></p>\n<p>Because \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) protects rights of free speech and assembly, and was patterned after the First Amendment, it is readily analogized for the purpose of borrowing a statute of limitations to state personal injury actions.  We find it unnecessary to detail here the elements of this analogy.  We have previously considered possible analogies between federal civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (which lacks an express statute of limitations) and various state law claims, and have held that \xc2\xa7 1983 actions are governed by state general or residual personal injury statutes of limitations.  <em>Owens v.

Since \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) has evident similarities to \xc2\xa7 1983, which prohibits the infringement of First Amendment rights by persons acting under color of state law, it is apparent that \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) actions also are analogous to state personal injury claims, and under our usual borrowing rule would take their statutes of limitations.  Moreover, these state personal injury statutes are of sufficient length, <em>see Owens, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/235/case.html#248">488 U.

This argument lacks merit.

The specific focus of our comparison between unfair labor practice charges governed by \xc2\xa7 10(b) and hybrid \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation claims was their effects upon the formation and operation of the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the bargaining representative, and upon the private settlement of disputes under that agreement through grievance and arbitration procedures.

To be sure, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p>"Internal union disputes, if allowed to fester, may erode the confidence of union members in their leaders and possibly cause a disaffection with the union, thus weakening the union and its ability to bargain for its members.  Such prolonged disputes may also distract union officials from their sole purpose -- representation of union members in their relations with their employer.  These probable effects of protracted disputes may be destabilizing to labor-management relations."</p>\n<p>828 F.2d at 1070.  <em>See also Local Union 1397, supra,</em> at 184 ("[D]issension within a union naturally affects that union\'s activities and effectiveness </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 488 U. S. 331</a></p><p> in the collective bargaining arena").  These observations have some plausibility.  But they are not enough to persuade us that federal policy requires that \xc2\xa7 10(b) govern claims under \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA, for they establish no more than that \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) actions may sometimes have "some impact on economic relations between union and employer and on labor peace."  Brief for Respondents 22.  This is substantially less immediate and less significant an impact on bargaining and private dispute settlement than that which led us to apply the \xc2\xa7 10(b) statute to hybrid \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation claims, which directly challenge both the employer\'s adherence to the collective bargaining agreement and the union\'s representation of the employee in grievance and arbitration procedures.  As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted in <em>Doty v. Sewall,</em> 784 F.2d at 7, a Title I suit does not directly</p>\n<p>"challeng[e] the \'stable relationship\' between the employer and the union.  It does not affect any interpretation or effect any reinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and so, unlike the hybrid actions, a Title I claim does not attack a compromise between labor and management. . . .  There is no erosion of the finality of private settlements, for in the free standing LMRDA cases the union member is not attempting to attack any such settlement."</p>\n<p><em>See also Davis v. United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America,</em> 765 F.2d 1510, 1514 (CA11 1985).  Thus the federal interests in collective bargaining and in the resolution of disputes under collective bargaining agreements, which require application of a 6-month statute of limitations to unfair labor practice charges and hybrid \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation claims, simply are not directly involved in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) actions. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 488 U. S. 332</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is another and more important reason why we cannot conclude in this case, as we did in <em>DelCostello,</em> that \xc2\xa7 10(b) provides "a federal statute of limitations actually designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake here."  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#169">462 U. S. 169</a></span>.  Section 101(a)(2) implements a federal policy -- to guarantee free speech and association rights in order to further union democracy -- that simply had no part in the design of a statute of limitations for unfair labor practice charges.  Indeed, Title I of the LMRDA was a response to a perception that the NLRA, including the \xc2\xa7 8(b) provisions defining unfair labor practices by labor organizations, had failed to provide the necessary protection for the free speech and other rights of union members that Congress considered essential to the democratic operation of unions.  <em>See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Sadlowski,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/102/case.html">457 U.

Hence while \xc2\xa7 10(b) was "<em>attuned to . . . the . . . balance between national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements\'" on the one hand, and "`an employee\'s interest in setting aside [a] settlement under the collective bargaining system\'" on the other, <em>DelCostello, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#171">462 U.

Hence it is not the case that "the federal policies at stake" in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) actions make the \xc2\xa7 10(b) statute of limitations "a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking" than the analogous state statute of limitations that our established borrowing rule favors.

Indeed, we have already held that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, which like \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) protects the exercise of First Amendment rights, is governed by state general or residual personal injury statutes of limitations.  <em>Owens v.

The well-established rule that statutes of limitations for federal causes of action not supplied with their own limitations periods will be borrowed from state law thus requires that state general or residual personal injury statutes be applied to \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) suits.  None of the exceptions to that rule apply, for \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the NLRA does not supply a more analogous statute; its 6-month limitations period is not better suited to the practicalities of \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) litigation; and it was not designed to accommodate federal policies similar to those implicated in \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) actions.

S. 143</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/case.html#170">483 U. S. 170</a></span> (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am persuaded that the 6-month statute of limitations prescribed by \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 488 U. S. 335</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(b), should govern this action brought under \xc2\xa7 101 of Title I of the Labor-Manangement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 411.  Title I was part of a statute the purpose of which was to require that unions and employers adhere to high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in order to protect employee rights to organize and bargain collectively.  Title I was thus necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor unions and employers that "distort and defeat" the policies of the labor laws. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 401(a)-(c).  It is not readily apparent to me that Congress was simply moving to enforce the First Amendment, rather than to ensure that unions were truly and effectively the representatives of their members for the purpose of collective bargaining.  I therefore do not think that the 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 rule furnishes a closer analogy than does \xc2\xa7 10(b); neither does it serve the policies of the labor laws nor further the interests of consistency and repose that are involved in the early settlement of disputes between unions and their members.</p>\n<p>Undeniably, Congress made it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their organizational and collective bargaining rights, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(a), thus seeking to protect the same interests furthered by Title I, yet insisting that such charges be aired and decided in prompt fashion.  Furthermore, there can be no doubt that a great many alleged violations of Title I could be filed with the Board as unfair labor practices subject to the 6-month limitations period of \xc2\xa7 10(b).  I find nothing of real substance in the Court\'s opinion to justify borrowing the much longer state statute that was not designed with the interests of the federal labor laws in mind.</p>\n<p>Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
