ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s extensive reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping requirements are central to, and an essential part of, this uniform plan administration system.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law and regulation, however, also govern plan reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping.  Pre-emption is necessary in order to prevent multiple jurisdictions from imposing differing, or even parallel, regulations, creating wasteful administrative costs and threatening to subject plans to wide-ranging liability.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s uniform rule design also makes clear that it is the Secretary of Labor, not the separate States, that is authorized to decide whether to exempt plans from ERISA reporting requirements or to require ERISA plans to report data such as that sought by Vermont.

Vermont argues that respondent has not shown that the State scheme has caused it to suffer economic costs, but respondent need not wait to bring its pre-emption claim until confronted with numerous inconsistent obligations and encumbered with any ensuing costs.  In addition, the fact that ERISA and the state reporting scheme have different objectives does not transform Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s direct regulation of a fundamental ERISA function into an innocuous and peripheral set of additional rules.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s regime also cannot be saved by invoking the State\xe2\x80\x99s traditional power to regulate in the area of public health.

Vermont enacted the statute so it could maintain an all-inclusive health care database.Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa79410(a)(1) (2015 Cum. Supp.) (\xc2\xa0V.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.).  The state law, by its terms, applies to health plans established by employers and regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n\n88Stat.\n829, as amended,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>  The question before the Court is whether ERISA pre-empts the Vermont statute as it applies to ERISA plans.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Vermont requires certain public and private entities that provide and pay for health care services to report information to a state agency.  The reported information is compiled into a database reflecting \xe2\x80\x9call health care utilization, costs, and resources in [\xc2\xa0Vermont], and health care utilization and costs for services provided to Vermont residents in another state.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 V. S. A. \xc2\xa79410(b).  A database of this kind is sometimes called an all-payer claims database, for it requires submission of data from all health insurers and other entities that pay for health care services.  Almost 20 States have or are implementing similar databases.  See Brief for State of New York et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1, and n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law requires health insurers, health care providers, health care facilities, and governmental agencies to report any \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relating to health care costs, prices, quality, utilization, or resources required\xe2\x80\x9d by the state agency, including data relating to health insurance claims and enrollment.  \xc2\xa79410(c)(3).  Health insurers must submit claims data on members, subscribers, and policyholders.  \xc2\xa79410(h).  The Vermont law defines health insurer to include a \xe2\x80\x9cself-insured .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. health care benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79402(8), as well as \xe2\x80\x9cany third party administrator\xe2\x80\x9d and any \xe2\x80\x9csimilar entity with claims data, eligibility data, provider files, and other information relating to health care provided to a Vermont resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79410(\xc2\xa0j)(1)(B).  The database must be made \xe2\x80\x9cavailable as a resource for insurers, employers, providers, purchasers of health care, and State agencies to continuously review health care utili-zation, expenditures, and performance in Vermont.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79410(h)(3)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Vermont law leaves to a state agency the responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish the types of information to be filed under this section, and the time and place and the manner in which such information shall be filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79410(d).  The law has been implemented by a regulation creating the Vermont Healthcare Claims Uniform Reporting and Evaluation System.  The regulation requires the submission of \xe2\x80\x9cmedical claims data, pharmacy claims data, member eligibility data, provider data, and other information,\xe2\x80\x9d Reg. H\xe2\x80\x932008\xe2\x80\x9301, Code of Vt. Rules 21\xe2\x80\x93040\xe2\x80\x93021, \xc2\xa74(D) (2016) (CVR),in accordance with specific formatting, coding, and other requirements, \xc2\xa75.  Under the regulation, health insurers must report data about the health care services provided to Vermonters regardless of whether they are treated in Vermont or out-of-state and about non-Vermonters who are treated in Vermont.  \xc2\xa74(D); see also \xc2\xa71.  The agency at present does not collect data on denied claims, \xc2\xa75(A)(8), but the statute would allow it to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Covered entities (reporters) must register with the State and must submit data monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the number of individuals that an entity serves.

The Plan is self-insured and self-funded, which means that Plan benefits are paid by respondent.

Respondent, as the Plan sponsor, is both a fiduciary and plan administrator.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Plan uses Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (Blue Cross) as a third-party administrator.  Blue Cross manages the \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing, review, and payment\xe2\x80\x9d of claims for respondent.  <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Donegan</i>, 746 F.\xc2\xa03d 497, 502 (CA2 2014) (case below).  In its contract with Blue Cross, respondent agreed to \xe2\x80\x9chold [Blue Cross] harmless for any charges, including legal fees, judgments, administrative expenses and benefit payment requirements, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. arising from or in connection with [the Plan] or due to [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] failure to comply with any laws or regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 82.  The Plan is a voluntary reporter under the Vermont regulation because it covers some 137 Vermonters, which is fewer than the 200-person cutoff for mandated reporting.  Blue Cross, however, serves several thousand Vermonters, and so it is a mandated reporter.  Blue Cross, therefore, must report the information it possesses about the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s members in Vermont.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In August 2011, Vermont issued a subpoena ordering Blue Cross to transmit to a state-appointed contractor all the files it possessed on member eligibility, medical claims, and pharmacy claims for Vermont members.  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.  (For clarity, the Court uses \xe2\x80\x9cVermont\xe2\x80\x9d to refer not only to the State but also to state officials acting in their official capacity.)  The penalty for noncompliance, Vermont threatened, would be a fine of up to $2,000 a day and a suspension of Blue Cross\xe2\x80\x99 authorization to operate in Vermont for as long as six months.  <i>Id.,</i> at 31.  Respondent, concerned in part that the disclosure of confidential information regarding its members might violate its fiduciary duties under the Plan, instructed Blue Cross not to comply.  Respondent then filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont.  It sought a declaration that ERISA pre-empts application of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute and regulation to the Plan and an injunction forbidding Vermont from trying to acquire data about the Plan or its members.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Vermont filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court treated as one for summary judgment, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa012(d), and respondent filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Vermont.  It first held that respondent, despite being a mere voluntary reporter, had standing to sue because it was faced with either allegedly violating its \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary and administrative responsibilities to the Plan\xe2\x80\x9d or assuming liability for Blue Cross\xe2\x80\x99 withholding of the data from Vermont.  <i>Liberty Mut.

The District Court then concluded that the State\xe2\x80\x99s reporting scheme was not pre-empted.  Although that scheme \xe2\x80\x9cmay have some indirect effect on health benefit plans,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned that the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect is so peripheral that the regulation cannot be considered an attempt to interfere with the administration or structure of a welfare benefit plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.  The panel was unanimous in concluding that respondent had standing, but it divided on the merits of the pre-emption challenge.  The panel majority explained that \xe2\x80\x9cone of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s core functions\xe2\x80\x94reporting\xe2\x80\x94[cannot] be laden with burdens, subject to incompatible, multiple and variable demands, and freighted with risk of fines, breach of duty, and legal expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  746 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 510.  The Vermont regime, the court held, does just that.  <i>Id.,</i> at 508\xe2\x80\x93510.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court granted certiorari to address the important issue of ERISA pre-emption.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause is the necessary starting point.

In <i>Travelers, </i>the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f \xe2\x80\x98relate to\xe2\x80\x99 were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 655.  That is a result \xe2\x80\x9cno sensible person could have intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement</i> v. <i>Dillingham Constr., N.\xc2\xa0A., Inc.</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316,\n336 (1997)\n (Scalia, J., concurring).  So the need for workable standards has led the Court to reject \xe2\x80\x9cuncritical literalism\xe2\x80\x9d in applying the clause.  <i>Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 656.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Implementing these principles, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law to date has described two categories of state laws that ERISA pre-empts.  First, ERISA pre-empts a state law if it has a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reference to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA plans.  <i>Ibid.</i>  To be more precise, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here a State\xe2\x80\x99s law acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law\xe2\x80\x99s operation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , that \xe2\x80\x98reference\xe2\x80\x99 will result in pre-emption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dillingham</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 325.  Second, ERISA pre-empts a state law that has an impermissible \xe2\x80\x9cconnection with\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA plans, meaning a state law that \xe2\x80\x9cgoverns .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a central matter of plan administration\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinterferes with nationally uniform plan administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Egelhoff</i> v. <i>Egelhoff</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141,\n148 (2001)\n.  A state law also might have an impermissible connection with ERISA plans if \xe2\x80\x9cacute, albeit indirect, economic effects\xe2\x80\x9d of the state law \xe2\x80\x9cforce an ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Travelers</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 668.  When considered together, these formulations ensure that ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause receives the broad scope Congress intended while avoiding the clause\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility to limitless application.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent contends that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law falls in the second category of state laws that are pre-empted by ERISA: laws that govern, or interfere with the uniformity of, plan administration and so have an impermissible \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98connection with\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA plans.  <i>Egelhoff</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 148; <i>Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 656.  When presented with these contentions in earlier cases, the Court has considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid</i>., and \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Dillingham</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 325.  Here, those considerations lead the Court to conclude that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s regime, as applied to ERISA plans, is pre-empted.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ERISA does not guarantee substantive benefits.

The Court, in fact, has noted often that these requirements are integral aspects of ERISA.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Dillingham</i>, 519 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 327; <i>Travelers</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 651; <i>Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </i>at<i> </i>137; <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Morash</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107,\n113,\n115 (1989)\n; <i>Fort Halifax</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 9; <i>Metropolitan Life Ins.

These matters are fundamental components of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of plan administration.  Differing, or even parallel, regulations from multiple jurisdictions could create wasteful administrative costs and threaten to subject plans to wide-ranging liability.  See, <i>e.g., </i>18 V.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa79410(g) (supplying penalties for violation of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s reporting rules); CVR<i> </i>\xc2\xa710 (same).  Pre-emption is necessary to prevent the States from imposing novel, inconsistent, and burdensome reporting requirements on plans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Secretary of Labor, not the States, is authorized to administer the reporting requirements of plans governed by ERISA.  He may exempt plans from ERISA report-ing requirements altogether.  See \xc2\xa71024(a)(3); 29 CFR \xc2\xa72520.104\xe2\x80\x9344 (2005) (exempting self-insured health plans from the annual financial reporting requirement).  And, he may be authorized to require ERISA plans to report data similar to that which Vermont seeks, though that question is not presented here.  Either way, the uniform rule design of ERISA makes it clear that these decisions are for federal authorities, not for the separate States.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Vermont disputes the pre-emption of its reporting regime on several fronts.  The State argues that respondent has not demonstrated that the reporting regime in fact has caused it to suffer economic costs.  Brief for Petitioner 52\xe2\x80\x9354.  But respondent\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is not based on the theory that the State\xe2\x80\x99s law must be pre-empted solely because of economic burdens caused by the state law.  See <i>Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 668.  Respondent argues, rather, that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s scheme regulates a central aspect of plan administration and, if the scheme is not pre-empted, plans will face the possibility of a body of disuniform state reporting laws and, even if uniform, the necessity to accommodate multiple governmental agencies.  A plan need not wait to bring a pre-emption claim until confronted with numerous inconsistent obligations and encumbered with any ensuing costs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Vermont contends, furthermore, that ERISA does not pre-empt the state statute and regulation because the state reporting scheme has different objectives.  This Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he principal object of [ERISA] is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Boggs</i> v. <i>Boggs</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833,\n845 (1997)\n.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n enacting ERISA, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morash</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 115.  The State maintains that its program has nothing to do with the financial solvency of plans or the prudent behavior of fiduciaries.  See Brief for Petitioner 29.  This does not suffice to avoid federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[P]re-emption claims turn on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 655.  The purpose of a state law, then, is relevant only as it may relate to the \xe2\x80\x9cscope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 656, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Dillingham</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 325.  In <i>Travelers</i>, for example, the Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]oth the purpose and the effects of\xe2\x80\x9d the state law at issue \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguish[ed] it from\xe2\x80\x9d laws that \xe2\x80\x9cfunction as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658\xe2\x80\x93659.  The perceived difference here in the objectives of the Vermont law and ERISA does not shield Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s reporting regime from pre-emption.  Vermont orders health insurers, including ERISA plans, to report detailed information about the administration of benefits in a systematic manner.  This is a direct regulation of a fundamental ERISA function.  Any difference in purpose does not transform this direct regulation of \xe2\x80\x9ca central matter of plan administration,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Egelhoff</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 148, into an innocuous and peripheral set of additional rules.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Vermont regime cannot be saved by invoking the State\xe2\x80\x99s traditional power to regulate in the area of public health.  The Court in the past has \xe2\x80\x9caddressed claims of pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law,\xe2\x80\x9d in particular state laws regulating a subject of traditional state power.  <i>Travelers</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 654\xe2\x80\x93655.  ERISA, however, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly contemplated the pre-emption of substantial areas of traditional state regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dillingham</i>, 519 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 330.  ERISA pre-empts a state law that regulates a key facet of plan administration even if the state law exercises a traditional state power.  See <i>Egelhoff</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 151\xe2\x80\x93152.  The fact that reporting is a principal and essential feature of ERISA demonstrates that Congress intended to pre-empt state reporting laws like Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s, including those that operate with the purpose of furthering public health.  The analysis may be different when applied to a state law, such as a tax on hospitals, see <i>De Buono</i> v. <i>NYSA\xe2\x80\x93ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806 (1997)\n, the enforcement of which necessitates incidental reporting by ERISA plans; but that is not the law before the Court.  Any presumption against pre-emption, whatever its force in other instances, cannot validate a state law that enters a fundamental area of ERISA regulation and thereby counters the federal purpose in the way this state law does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent suggests that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which created new reporting obligations for employer-sponsored health plans and incorporated those requirements into the body of ERISA, further demonstrates that ERISA pre-empts Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s reporting regime.  See\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71185d; 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9315a, 17; \xc2\xa718031(e)(3).  The ACA, however, specified that it shall not \xe2\x80\x9cbe construed to preempt any State law that does not prevent the application of the provisions\xe2\x80\x9d of the ACA.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718041(d).  This anti-pre-emption provision might prevent any new ACA-created reporting obligations from pre-empting state reporting regimes like Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s, notwithstanding the incorporation of these requirements in the heart of ERISA.  But see\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71191(a)(2) (providing that the new ACA provisions shall not be construed to affect or modify the ERISA pre-emption clause as applied to group health plans);\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9323(a)(2) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has no need to resolve this issue.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping provisions\xe2\x80\x94upon which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion rests\xe2\x80\x94maintain their pre-emptive force whether or not the new ACA reporting obligations also pre-empt state law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause requires invalidation of the Vermont reporting statute as applied to ERISA plans.  The state statute imposes duties that are inconsistent with the central design of ERISA, which is to provide a single uniform national scheme for the administration of ERISA plans without interference from laws of the several States even when those laws, to a large extent, impose parallel requirements.

Doing so is likely to create serious administrative problems.  The Court points out that the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s plan provides benefits to over 80,000 individuals living in 50 different States.  See <i>ante,</i> at 3.  In addition, <i>amici curiae</i> tell us that self-insured, ERISA-based health plans provide benefits to 93 million Americans.  Brief for American Benefits Council et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8.  If each State is free to go its own way, each independently determining what information each plan must provide about benefits, the result could well be unnecessary, duplicative, and conflicting reporting requirements, any of which can mean increased confusion and increased cost.  Private standard setting can of course help alleviate these problems, but given the large number of different possible regulations, I do not believe that is sufficient.  Cf. A. Costello &amp; M. Taylor, APCD Council &amp; NAHDO, Standardization of Data Collection in All-Payer Claims Databases 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Jan. 2011), online at https://www.apcdcouncil.org\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0publication/standardization-data-collection-all-payer-claims-databases (as last visited Feb. 26, 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would also emphasize that pre-emption does not necessarily prevent Vermont or other States from obtaining the self-insured, ERISA-based health-plan information that they need.  States wishing to obtain information can ask the Federal Government for appropriate approval.  As the majority points out, the \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary of Labor has authority to establish additional reporting and disclosure requirements for ERISA plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8; see\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71135.  Moreover, the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9cis authorized to undertake research and surveys and in connection therewith to collect, compile, analyze and publish data, information, and statistics relating to employee benefit plans, including retirement, deferred compensation, and welfare plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71143(a)(1).  At least one other important statute provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with similar authority.  See\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9317(a) (part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is applicable to group health insurance plans including ERISA plans); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 4 (the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Treasury are \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently considering a rulemaking to require health plans to report more detailed information about various aspects of plan administration, such as enrollment, claims processing, and benefit offerings\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I see no reason why the Secretary of Labor could not develop reporting requirements that satisfy the States\xe2\x80\x99 needs, including some State-specific requirements, as appropriate.  Nor do I see why the Department could not delegate to a particular State the authority to obtain data related to that State, while also providing the data to the Federal Secretary for use by other States or at the federal level.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the need for federal approval or authorization limits to some degree the States\xe2\x80\x99 power to obtain information, requiring that approval has considerable advantages.  The federal agencies are more likely to be informed about, and to understand, ERISA-related consequences and health-care needs from a national perspective.  Their involvement may consequently secure for the States necessary information without unnecessarily creating costly conflicts\xe2\x80\x94particularly when compared with such alternatives as giving each State free rein to go its own way or asking nonexpert federal courts to try to iron out, regulation by regulation, such conflicts.

This conclusion falters for two primary reasons.  First, the reporting requirement imposed by the Vermont statute differs in kind from the \xe2\x80\x98reporting\xe2\x80\x99 that is required by ERISA and therefore was not the kind of state law Congress intended to preempt.  Second, Liberty Mutual has failed to show any actual burden, much less a burden that triggers ERISA preemption.

That law and ERISA serve different purposes.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s domain is the design and administration of employee benefit plans: notably, prescriptions on the vesting of benefits, claims processing, and the designation of beneficiaries.  See <i>Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 656 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Its reporting requirements, geared to those functions, ensure that the plans in fact provide covered benefits.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s data-collection statute, in contrast, aims to improve the quality and utilization, and reduce the cost, of health care in Vermont by providing consumers, government officials, and researchers with comprehensive data about the health care delivery system.

In support of this contention, Liberty points to dicta from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions and selections from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  See, <i>e.g., Travelers</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 661 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[S]ubject matters covered by ERISA [include] reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and the like.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Delta Air Lines, Inc.</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85,\n98 (1983)\n)); <i>Ingersoll-Rand Co.</i> v. <i>McClendon</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133,\n137 (1990)\n (ERISA \xe2\x80\x9csets various uniform standards, including rules concerning reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibility, for both pension and welfare plans.\xe2\x80\x9d); 120 Cong. Rec. 29942 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Javits) (\xe2\x80\x9cState laws compelling disclosure from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. plans .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will be superseded.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Far from unambiguously endorsing Liberty\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping view of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope, these statements can be read at least as reasonably for the unremarkable principle that ERISA preempts state reporting rules designed to serve the same purposes as ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s reporting requirements.  This more limited understanding is consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s admonition to pay close attention to the \xe2\x80\x9cobjectives of the ERISA statute as a guide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Egelhoff</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 147.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Satisfied that ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives do not require preemption of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s data-collection law, I turn to the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The imposition of some burdens on the administration of ERISA plans, the Court has held, does not suffice to require preemption.  See <i>De Buono</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 815.  While a law imposing costs so acute as to effectively dictate how a plan is designed or administered could trigger preemption, see <i>id.,</i> at 816, n.\xc2\xa016, no such extreme effects are present here.  Moreover, no \xe2\x80\x9ccentral matter of plan administration,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Egelhoff,</i> 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 148, is touched by Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s data-collection law.  That law prescribes no vesting requirements, benefit levels, beneficiary designations, or rules on how claims should be processed or paid.  Indeed, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s law does not require Liberty to do anything.  The burden of compliance falls on Blue Cross, which apparently provides the data without protest on behalf of other self-funded plans.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reporting and disclosure are no doubt required of ERISA plans, but those requirements are ancillary to the areas ERISA governs.  Reporting and recordkeeping incident to state laws of general applicability have been upheld as they bear on ERISA plans.  In <i>De Buono</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 809\xe2\x80\x93810, 816, for example, the Court held that a gross-receipts tax on patient services provided by a hospital operated by an ERISA plan was not preempted, even though administration of the tax required filing quarterly reports.  And in <i>Dillingham</i>, 519 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319, the Court held that California\xe2\x80\x99s prevailing-wage law was not preempted as applied to apprenticeship programs established by ERISA plans.  Prevailing-wage laws typically require employees to keep records of the wages paid to employees and make them available for review by state authorities.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71776 (West 1989) (prevailing-wage law in <i>Dillingham</i>).  The Second Circuit erred, then, in holding that ERISA preempts any state-law reporting obligation that is more than \xe2\x80\x9cslight.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 746 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 508\xe2\x80\x93509.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Vermont data-collection statute keeps company with the laws considered in <i>De Buono</i> and <i>Dillingham</i>: It is generally applicable and does not involve \xe2\x80\x9ca central matter of plan administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Egelhoff</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 148.

But state-law diversity is a hallmark of our political system and has been lauded in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions.

In <i>Egelhoff</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143\xe2\x80\x93144, a deceased ERISA-plan participant\xe2\x80\x99s ex-spouse challenged a state law that revoked her beneficiary status automatically upon her divorce, even though the ERISA plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms did not.  The Court held that ERISA preempted the law because it \xe2\x80\x9cbinds ERISA plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 147.  In that context, the Court said: \xe2\x80\x9cRequiring ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would undermine the congressional goal of minimizing the administrative and financial burdens on plan administrators\xe2\x80\x94burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 149\xe2\x80\x93150 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court took care, however, to confine <i>Egelhoff</i> to issues implicating \xe2\x80\x9ca central matter of plan administration,\xe2\x80\x9d in other words, \xe2\x80\x9ca core ERISA concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 147\xe2\x80\x93148.  What does that category comprise?  As earlier described, see <i>supra,</i> at 6, 11, prescriptions on benefit levels, beneficiary designations, vesting requirements, and rules on processing and payment of claims would rank under the central or core ERISA subject-matter rubric.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  So, too, would reporting and disclosure obligations, but of what kind?  Those that further regulation of the design and administration of employee benefit plans, <i>i.e., </i>reporting and disclosures tied to the areas ERISA governs.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s reporting and disclosure requirements are thus concerned with mismanagement of funds, failure to pay employee benefits, plan assets or allocations, all information bearing on the financial integrity of the plan.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s data-collection law, eliciting information on medical claims, services provided to beneficiaries, charges and payment for those services, and demographic makeup of those receiving benefits, does not fit the bill any more than reporting relating to a plan\xe2\x80\x99s taxes or wage payments does.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Numerous States have informed the Court of their urgent need for information yielded by their health care data-collection laws.

Wait until the Federal Government acts is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s response.  The Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s capacious grant of statutory authority, the Court observes, might allow it to collect the same data Vermont and other States seek about ERISA plan health-benefit payments.
