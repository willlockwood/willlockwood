In 2005, new driver Monika Starke filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission), alleging that she was sexually harassed by two male trainers during the road-trip portion of her training.  Following the procedures set out in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b), the Commission informed CRST about the charge and investigated the allegation, ultimately informing CRST that it had found reasonable cause to believe that CRST subjected Starke and \xe2\x80\x9ca class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d and offering to conciliate.  In 2007, having determined that conciliation had failed, the Commission, in its own name, filed suit against CRST under \xc2\xa7706 of Title VII.  During discovery, the Commission identified over 250 allegedly aggrieved women.  The District Court, however, dismissed all of the claims, including those on behalf of 67 women, which, the court found, were barred on the ground that the Commission had not adequately investigated or attempted to conciliate its claims on their behalf before filing suit.  The District Court then dismissed the suit, held that CRST is a prevailing party, and invited CRST to apply for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  CRST filed a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The District Court awarded the company over $4 million in fees.  The Eighth Circuit reversed the dismissal of only two claims\xe2\x80\x94on behalf of Starke and one other employee\xe2\x80\x94but that led it to vacate, without prejudice, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees award.  On remand, the Commission settled the claim on behalf of Starke and withdrew the other.  CRST again sought attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and the District Court again awarded it more than $4 million, finding that CRST had prevailed on the claims for over 150 of the allegedly aggrieved women, including the 67 claims dismissed because of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy its presuit requirements.  The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded once more.  It held that a Title VII defendant can be a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d only by obtaining a \xe2\x80\x9cruling on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the claims was not a ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant is a prevailing party.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot \xe2\x80\x9cprevail\xe2\x80\x9d unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.  A plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.  But a defendant seeks to prevent an alteration in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor, and that objective is fulfilled whenever the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, <i>i.e., </i>even if the court\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment rejects the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for a nonmerits reason.  There is no indication that Congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.  Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s fee-shifting statute allows prevailing defendants to recover whenever the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christiansburg Garment Co.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412\n.  Congress thus must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, whether on the merits or not.  <i>Christiansburg</i> itself involved a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a case where the District Court had rejected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for a non-merits reason.  Various Courts of Appeals likewise have applied the <i>Christiansburg</i> standard when claims were dismissed for nonmerits reasons.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Court declines to decide the argument, raised by the Commission for the first time during the merits stage of this case, whether a defendant must obtain a preclusive judgment in order to prevail.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to articulate its preclusion theory earlier has resulted in inadequate briefing on the issue, and the parties dispute whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was in fact preclusive.  The Commission also submits that the Court should affirm on the alternative ground that, even if CRST is a prevailing party, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s position that it had satisfied its presuit obligations was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  These matters are left for the Eighth Circuit to consider in the first instance.  It is not this Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance, see <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mineta</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n, and that is the proper course here, given the extensive record in this case and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s change of position between the certiorari and merits stages.

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n78 Stat.\n253, as amended,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, which prohibits discrimination in employment, a district court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(k).  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a Title VII defendant prevails only by obtaining a \xe2\x80\x9cruling on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  774 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169, 1179 (2014); <i>Marquart</i> v. <i>Lodge 837, Machinists and Aerospace Workers</i>, 26 F.\xc2\xa03d 842, 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (1994).  This Court disagrees with that conclusion.  The Court now holds that a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant has prevailed.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in certain circumstances.  The statute provides that</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(k).</p>\n<p>Before deciding whether an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is appropriate in a given case, then, a court must determine whether the party seeking fees has prevailed in the litigation.  <i>Texas State Teachers Assn.</i> v. <i>Garland Independent School Dist.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 782,\n789 (1989)\n; <i>Hensley</i> v. <i>Eckerhart</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424,\n433 (1983)\n.</p>\n<p>Congress has included the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in various fee-shifting statutes, and it has been the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to interpret the term in a consistent manner.  See <i>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</i> v. <i>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\n, and n.\xc2\xa04 (2001).  The Court has said that the \xe2\x80\x9ctouchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Texas State Teachers Assn.</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 792\xe2\x80\x93793.  This change must be marked by \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial <i>imprimatur</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Buckhannon</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 605.  The Court has explained that, when a plaintiff secures an \xe2\x80\x9cenforceable judgmen[t] on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-ordered consent decre[e],\xe2\x80\x9d that plaintiff is the prevailing party because he has received a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the par-ties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 604\xe2\x80\x93605.  The Court, however, has not set forth in detail how courts should determine whether a defendant has prevailed.</p>\n<p>Although the Court has not articulated a precise test for when a defendant is a prevailing party, in the Title VII context it has addressed how defendants should be treated under the second part of the inquiry\xe2\x80\x94whether the district court should exercise its discretion to award fees to the prevailing party.  When a defendant is the prevailing party on a civil rights claim, the Court has held, district courts may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless,\xe2\x80\x9d or if \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christiansburg Garment Co.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412,\n422 (1978)\n; see also <i>id.,</i> at 421.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination of the first part of the fee-shifting inquiry\xe2\x80\x94whether petitioner is a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x94presents the central issue in this case.  Before addressing this question, however, a discussion of the facts and complex procedural history is warranted.</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>Petitioner CRST is a trucking company that employs a team driving system under which two employees share driving duties on a single truck.  CRST requires its drivers to graduate from the company\xe2\x80\x99s training program before becoming a certified driver.  Part of that training is a 28-day over-the-road trip with a veteran driver.  In 2005, a new driver named Monika Starke filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission) alleging that two male trainers sexually harassed her during her over-the-road training trip.</p>\n<p>The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of a charge of an unlawful workplace practice starts Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed, multi-step procedure through which the Commission enforces the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on employment discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mach Mining, LLC</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 1).  Under \xc2\xa7706 of Title VII, the Commission first must inform the employer about the charge and the details of the allegations.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b).  The Commission next must investigate the allegation.  <i>Ibid.</i>  If the agency \xe2\x80\x9cdetermines after such investigation that there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,\xe2\x80\x9d it shall dismiss the charge and notify the parties.  <i>Ibid.</i>  At that point, the Commission is no longer involved, and the aggrieved individual may sue the employer in his or her own name.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1).  If, on the other hand, the Commission determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a Title VII violation did occur, it \xe2\x80\x9cshall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b).  Only if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at conciliation fails may it file a court action in its own name on behalf of the aggrieved person who brought the charge.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1).</p>\n<p>Following these procedures, the Commission notified CRST of Starke\xe2\x80\x99s charge and requested information regarding Starke\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  In response CRST denied any wrongdoing.  During the investigation, the Commission discovered that four other women had filed formal charges against the company with the Commission.  The Commission then sent CRST several followup requests.  It asked if CRST had received other allegations of harassment, demanded contact information for any women who were instructed by the trainers Starke accused of harassment, and sought \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed contact information for\xe2\x80\x9d CRST\xe2\x80\x99s dispatchers and female drivers.  <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>CRST Van Expedited, Inc.</i>, 679 F.\xc2\xa03d 657, 667 (CA8 2012).</p>\n<p>Over a year and a half after Starke filed her charge, the Commission sent CRST a letter of determination informing the company that the Commission had found reason-able cause to believe that CRST subjected Starke and \xe2\x80\x9ca class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d and offering to conciliate.  App. 811.  Counsel for the Commission and for CRST discussed conciliation, but were unable to reach an agreement, and the Commission promptly notified the company that, in the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view, the conciliation efforts had failed.</p>\n<p>In September 2007 the Commission, in its own name, filed suit against CRST under \xc2\xa7706 of Title VII.  It alleged that CRST subjected Starke and \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther similarly situated .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. employees of CRST .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to sexual harassment and a sexually hostile and offensive work environment\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 and 2000e\xe2\x80\x933.  App. 794\xe2\x80\x93795.  The Commission is allowed to \xe2\x80\x9cseek specific relief for a group of aggrieved individuals [under \xc2\xa7706] without first obtaining class certification pursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, because that rule \xe2\x80\x9cis not applicable to\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa7706 enforcement action.  <i>General Telephone Co. of Northwest</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>,\n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 318\n\xe2\x80\x93334 (1980).  The Commission sought to enjoin CRST from engaging in discriminatory employment practices and to obtain an order requiring CRST to take proactive steps to remedy and prevent sex-based discrimination in the workplace.  The Commission also sought damages and costs.</p>\n<p>During discovery, the Commission identified over 250 allegedly aggrieved women\xe2\x80\x94far more than the Commission had forecast.  CRST filed a motion for an order to show cause, alleging that the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have a good-faith basis\xe2\x80\x9d for seeking relief on behalf of all the women.  <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>CRST Van Expedited, Inc.</i>, 2009 WL 2524402, *10 (ND Iowa, Aug. 13, 2009).  The District Court did not strike any allegedly aggrieved persons at that time, although it did note its concern \xe2\x80\x9cthat CRST still might unfairly face a \xe2\x80\x98moving target\xe2\x80\x99 of prospective plaintiffs as discovery winds down and trial approaches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The District Court proceeded to dispose of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s claims in a series of orders responsive to various motions filed by CRST.  Section 707 of Title VII authorizes the Commission to bring a claim \xe2\x80\x9cthat any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice\xe2\x80\x9d of illegal sex-based discrimination.  See\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x936.  In the early stage of this litigation the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cmade clear to the [district] court and CRST that it believe[d] CRST had engaged in \xe2\x80\x98a pattern or practice\xe2\x80\x99 of tolerating sexual harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order in No. 07\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9395 (ND Iowa), Doc. 197, p. 25.  CRST sought summary judgment on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s perceived pattern-or-practice claim.  The District Court granted the motion.  The court explained that, although courts have allowed the Commission to use a pattern-or-practice theory when litigating a \xc2\xa7706 claim, the Commission did not plead a violation of \xc2\xa7707 or use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpattern or practice\xe2\x80\x9d in its complaint.  <i>Id.,</i> at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  Instead, the \xe2\x80\x9c[Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] Complaint reads as if the [Commission] were asserting a prototypical \xc2\xa7706 action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But, the court noted, CRST did not argue that the Commission failed to state a pattern-or-practice claim in the complaint; and the court presumed that CRST would not have sought summary judgment on a claim \xe2\x80\x9cit does not believe to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 26.  Because both parties accepted that the claim was live, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court assume[d] without deciding that this is a sexual harassment pattern or practice case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  After reviewing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, the court held that the Commission had \xe2\x80\x9cnot established a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d and dismissed with prejudice the assumed pattern-or-practice claim.  <i>Id.,</i> at 67.  The court, as a final matter, advised that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in this opinion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. should be construed as a final ruling on the individual claims of sexual harassment that the [Commission] presses in this action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Next, the District Court ruled in several orders that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s claims on behalf of all but 67 of the women were barred on a variety of grounds.  The court had previously dismissed claims on behalf of nearly 100 women as a discovery sanction due to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to produce the women for deposition.  In rejecting the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s other claims, the court relied on (1) the expiration of the statute of limitations; (2) judicial estoppel; (3) the employee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to report the alleged harassment in a timely fashion; (4) CRST\xe2\x80\x99s prompt and effective response to reports of harassment; and (5) the lack of severity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassment.</p>\n<p>The District Court then barred the Commission from seeking relief for the remaining 67 women on the ground that the Commission had not satisfied its \xc2\xa7706 presuit requirements before filing the lawsuit.  The court concluded that the suit was \xe2\x80\x9cone of those exceptionally rare\xe2\x80\x9d cases where the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cwholly abandoned its statutory duties\xe2\x80\x9d to investigate and conciliate.  <i>CRST Van Expedited, Inc.</i>, 2009 WL 2524402, at *16.  The court noted, how-ever, that it \xe2\x80\x9cexpresse[d] no view as to whether the [Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] investigation, determination and conciliation of Starke\xe2\x80\x99s Charge would be sufficient to support a pattern[-]or-practice lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.,</i> n.\xc2\xa021.  The District Court then dismissed the suit, held that CRST is a prevailing party, and invited CRST to apply for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p>CRST filed a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  After describing how it disposed of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s claims piece by piece, the District Court held that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy its presuit obligations for its claims on behalf of the final 67 women was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and that an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees was therefore appropriate.  App. 140.  The court awarded CRST over $4 million in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  <i>Id.,</i> at 173\xe2\x80\x93174.</p>\n<p>The Commission appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order dismissing the claims on behalf of the 67 women that the District Court rejected for failure to satisfy Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s presuit requirements as well as the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of some of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s other claims.  As relevant here, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the 67 claims for a lack of investigation and conciliation was proper.  The Commission, according to the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not reasonably investigate the class allegations of sexual harassment during a reasonable investigation of the charge,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather used \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery in the resulting lawsuit as a fishing expedition to uncover more violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CRST Van Expedited, Inc.</i>, 679 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 676 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Commission in fact \xe2\x80\x9cdid not investigate the specific allegations of <i>any</i> of the 67 allegedly aggrieved persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. until <i>after</i> the Complaint was filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of almost all of the other claims on which the Commission had appealed, reversing only the claims on behalf of Starke and one other employee\xe2\x80\x94Tillie Jones\xe2\x80\x94 for reasons not material to the question at issue here.  Like the District Court before it, the Court of Appeals declined to comment on whether the presuit investigation and attempted conciliation would have been sufficient to support a pattern-or-practice claim.  The Court of Appeals also vacated, without prejudice, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees award.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn light of our reversals\xe2\x80\x9d of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s summary-judgment orders with respect to Starke and Jones, the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cCRST is no longer a \xe2\x80\x98prevailing\xe2\x80\x99 defendant because the [Commission] still asserts live claims against it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 694\xe2\x80\x93695.  Judge Murphy dissented from the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Commission had failed to satisfy its obligation to investigate and conciliate the final 67 claims, arguing that the Commission did not need to \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete its presuit duties for each individual alleged victim of discrimination when pursuing a class claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 695.</p>\n<p>After the case was remanded, the Commission withdrew its claim on behalf of Jones and settled its claim on behalf of Starke.  The Commission thus had no claims left.  The company again moved for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and the District Court again awarded CRST more than $4 million in fees.  The court first concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthat this case contained multiple and distinct claims for relief,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby rejecting the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s contention that it had brought a single claim on which it had prevailed.  2013 WL 3984478, *9 (ND Iowa, Aug. 1, 2013).  Noting that the defendant does not have to prevail on every claim in a suit to obtain attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, see <i>Fox</i> v. <i>Vice</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 826 (2011)\n, the court then determined the claims on which CRST had prevailed.  Applying Circuit precedent requiring a ruling on the merits of a claim before a defendant can be considered a prevailing party, the court found that CRST did not prevail on the claims that were dismissed because of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to produce many of the allegedly aggrieved women for deposition.  The court also found that CRST had not prevailed on the merits with respect to a handful of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s other claims.  The court found that CRST did prevail, however, on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s pattern-or-practice claim and on the claims on behalf of over 150 of the allegedly aggrieved women, including the 67 claims dismissed because of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy its presuit requirements.  The court held that its dismissal of those 67 claims was a ruling on the merits because the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to investigate and conciliate \xe2\x80\x9cis not a jurisdictional prerequisite; rather, it is an ingredient of the [Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  2013 WL 3984478, at *10.  The court further concluded that an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees was appropriate because the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate and conciliate those 67 claims was unreasonable, as were the pattern-or-practice claim and the other claims on which it prevailed.</p>\n<p>The Commission appealed, and the Court of Appeals again reversed and remanded.  The Court of Appeals first agreed with the District Court that the Commission brought many individual claims, not just a single claim.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, however, with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that CRST could recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the pattern-or-practice claim.  The Commission did not allege a pattern-or-practice claim in its complaint, the Court of Appeals noted, and the District Court had \xe2\x80\x9cmerely <i>assumed without deciding</i> that the [Commission]brought a pattern-or-practice claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  774 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1179.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court erred by awarding fees \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a purported\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, bound by its own precedent in <i>Marquart</i>, then held that before a defendant can be deemed to have prevailed and to be eligible for fees there must have been a favorable \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial determination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the merits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  774 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1179 (quoting <i>Marquart</i>, 26 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 852).  A merits-based disposition is necessary, the court reasoned, because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]roof that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case is frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless is not possible without a judicial determination of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case on the merits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  774 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1179 (quoting <i>Marquart</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 852).  A case has not been decided on the merits, according to the Court of Appeals, if the defendant secured a \xe2\x80\x9cdismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on res judicata grounds, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on statute-of-limitations grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d or for something similar.  774 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1179.  The Court of Appeals distinguished \xe2\x80\x9cclaim elements,\xe2\x80\x9d on the one hand, from \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional prerequisites or nonjurisdictional prerequisites to filing suit,\xe2\x80\x9d on the other.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1180.  As relevant here, the court held that because Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s presuit requirements are not elements of a Title VII claim, the dismissal of the claims regarding the 67 women on the ground that the Commission failed to investigate or conciliate was not a ruling on the merits, and CRST did not prevail on those claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1181.  As a result, the court concluded, CRST was \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to an award of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees on such claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court for \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] a universal finding that all of the [Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] claims were without foundation,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of laying out \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized findings .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as to each individual claim upon which it granted summary judgment on the merits to CRST.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1183.  Such findings are necessary, the court reasoned, to avoid providing the defendant with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98compensation for any fees that he would have paid in the absence of the frivolous claims.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Fox</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 841).  In particular, the court found it \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s blanket finding included \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the purported pattern-or-practice claim and (2) the claims dismissed for the [Commission\xe2\x80\x99s] failure to satisfy its presuit obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  774 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1183.  The District Court was ordered to undertake a proper, particularized inquiry on remand.</p>\n<p>By precluding the defendant from recovering attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when the claims in question have been dismissed because the Commission failed to satisfy its presuit obligations, the decision of the Court of Appeals conflicts with the decisions of three other Courts of Appeals.  See <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Propak Logistics, Inc.</i>, 746 F.\xc2\xa03d 145, 152\xe2\x80\x93154 (CA4 2014); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Asplundh Tree Expert Co.</i>, 340 F.\xc2\xa03d 1256, 1261 (CA11 2003); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Pierce Packing Co.</i>, 669 F.\xc2\xa02d 605, 608\xe2\x80\x93609 (CA9 1982).  This Court granted certiorari.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that CRST did not prevail on the claims brought on behalf of 67 women because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of these claims for failure to investigate and conciliate was not a ruling on the merits.  In this Court the Commission now takes the position that the court erred by applying an on-the-merits requirement.  Brief for Respondent 29 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]sking whether a judgment is \xe2\x80\x98on the merits\xe2\x80\x99 in some abstract sense risks confusion\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have abandoned the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that you need a disposition on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court agrees and now holds that a defendant need not obtain a favorable judgment on the merits in order to be a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot \xe2\x80\x9cprevail\xe2\x80\x9d unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.  Plaintiffs and defendants come to court with different objectives.  A plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.  A defendant seeks to prevent this alteration to the extent it is in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The defendant, of course, might prefer a judgment vindicating its position regarding the substantive merits of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.  The defendant has, however, fulfilled its primary objective whenever the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The defendant may prevail even if the court\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment rejects the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for a nonmerits reason.</p>\n<p>There is no indication that Congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.  The congressional policy regarding the exercise of district court discretion in the ultimate decision whether to award fees does not distinguish between merits-based and non-merits-based judgments.  Rather, as the Court explained in <i>Christiansburg Garment Co.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>, one purpose of the fee-shifting provision is \xe2\x80\x9cto deter the bringing of lawsuits without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 420 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Fox</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 836 (noting, in the context of\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x99s closely related provision, that Congress wanted \xe2\x80\x9cto relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court, therefore, has interpreted the statute to allow prevailing defendants to recover whenever the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christiansburg</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 422.  It would make little sense if Congress\xe2\x80\x99 policy of \xe2\x80\x9csparing defendants from the costs of <i>frivolous</i> litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Fox</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 840, depended on the distinction between merits-based and non-merits-based frivolity.  Congress must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, whether on the merits or not.  Imposing an on-the-merits requirement for a defendant to obtain prevailing party status would undermine that congressional policy by blocking a whole category of defendants for whom Congress wished to make fee awards available.</p>\n<p><i>Christiansburg</i> itself involved a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a case where the District Court had rejected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for a nonmerits reason.  That case involved a claim under Title VII, as originally enacted, which did not give the Commission the authority to sue in its own name on behalf of an aggrieved person.  Rosa Helm had filed a charge of discrimination against Christiansburg Garment Co. with the Commission in 1968.  A few years later, the Commission determined that its conciliation efforts had failed and told Helm of her right to sue Christiansburg, which she did not exercise.  Then in 1972, Congress amended Title VII to allow the Commission to sue in its own name on behalf of an aggrieved person, including where the employee\xe2\x80\x99s charge was \xe2\x80\x9cpending with the Commission\xe2\x80\x9d when the amendments took effect.  Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, \xc2\xa714,\n\n86Stat.\n103.  The Commission sued Christiansburg based on Helm\xe2\x80\x99s charge, but the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the ground that the charge was not pending on the amendments\xe2\x80\x99 effective date.  <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Christiansburg Garment Co.</i>, 376 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1067, 1073\xe2\x80\x931074 (WD Va. 1974).  This Court was asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhat standard should inform a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in deciding whether to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a successful defendant in a Title VII action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christiansburg</i>, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 417 (emphasis deleted).  If a ruling on the merits were necessary for the defendant to prevail and be eligible for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, the lack of a ruling on the merits would have been dispositive to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  But the Court said nothing to suggest that the fact that the ruling was not on the merits ended the inquiry.  Its reasoning was to the contrary.  This Court noted with approval that the District Court had applied the correct standard and found that the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission\xe2\x80\x99s statutory interpretation of \xc2\xa714 of the 1972 amendments was not frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 424 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Various Courts of Appeals likewise have applied the <i>Christiansburg</i> standard when claims were dismissed for nonmerits reasons.  A plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim may be frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless if the claim is barred by state sovereign immunity, <i>C. W.</i> v. <i>Capistrano Unified School Dist.</i>, 784 F.\xc2\xa03d 1237, 1247\xe2\x80\x931248 (CA9 2015), or is moot, <i>Propak Logistics,</i> 746 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 152.  See also Brief for Petitioner 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (collecting Courts of Appeals cases in which the defendant received attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was not on the merits).  In cases like these, significant attorney time and expenditure may have gone into contesting the claim.  Congress could not have intended to bar defendants from obtaining attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in these cases on the basis that, although the litigation was resolved in their favor, they were nonetheless not prevailing parties.  Neither the text of the fee-shifting statute nor the policy which underpins it counsels in favor of adopting the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 on-the-merits requirement.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>Having abandoned its defense of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, the Commission now urges this Court to hold that a defendant must obtain a preclusive judgment in order to prevail.  The Court declines to decide this issue, however.  The Commission changed its argument between the certiorari and merits stages.  As a result, the Commission may have forfeited the preclusion argument by not raising it earlier.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to articulate its preclusion theory before the eleventh hour has resulted in inadequate briefing on the issue.  The Commission and CRST dispute, moreover, whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was in fact preclusive.  Compare Brief for Respondent 38\xe2\x80\x9345 with Reply Brief 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  The Court leaves these legal and factual issues for the Court of Appeals to consider in the first instance.</p>\n<p>The Commission submits the Court should affirm on the alternative ground that, even if CRST is a prevailing party, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s position that it had satisfied its presuit obligations was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  The Commission acknowledges that the Court of Appeals has not decided this issue, but nevertheless invokes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to affirm \xe2\x80\x9con any ground properly raised below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation</i>,\n\n439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463\n, n.\xc2\xa020 (1979); see Brief for Respondent 4950.  In light of this case\xe2\x80\x99s intricate procedural history, see <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x9311, this is not an appropriate case to reach and settle this fact-sensitive issue.</p>\n<p>It has been over 10 years since Starke first filed her charge and close to 9 years since the Commission filed its complaint.  The dispute over the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees has continued over much of that period and is still unresolved.  When it appeared the litigation was coming to a close in the District Court, the trial judge considered this a case in which attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should be assessed against the Commission.  The Court of Appeals then made the rulings it considered proper in response, and there were further proceedings in the trial court and once again on appeal.  Against this background of protracted and expensive litigation on the fee issue, the Court is aware of the need to resolve the outstanding issues without unnecessary delay.  As the Court has noted in earlier cases, \xe2\x80\x9cthe determination of fees \xe2\x80\x98should not result in a second major litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fox</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 838 (quoting <i>Hensley</i>, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 437).</p>\n<p>It is not prudent, however, for the Court to attempt to resolve all the pending issues under the circumstances here.  It is not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance.  See <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mineta</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,\n110 (2001)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is a court of final review and not first view\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That precept is applicable here, especially in light of the extensive record in the case and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s change in its position.  This Court is confident that the Court of Appeals, and, if necessary, the District Court, will resolve the case by taking any proper steps to expedite its resolution in a manner consistent with their own procedures and their responsibilities in other pending cases.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3574265">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x931375</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">CRST VAN EXPEDITED, INC., PETITIONER <i>v.</i> EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[May 19, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, concurring.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a district court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(k).
