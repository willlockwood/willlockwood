When Officers Nolan and Harvey caught up with him on the street, Nolan stopped him and conducted a protective patdown search for weapons because in his experience there were usually weapons in the vicinity of narcotics transactions. Discovering a handgun, the officers arrested Wardlow. The Illinois trial court denied his motion to suppress, finding the gun was recovered during a lawful stop and frisk. He was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon.

While "reasonable suspicion" is a less demanding standard than probable cause, there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stop. An individual\'s presence in a "high crime area," standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion of criminal activity, but a location\'s characteristics are relevant in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation, <i>Adams </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/case.html">407 U.

Two of the officers caught up with him, stopped him, and conducted a protective patdown search for weapons. Discovering a .38-caliber handgun, the officers arrested Wardlow. We hold that the officers\' stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p><p>On September 9, 1995, Officers Nolan and Harvey were working as uniformed officers in the special operations section of the Chicago Police Department. The officers were driving the last car of a four-car caravan converging on an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking in order to investigate drug transactions. The officers were traveling together because they expected to find a crowd of people in the area, including lookouts and customers.</p><p>As the caravan passed 4035 West Van Buren, Officer Nolan observed respondent Wardlow standing next to the building</p><p><i>Alan </i>G. <i>Lance </i>of Idaho, <i>Carla </i><i>J. </i><i>Stovall </i>of Kansas, <i>Richard P.

Nolan and Harvey turned their car southbound, watched him as he ran through the gangway and an alley, and eventually cornered him on the street. Nolan then exited his car and stopped respondent. He immediately conducted a protective patdown search for weapons because in his experience it was common for there to be weapons in the near vicinity of narcotics transactions. During the frisk, Officer Nolan squeezed the bag respondent was carrying and felt a heavy, hard object similar to the shape of a gun. The officer then opened the bag and discovered a .38-caliber handgun with five live rounds of ammunition. The officers arrested Wardlow.</p><p>The Illinois trial court denied respondent\'s motion to suppress, finding the gun was recovered during a lawful stop and frisk. App. 14. Following a stipulated bench trial, Wardlow was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed Wardlow\'s conviction, concluding that the gun should have been suppressed because Officer Nolan did not have reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify an investigative stop pursuant to <i>Terry </i>v. <i>Ohio, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html">392 U. S. 1</a> (1968). 287 Ill. App. 3d 367, 678 N. E. 2d 65 (1997).</p><p>The Illinois Supreme Court agreed. 183 Ill. 2d 306, 701 N. E. 2d 484 (1998). While rejecting the Appellate Court\'s conclusion that Wardlow was not in a high crime area, the Illinois Supreme Court determined that sudden flight in such an area does not create a reasonable suspicion justifying a <i>Terry </i>stop. 183 Ill. 2d, at 310, 701 N. E. 2d, at 486. Relying on <i>Florida </i>v. <i>Royer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html">460 U. S. 491</a> (1983), the court explained that although police have the right to approach individuals and ask questions, the individual has no obligation to respond. The person may decline to answer and simply go on his or her way, and the refusal to respond, alone, does not provide a legitimate basis for an investigative stop. 183 Ill.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="123">123</a></p><p>2d, at 311-312, 701 N. E. 2d, at 486-487. The court then determined that flight may simply be an exercise of this right to "go on one\'s way," and, thus, could not constitute reasonable suspicion justifying a <i>Terry </i>stop. 183 Ill. 2d, at 312, 701 N. E. 2d, at 487.</p><p>The Illinois Supreme Court also rejected the argument that flight combined with the fact that it occurred in a high crime area supported a finding of reasonable suspicion because the "high crime area" factor was not sufficient standing alone to justify a <i>Terry </i>stop. Finding no independently suspicious circumstances to support an investigatory detention, the court held that the stop and subsequent arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. We granted certiorari, 526 U. S. 1097 (1999), and now reverse.1</p><p>This case, involving a brief encounter between a citizen and a police officer on a public street, is governed by the analysis we first applied in <i>Terry. </i>In <i>Terry, </i>we held that an officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. 392 U. S., at 30. While "reasonable suspicion" is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sokolow, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/1/case.html">490 U. S. 1</a>, 7 (1989). The officer must be able</p><p>1 The state courts have differed on whether unprovoked flight is sufficient grounds to constitute reasonable suspicion. See, <i>e. g., State </i>v. <i>Anderson, </i>155 Wis. 2d 77, 454 N. W. 2d 763 (1990) (flight alone is sufficient); <i>Platt </i>v. <i>State, </i>589 N.

App.8. It was in this context that Officer Nolan decided to investigate Wardlow after observing him flee. An individual\'s presence in an area of expected criminal activity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime. <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Texas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/47/case.html">443 U. S. 47</a> (1979). But officers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation. Accordingly, we have previously noted the fact that the stop occurred in a "high crime area" among the relevant contextual considerations in a <i>Terry </i>analysis. <i>Adams </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/case.html">407 U. S. 143</a>, 144, 147-148 (1972).</p><p>In this case, moreover, it was not merely respondent\'s presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking that aroused the officers\' suspicion, but his unprovoked flight upon noticing the police. Our cases have also recognized that nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Brignoni-Ponce, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/873/case.html">422 U. S. 873</a>, 885 (1975); <i>Florida </i>v. <i>Rodriguez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/1/case.html">469 U. S. 1</a>, 6 <i>(1984) </i><i>(per curiam); United States </i>v. <i>Sokolow, supra, </i>at 8-9. Headlong flight-wherever it occurs-is the consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such. In reviewing the propriety of an officer\'s conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn from suspicious</p><p>2We granted certiorari solely on the question whether the initial stop was supported by reasonable suspicion. Therefore, we express no opinion as to the lawfulness of the frisk independently of the stop.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="125">125</a></p><p>behavior, and we cannot reasonably demand scientific certainty from judges or law enforcement officers where none exists. Thus, the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cortez, 449 </i>U. S. 411, 418 (1981). We conclude Officer Nolan was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in criminal activity, and, therefore, in investigating further.</p><p>Such a holding is entirely consistent with our decision in <i>Florida </i>v. <i>Royer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/case.html">460 U. S. 491</a> (1983), where we held that when an officer, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, approaches an individual, the individual has a right to ignore the police and go about his business. <i>Id., </i>at 498. And any "refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure." <i>Florida </i>v. <i>Bostick, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/429/case.html">501 U. S. 429</a>, 437 (1991). But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate. Flight, by its very nature, is not "going about one\'s business"; in fact, it is just the opposite. Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent with the individual\'s right to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police questioning.</p><p>Respondent and <i>amici </i>also argue that there are innocent reasons for flight from police and that, therefore, flight is not necessarily indicative of ongoing criminal activity. This fact is undoubtedly true, but does not establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Even in <i>Terry, </i>the conduct justifying the stop was ambiguous and susceptible of an innocent explanation. The officer observed two individuals pacing back and forth in front of a store, peering into the window and periodically conferring. 392 U. S., at 5-6. All of this conduct was by itself lawful, but it also suggested that the individuals were casing the store for a planned robbery. <i>Terry </i>recognized that the officers could detain the individuals to resolve the ambiguity. <i>Id., </i>at 30.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="126">126</a></p><p>Opinion of STEVENS, J.</p><p>In allowing such detentions, <i>Terry </i>accepts the risk that officers may stop innocent people. Indeed, the Fourth Amendment accepts that risk in connection with more drastic police action; persons arrested and detained on probable cause to believe they have committed a crime may turn out to be innocent. The <i>Terry </i>stop is a far more minimal intrusion, simply allowing the officer to briefly investigate further. If the officer does not learn facts rising to the level of probable cause, the individual must be allowed to go on his way. But in this case the officers found respondent in possession of a handgun, and arrested him for violation of an Illinois firearms statute. No question of the propriety of the arrest itself is before us.</p><p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>The State of Illinois asks this Court to announce a "bright-line rule" authorizing the temporary detention of anyone who flees at the mere sight of a police officer. Brief for Petitioner 7-36. Respondent counters by asking us to adopt the opposite <i>per se </i>rule-that the fact that a person flees upon seeing the police can never, by itself, be sufficient to justify a temporary investigative stop of the kind authorized by <i>Terry </i>v. <i>Ohio, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html">392 U. S. 1</a> (1968). Brief for Respondent 6-31.</p><p>The Court today wisely endorses neither <i>per se </i>rule. Instead, it rejects the proposition that "flight is ... necessarily indicative of ongoing criminal activity," <i>ante, </i>at 125, adhering to the view that "[t]he concept of reasonable suspicion ... is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules," but must be determined by looking to "the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="127">127</a></p><p>totality of the circumstances-the whole picture," <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sokolow, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/1/case.html">490 U.

Abiding by this framework, the Court concludes that "Officer Nolan was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in criminal activity." <i>Ante, </i>at 125.</p><p>Although I agree with the Court\'s rejection of the <i>per se </i>rules proffered by the parties, unlike the Court, I am persuaded that in this case the brief testimony of the officer who seized respondent does not justify the conclusion that he had reasonable suspicion to make the stop. Before discussing the specific facts of this case, I shall comment on the parties\' requests for a <i>per se </i>rule.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>In <i>Terry </i>v. <i>Ohio, </i>we first recognized "that a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest," 392 U.

The inference we can reasonably draw about the motivation for a person\'s flight, rather, will depend on a number of different circumstances.

The phrase "upon seeing," as used by Illinois, apparently assumes that the flight is motivated by the presence of the police officer. 5 Illinois contends that unprovoked flight is "an extreme reaction," <i>id., </i>at 8, because innocent people simply do not "flee at the mere sight of the police," <i>id., </i>at 24. To be sure, Illinois concedes, an innocent person-even one distrustful of the police-might "avoid eye contact or even sneer at the sight of an officer," and that</p><p>4 Of course, <i>Terry </i>itself recognized that sometimes behavior giving rise to reasonable suspicion is entirely innocent, but it accepted the risk that officers may stop innocent people. 392 U.

And as the Court correctly observes, it is "undoubtedly true" that innocent explanations for flight exist, but they do not "establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment." <i>Ante, </i>at 125. It is equally true, however, that the innocent explanations make the single act of flight sufficiently ambiguous to preclude the adoption of a <i>per se </i>rule.</p><p>In <i>Terry, </i>furthermore, reasonable suspicion was supported by a concatenation of acts, each innocent when viewed in isolation, that when considered collectively amounted to extremely suspicious behavior. See 392 U. S., at 5-7, 22-23. Flight alone, however, is not at all like a "series of acts, each of them perhaps innocent in itself, but which taken together warran[t] further investigation." <i>Id., </i>at 22. Nor is flight similar to evidence which in the aggregate provides "fact on fact and clue on clue afford[ing] a basis for the deductions and inferences," supporting reasonable suspicion. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cortez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/411/case.html">449 U.

At oral argument, Illinois explained that if officers precipitate a flight by threats of violence, that flight is "provoked."

Flight to escape police detection, we have said, may have an entirely innocent motivation:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[I]t is a matter of common knowledge that men who are entirely innocent do sometimes fly from the scene of a crime through fear of being apprehended as the guilty parties, or from an unwillingness to appear as witnesses. Nor is it true as an accepted axiom of criminal law that \'the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.\' Innocent men sometimes hesitate to confront a jury-not necessarily because they fear that the jury will not protect them, but because they do not wish their names to appear in connection with criminal acts, are humiliated at being obliged to incur the popular odium of an arrest and trial, or because they do not wish to be put to the annoyance or expense of defending themselves." <i>Alberty </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/162/499/case.html">162 U.

And where there is criminal activity there is also a substantial element of danger-either from the criminal or from a confrontation between the criminal and the police. These considerations can lead to an innocent and understandable desire to quit the vicinity with all speed.6</p><p>6 Statistical studies of bystander victimization are rare.

Forcing young men to lower their trousers, or otherwise searching inside their underwear, on public streets or in public hallways, is so demeaning and invasive of fundamental precepts of privacy that it can only be condemned in the strongest terms.

This conclusion does not, as Illinois suggests, "establish a separate <i>Terry </i>analysis based on the individual characteristics of the person seized." Reply Brief for Petitioner 14.

Sometimes those inferences are entirely consistent with the presumption of innocence, sometimes they justify further investigation, and sometimes they justify an immediate stop and search for weapons. These considerations have led us to avoid categorical rules concerning a person\'s flight and the presumptions to be drawn therefrom:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Few things ... distinguish an enlightened system of judicature from a rude and barbarous one more than the manner in which they deal with evidence. The former weighs testimony, whilst the latter, conscious perhaps of its inability to do so or careless of the consequences of error, at times rejects whole portions <i>en masse, </i>and at others converts pieces of evidence into rules of law by investing with conclusive effect some whose probative force has been found to be in general considerable ....

While the innocent explanations surely do not establish that the Fourth Amendment is always violated whenever someone is stopped solely on the basis of an unprovoked flight, neither do the suspicious motivations establish that the Fourth Amendment is never violated when a <i>Terry </i>stop is predicated on that fact alone.

Burrill, Circumstantial Evidence 472 (1856) ("So impressed was the old common law with considerations of this kind, that it laid down the rule, which passed into a maxim,-that flight from justice was equivalent to confession of guilt ....

After the car turned south and intercepted respondent as he "ran right towards us," Officer Nolan stopped him and conducted a "protective search," which revealed that the bag under respondent\'s arm contained a loaded handgun. <i>Id., </i>at 9-11.</p><p>This terse testimony is most noticeable for what it fails to reveal. Though asked whether he was in a marked or unmarked car, Officer Nolan could not recall the answer. <i>Id., </i>at 4. He was not asked whether any of the other three cars in the caravan were marked, or whether any of the other seven officers were in uniform. Though he explained that the size of the caravan was because "[n]ormally in these different areas there\'s an enormous amount of people, sometimes lookouts, customers," Officer Nolan did not testify as to whether <i>anyone </i>besides Wardlow was nearby 4035 West Van Buren. Nor is it clear that that address was the intended destination of the caravan. As the Appellate Court of Illinois interpreted the record, "it appears that the officers were simply driving by, on their way to some unidentified location, when they noticed defendant standing at 4035 West Van Buren." 287 Ill. App. 3d 367, 370-371, 678 N. E. 2d 65, 67 (1997).16 Officer Nolan\'s testimony also does not reveal how fast the officers were driving. It does not indicate whether he saw respondent notice the other patrol cars. And it does not say whether the caravan, or any part of it, had already passed Wardlow by before he began to run.</p><p>Indeed, the Appellate Court thought the record was even "too vague to support the inference that ... defendant\'s flight was related to his expectation of police focus on him." <i>Id., </i>at 371, 678 N.

Though respondent was carrying a white, opaque bag under his arm, there is nothing at all suspicious about that. Certainly the time of day-shortly after noondoes not support Illinois\' argument. Nor were the officers "responding to any call or report of suspicious activity in the area." 183 Ill. 2d, at 315, 701 N. E. 2d, at 488. Officer Nolan did testify that he expected to find "an enormous amount of people," including drug customers or lookouts, App. 8, and the Court points out that "[i]t was in this context that Officer Nolan decided to investigate Wardlow after observing him flee," <i>ante, </i>at 124. This observation, in my view, lends insufficient weight to the reasonable suspicion analysis; indeed, in light of the absence of testimony that anyone else was nearby when respondent began to run, this observation points in the opposite direction.</p><p>The State, along with the majority of the Court, relies as well on the assumption that this flight occurred in a high crime area. Even if that assumption is accurate, it is insufficient because even in a high crime neighborhood unprovoked flight does not invariably lead to reasonable suspicion. On the contrary, because many factors providing innocent motivations for unprovoked flight are concentrated in high crime areas, the character of the neighborhood arguably makes an inference of guilt less appropriate, rather than more so. Like unprovoked flight itself, presence in a high crime neighborhood is a fact too generic and susceptible to innocent explanation to satisfy the reasonable suspicion inquiry.
