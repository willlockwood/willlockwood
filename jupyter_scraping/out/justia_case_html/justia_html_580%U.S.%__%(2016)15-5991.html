Shaw was convicted of violating\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(1), which makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly execut[e] a scheme\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defraud a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Subsection (1) of the bank fraud statute covers schemes to deprive a bank of money in a customer\xe2\x80\x99s deposit account.  Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in favor of his claim that subsection (1) does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor, not a bank, are unpersuasive.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">First, the bank did have property rights in Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s bank deposits: When a customer deposits funds, the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds, which the bank has a right to use as a source of loans that help the bank earn profits.  Sometimes, the contract between the customer and the bank provides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank only assumes possession; even then, the bank has a property interest in the funds because its role is akin to that of a bailee.  Hence, for purposes of the bank fraud statute, a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor\xe2\x80\x99s account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d at least where, as here, the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits, the funds obtained came from the deposit account, and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Second, Shaw may not have intended to cause the bank financial harm, but the statute, while insisting upon \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d demands neither a showing that the bank suffered ultimate financial loss nor a showing that the defendant intended to cause such loss.  This Court has found no case that interprets the statute as Shaw does.  Cf. <i>Carpenter</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19\n.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Third, that Shaw may have been ignorant of relevant bank-related property law is no defense to criminal prosecution for bank fraud.  Shaw knew that the bank possessed Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s account, Shaw made false statements to the bank, Shaw believed that those false statements would lead the bank to release from that account funds that ultimately and wrongfully ended up with Shaw, and the bank in fact possessed a property interest in the account.  These facts are sufficient to show that Shaw knew that he was entering into a scheme to defraud the bank even if he was not aware of the niceties of bank-related property law.  Cf. <i>Pasquantino</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349\n\xe2\x80\x93356. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Fourth, Shaw mistakenly contends that the statute requires the Government to prove not just that he acted with the <i>knowledge </i>that he would likely harm the bank\xe2\x80\x99s property interest but also that such was his <i>purpose.  </i>This Court has found no relevant authority supporting the view that a statute making criminal the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>knowin[g] </i>execut[ion of] a scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d requires something more than knowledge.  <i>Allison Engine Co.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel.

The petitioner, Lawrence Shaw, was convicted of violating this provision.  He argues here that the provision does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor, not a bank.  We do not accept his arguments.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The relevant criminal statute makes it a crime:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cknowingly [to] execut[e] a scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71344.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shaw obtained the identifying numbers of a Bank of America account belonging to a bank customer, Stanley Hsu.  Shaw used those numbers (and other related information) to transfer funds from Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s account to other accounts at other institutions from which Shaw could obtain (and eventually did obtain) Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s funds.  Shaw was convicted of violating the first clause of the statute, namely,the prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9cdefraud[ing] a financial insti-tution.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit affirmed his conviction.  781F. 3d 1130 (2015).  Shaw then filed a petition for certiorari arguing that the words \xe2\x80\x9cscheme to defraud a financial institution\xe2\x80\x9d require the Government to prove that the defendant had \xe2\x80\x9ca specific intent not only to deceive, but also to cheat, a<i> bank</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ca <i>non-bank</i> third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  We granted review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Shaw makes several related arguments in favor of his basic claim, namely, that the statute does not cover schemes to deprive a bank of customer deposits.  First, he says that subsection (1) requires \xe2\x80\x9can intent to wrong a victim bank [a \xe2\x80\x98financial institution\xe2\x80\x99] <i>in its property rights\xc2\xa0</i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i> Brief for Petitioner 23.  He adds that the property he took, money in Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s bank account, belonged to Hsu, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s customer, and that Hsu is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 25, 45.  Hence Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s was a scheme \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain only \xe2\x80\x9ca bank <i>customer\xe2\x80\x99s</i> property,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9ca bank\xe2\x80\x99s <i>own </i>property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The basic flaw in this argument lies in the fact that the bank, too, had property rights in Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s bank account.  When a customer deposits funds, the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds and consequently has the right to use the funds as a source of loans that help the bank earn profits (though the customer retains the right, for example, to withdraw funds).  5A Michie, Banks and Banking, ch. 9, \xc2\xa71, pp. 1\xe2\x80\x937 (2014) (Michie); <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa74b, at 54\xe2\x80\x9358; <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa738, at 162; <i>Phoenix Bank</i> v. <i>Risley</i>,\n\n111 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125,\n127 (1884)\n.  Sometimes, the contract between the customerand the bank provides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank merely assumes possession.  Michie, ch. 9, \xc2\xa738, at 162; <i>Phoenix Bank,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 127.  But even then the bank is like a bailee, say, a garage that stores a customer\xe2\x80\x99s car.  Michie, ch. 9, \xc2\xa738, at 162.  And as bailee, the bank can assert the right to possess the deposited funds against all the world but for the bailor (or, say, the bailor\xe2\x80\x99s authorized agent).  8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment \xc2\xa7166, pp. 685\xe2\x80\x93686 (2009).  This right, too, is a property right.  2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England<i> </i>452\xe2\x80\x93454 (1766) (referring to a bailee\xe2\x80\x99s right in a bailment as a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial qualified property\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s scheme to cheat Hsu was also a scheme to deprive the bank of certain bank property rights.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hence, for purposes of the bank fraud statute, a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor\xe2\x80\x99s account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d at least where, as here, the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits, the funds obtained came from the deposit account, and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Shaw says he did not intend to cause the bank financial harm.  Indeed, the parties appear to agree that, due to standard banking practices in place at the time of the fraud, no bank involved in the scheme ultimately suffered any monetary loss.  Brief for Petitioner 4; Brief for United States 4, 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But the statute, while insisting upon \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d demands neither a showing of ultimate financial loss nor a showing of intent to cause financial loss.  Many years ago Judge Learned Hand pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] man is none the less cheated out of his property, when he is induced to part with it by fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d even if \xe2\x80\x9che gets a quid pro quo of equal value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rowe</i>, 56 F. 2d 747, 749 (CA2 1932).  That is because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t may be impossible to measure his loss by the gross scales available to a court, but he has suffered a wrong; he has lost,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, \xe2\x80\x9chis chance to bargain with the facts before him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law<i> </i>132 (1881) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it to be false, but intending that the other should believe and act upon it\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9325 (1999) (bank fraud statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of fraud reflects the common law).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is consequently not surprising that, when interpreting the analogous mail fraud statute, we have held it \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d that the victim (here, the bank) be \xe2\x80\x9cdeprived of its right\xe2\x80\x9d to use of the property, even if it ultimately did not suffer unreimbursed loss.  <i>Carpenter</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19\n\xe2\x80\x9327 (1987).  Lower courts have explained that, where cash is taken from a bank \xe2\x80\x9cbut the bank [is] fully insured[,] [t]he theft [is] complete when the cash [i]s taken; the fact that the bank ha[s] a contract with an insur-ance company enabling it to shift the loss to that company [is] immaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Kucik</i>, 844 F.\xc2\xa02d 493, 495 (CA7 1988).  And commentators have made clear that \xe2\x80\x9con the criminal side, it is generally held that the lack of financial loss is no defense to false pretenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa78.7(i)(3), p. 404 (1986).  We have found no case from this Court interpreting the bank fraud statute as requiring that the victim bank ultimately suffer financial harm, or that the defendant intend that the victim bank suffer such harm.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, Shaw appears to argue that, whatever the true state of property law, he did not <i>know </i>that the bank had a property interest in Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s account; hence he could not have intended to cheat the bank of its property.  Shaw did know, however, that the bank possessed Hsu\xe2\x80\x99s account.  He did make false statements to the bank.  He did correctly believe that those false statements would lead the bankto release from that account funds that ultimately and wrongfully ended up in Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s pocket.  And the bank did in fact possess a property interest in the account.  These facts are sufficient to show that Shaw knew he was entering into a scheme to defraud the bank even if he was not aware of the niceties of bank-related property law.  To require more, <i>i.e.,</i> to require actual knowledge of those bank-related property-law niceties, would free (or convict) equally culpable defendants depending upon their property-law expertise\xe2\x80\x94an arbitrary result.  We have found nocase from this Court requiring legal knowledge of the kind Shaw suggests he lacked.  But we have found cases in roughly similar fraud-related contexts where this Court has asked only whether the targeted property was in fact property in the hands of the victim, not whether the defendant knew that the law would characterize the items at issue as \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Pasquantino</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349\n\xe2\x80\x93356 (2005) (Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to uncollected excise taxes on imported liquor counted as \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the wire fraud statute);<i> Carpenter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (a newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the confidentiality of the contents and timing of a news column counted as property for the purposes of the mail and wire fraud statutes).  We conclude that the legal ignorance that Shaw claims here is no defense to criminal prosecution for bank fraud.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, Shaw argues that the bank fraud statute requires the Government to prove more than his simple <i>knowledge </i>that he would likely harm the bank\xe2\x80\x99s property interest; in his view, the Government must prove that such was his <i>purpose.  </i>See <i>Voisine </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (\xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d committing an assault requires an awareness \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that [harm] is practically certain,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whereas \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully\xe2\x80\x9d committing an assault is \xe2\x80\x9cto have that result as a \xe2\x80\x98conscious object\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72.02(2)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) (1962))).  Shaw adds that his purpose was to take money from Hsu; taking property from the bank was not his <i>purpose.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the statute itself makes criminal the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>knowin[g] </i>execut[ion of] a scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  To hold that something other than knowledge is required would assume that Congress intended to distinguish, in respect to states of mind, between (1) the fraudulent scheme, and (2) its fraudulent elements.  Why would Congress wish to do so?  Shaw refers us to a number of cases involving fraud against the Government and points to language in those cases suggesting that the relevant statutes required that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose be to harm the statutorily protected target and not a third party.  Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9329.  But in two of those cases, the fraudulent statement was made not to the Government but to the third party\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance not present here.  See <i>Allison Engine Co.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Sanders</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662\n\xe2\x80\x93668 (2008); <i>Tanner</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107\n\xe2\x80\x93112 (1987).  In the third, the relevant portion of the statute expressly required a false statement \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for the <i>purpose</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. defrauding the Government of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cohn</i>,\n\n270 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339\n(1926) (emphasis added).  As for the fourth case, the language Shaw cites states the uncontroversial proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cdefrauding or attempting to defraud the United States\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cfraud against the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bridges</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209\n\xe2\x80\x93222 (1953).  In any event, these cases all involved crimes of fraud targeting the Government\xe2\x80\x94an area of the law with its own special rules and protections.  We have found no relevant authority in the area of mail fraud, wire fraud, financial frauds, or the like supporting Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fifth, Shaw, reading the bank fraud statute as a whole, urges us to compare subsection (1) with subsection (2).  <i>Supra,</i> at 1.  Subsection (2), he points out, makes criminal the use of \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent pretenses\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain \xe2\x80\x9cproperty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under the custody or control of\xe2\x80\x9d a bank.  And in his view that fact means that we should read subsection (1) not to apply to those circumstances.  That is to say, given the language of subsection (2), efforts such as his effort fraudulently to obtain money deposited in a bank account should not fall within the scope of the subsection (1) phrase \xe2\x80\x9cscheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defraud a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 30\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As we read the two subsections, however, they do not demand that interpretation.  The two subsections overlap substantially but not completely.  Subsection (2) makes criminal the use of a scheme</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cto obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This language covers much that subsection (1) also covers, for example, making a false representation to a bank in order to obtain property belonging to that bank.  See <i>Loughrin </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, n. 4 (2014) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n. 4) (recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d overlap between the two subsections and noting that such overlap \xe2\x80\x9cis not uncommon in criminal statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the same time, it applies to a circumstance in which a shopper makes a false statement to a department store cashier in order to pay for goods with money \xe2\x80\x9cunder the custody or control of a financial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d say, Bank A.  The shopper\xe2\x80\x99s false statement, though designed to obtain Bank A\xe2\x80\x99s property, might well not amount to an effort (under subsection (1)) to defraud Bank A (since the statement was made not to Bank A but to an agent of the department store).  Given, on the one hand, the overlap and, on the other hand, a plausible reading of the language that applies it to circumstances significantly different from those at issue here, we have no good reason to read subsection (2) as excluding from subsection (1) applications that would otherwise fall within the scope of subsection (1), such as conduct of the kind before us.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Shaw asks us to apply the rule of lenity.  Brief for Petitioner 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  We have said that the rule applies if \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Callanan</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587,\n596 (1961)\n, there is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Muscarello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125\n\xe2\x80\x93139 (1998) (quoting <i>Staples</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600,\n619, n.\n17 (1994)\n).  The statute is clear enough that we need not rely on the rule of lenity.  As we have said, a deposit account at a bank counts as bank property for purposes of subsection (1).  <i>Supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The defendant, in circumstances such as those present here, need not know that the deposit account is, as a legal matter, characterized as bank property.  <i>Supra</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Moreover, in those circumstances, the Government need not prove that the defendant intended that the bank ultimately suffer monetary loss.  <i>Supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Finally, the statute as applied here requires a state of mind equivalent to knowledge, not purpose.  <i>Supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Shaw further argues that the instructions the District Court gave the jury were erroneous.  He points out that the District Court told the jury that the</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cphrase \xe2\x80\x98scheme to defraud\xe2\x80\x99 means any deliberate plan of action or course of conduct by which someoneintends to deceive, cheat, <i>or</i> deprive a financial institution of something of value.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 18 (emphasisadded).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This instruction, Shaw says, could be understood as permitting the jury to find him guilty if it found no more than that his scheme was one to deceive the bank but notto<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9c<i>deprive</i>\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>the bank of anything of value.  Brief for Petitioner 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  The parties agree, as do we, that the scheme must be one to deceive the bank <i>and </i>deprive it of something of value.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For reasons previously pointed out, we have held that a plan to deprive a bank of money in a customer\xe2\x80\x99s deposit account is a plan to deprive the bank of \xe2\x80\x9csomething of value\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the bank fraud statute.  The parties dispute whether the jury instruction is nonetheless ambiguous or otherwise improper.  We leave to the Ninth Circuit to determine whether that question was fairly presented to that court and, if so, whether the instruction is lawful, and, if not, whether any error was harmless in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
