BTR, Inc. (BTR), owns the patent rights to sorbothane, and its wholly owned subsidiaries manufacture the product in the United States and Britain. Hamilton-Kent Manufacturing Company (Hamilton-Kent) and Sorbothane, Inc. (S. 1.), were at all relevant times owned by BTR. S. 1. was formed in 1982 to take over Hamilton-Kent\'s sorbothane business.1 App. to Pet. for Cert. A3. Respondents Shirley and Larry McQuillan, doing business as Sorboturf Enterprises, were regional distributors of sorbothane products from 1981 to 1983. Petitioner Spectrum Sports, Inc. (Spectrum), was also a distributor of sorbothane products. Petitioner Kenneth B.

The letter of intent granted the McQuillans exclusive rights to purchase sorbothane forusein equestrian products. Respondents were designing a horseshoe pad using sorbothane.</p><p>In 1981, Hamilton-Kent decided to establish five regional distributorships for sorbothane.

In April 1982, Hamilton-Kent told respondents that it wanted them to relinquish their athletic shoe distributorship as a condition for retaining the right to develop and distribute equestrian products. As of May 1982, BTR had moved the sorbothane business from Hamilton-Kent to S. 1. <i>Id., </i>at A6. In May, the marketing manager of S. 1. again made clear that respondents had to sell their athletic distributorship to keep their equestrian distribution rights.

Petitioners were also found to have violated civil RICO and the California unfair practices law, but not \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act. The jury awarded $1,743,000 in compensatory damages on each of the violations found to have occurred.3 This amount was trebled under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.

The court expressly ruled that the trial court had properly instructed the jury on the Sherman Act claims and found that the evidence supported the liability verdicts as well as the damages awards on these claims. The court then affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding it unnecessary to rule on challenges to other violations found by the jury. App. to Pet. for Cert. A28. On the \xc2\xa7 2 issue that petitioners present here, the Court of Appeals, noting that the jury had found that petitioners had violated \xc2\xa7 2 without specifying whether they had monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or conspired to monopolize, held that the verdict would stand if the evidence supported anyone of the three possible violations of \xc2\xa7 2. <i>Id., </i>at A15. The court went on to conclude that a case of attempted monopolization had been established.4 The court rejected petitioners\' argument that attempted monopolization had not been established because respondents had failed to prove that petitioners had a specific intent to monopolize a relevant market.

In <i>Walker Process Equipment, Inc. </i>v. <i>Food Machinery </i>&amp; <i>Chemical Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/172/case.html">382 U. S. 172</a>, 177 (1965), we found that enforcement of a fraudulently obtained patent claim could violate the Sherman Act.

S. 347</a> (1912). In dissenting in that case on other grounds, the Justice, citing <i>Swift, </i>stated that an attempt may be found where the danger of harm is very great; however, "combination, intention and overt act may all be present without amounting to a criminal attempt .... There must be dangerous proximity to success." 225 U.

S. 752</a> (1984), that "Congress authorized Sherman Act scrutiny of single firms only when they pose a danger of monopolization. Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk that the antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive entrepreneur." <i>Id., </i>at 768. Thus, the conduct of a single firm, governed by \xc2\xa7 2, "is unlawful only when it threatens actual monopolization." <i>Id., </i>at 767.

S. 781</a>, 785 (1946).</p><p>The Courts of Appeals other than the Ninth Circuit have followed this approach. Consistent with our cases, it is generally required that to demonstrate attempted monopolization a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. See 3 Areeda &amp; Turner, <i>supra, , </i>820, at 312. In order to determine whether there is a dangerous probability of monopolization, courts have found it necessary to consider the relevant market and the defendant\'s ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market.8</p><p>8 See, e. g., Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co., 917 F. 2d, at 1431-1432; Twin Laboratories, Inc. v. Weider Health &amp; Fitness, 900 F. 2d, at 570; Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v.

Respondents urge us to affirm the decision below. We are not at all inclined, however, to embrace <i>Lessig\'s </i>interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2, for there is little, if any, support for it in the statute or the case law, and the notion that proof of unfair or predatory conduct alone is sufficient to make out the offense of attempted monopolization is contrary to the purpose and policy of the Sherman Act.</p><p>The <i>Lessig </i>opinion claimed support from the language of \xc2\xa7 2, which prohibits attempts to monopolize "any part" of commerce, and therefore forbids attempts to monopolize any appreciable segment of interstate sales of the relevant product. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Yellow Cab Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/218/case.html">332 U. S. 218</a>, 226 (1947). The "any part" clause, however, applies to charges of monopolization as well as to attempts to monopolize, and it is beyond doubt that the former requires proof of market power in a relevant market. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Grinnell Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/563/case.html">384 U. S. 563</a>, 570-571 (1966); <i>United States </i>v. <i>E. </i>1. <i>du Pont de Nemours </i>&amp; <i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/377/case.html">351 U. S. 377</a>, 404 (1956).9</p><p>In support of its determination that an inference of dangerous probability was permissible from a showing of intent, the <i>Lessig </i>opinion cited, and added emphasis to, this Court\'s reference in its opinion in <i>Swift </i>to "\'intent and the <i>consequent </i>dangerous probability.\'\'\' 327 F. 2d, at 474, n. 46, quoting 196 U.

It is a question of proximity and degree." <i>Id., </i>at 402.</p><p>The <i>Lessig </i>court also relied on a footnote in <i>Du Pont </i>&amp; <i>Co., supra, </i>at 395, n. 23, for the proposition that when the charge is attempt to monopolize, the relevant market is "not in issue." That footnote, which appeared in analysis of the relevant market issue in <i>Du Pont, </i>rejected the Government\'s reliance on several cases, noting that "the scope of the market was not in issue" in <i>Story Parchment Co. </i>v. <i>Paterson Parchment Paper Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/282/555/case.html">282 U. S. 555</a> (1931). That reference merely reflected the fact that, in <i>Story Parchment, </i>which was not an attempt to monopolize case, the parties did not challenge the definition of the market adopted by the lower courts. Nor was <i>Du Pont </i>itself concerned with the issue in this case.</p><p>It is also our view that <i>Lessig </i>and later Ninth Circuit decisions refining and applying it are inconsistent with the policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. See, <i>e. g., Brunswick Corp. </i>v. <i>Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html">429 U. S. 477</a>, 488 (1977); <i>Cargill, Inc. </i>v. <i>Monfort of Colorado, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/104/case.html">479 U. S. 104</a>, 116-117 (1986); <i>Brown Shoe Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/294/case.html">370 U. S. 294</a>, 320 (1962). Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of \xc2\xa7 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is some-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="459">459</a></p><p>times difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by \xc2\xa7 1, which "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." <i>Copper</i>weld, 467 U. S., at 767-769. For these reasons, \xc2\xa7 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. <i>Id., </i>at 767. The concern that \xc2\xa7 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquiring only whether the defendant has engaged in "unfair" or "predatory" tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which is something more than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the relevant product and geographic market and the defendant\'s economic power in that market.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>We hold that petitioners may not be liable for attempted monopolization under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act absent proof of a dangerous probability that they would monopolize a particular market and specific intent to monopolize. In this case, the trial instructions allowed the jury to infer specific intent and dangerous probability of success from the defendants\' predatory conduct, without any proof of the relevant market or of a realistic probability that the defendants could achieve monopoly power in that market. In this respect, the instructions misconstrued \xc2\xa7 2, as did the Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment of the District Court. Since the affirmance of the \xc2\xa7 2 judgment against petitioners rested solely on the legally erroneous conclusion that petitioners had attempted to monopolize in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 and since the jury\'s verdict did not negate the possibility that the \xc2\xa7 2 verdict rested on the attempt to monopolize ground alone, the judg-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="460">460</a></p><p>ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, <i>Sunkist Growers, Inc. </i>v. <i>Winckler </i>&amp; <i>Smith Citrus Products Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/19/case.html">370 U.
