The Tribe also objects to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d prong as requiring the showing of an \xe2\x80\x9cexternal obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d to timely filing.

Three lawsuits making such claims are relevant here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first was a class action filed by the Ramah Navajo Chapter alleging that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) systematically underpaid certain contract support costs.  <i>Ramah Navajo Chapter </i>v. <i>Lujan</i>, No. 1:90\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x930957 (D\xc2\xa0NM) (filed Oct. 4, 1990).  In 1993, Ramah successfully moved for certification of a nationwide class of all tribes that had contracted with the BIA under the ISDA.  See Order and Memorandum Opinion in <i>Ramah Navajo Chapter </i>v. <i>Lujan</i>, No. 1:90\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x930957 (D\xc2\xa0NM, Oct. 1, 1993), App. 35\xe2\x80\x9340.  The Government argued that each tribe needed to present its claims to a contracting officer before it could participate in the class.  <i>Id.,</i> at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  But the trial court held that tribal contractors could participate in the class without presentment, because the suit alleged systemwide flaws in the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s contracting scheme, not merely breaches of individual contracts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 39.  The Government did not appeal the certification order, and the <i>Ramah </i>class action proceeded to further litigation and settlement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second relevant ISDA suit raised similar claims about contract support costs but arose from contracts with the Indian Health Service (IHS).  <i>Cherokee Nation of Okla. </i>v. <i>United States</i>, No. 6:99\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x930092 (ED\xc2\xa0Okla.) (filed Mar. 5, 1999).  In <i>Cherokee Nation</i>,<i> </i>two tribes filed a putative class action against IHS.  On February 9, 2001, the District Court denied class certification without addressing whether tribes would need to present claims to join the class.  <i>Cherokee Nation of Okla. </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 199 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 357, 363\xe2\x80\x93366 (ED\xc2\xa0Okla.).  The two plaintiff tribes did not appeal the denial of class certification but proceeded to the merits on their own, eventually prevailing before this Court in a parallel suit.  See <i>Cherokee Nation of Okla.</i> v. <i>Leavitt</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631 (2005)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The third relevant case is the one now before us.  In this case, the Tribe presented its contract support claims (for contract years 1995 through 2004) to IHS on September 7, 2005, shortly after our <i>Cherokee Nation </i>ruling.  As relevant here, the contracting officer denied the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s claims based on its 1996, 1997, and 1998 contracts because, <i>inter alia,</i> those claims were barred by the CDA\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year statute of limitations.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The Tribe challenged the denials in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing, based on theories of class-action and equitable tolling, that the limitations period should be tolled for the 707 days that the putative <i>Cherokee Nation </i>class had been pending.  See <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538 (1974)\n (class-action tolling); <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631 (2010)\n (equitable tolling).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Initially, the District Court held that the limitations period was jurisdictional and thus forbade tolling of any sort.  539 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 152, 154, and n.\xc2\xa02 (DDC 2008).  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the limitations period was not jurisdictional and thus did not necessarily bar tolling.  614 F.\xc2\xa03d 519, 526 (2010).  But the court held that the Tribe was ineligible for class-action tolling during the pendency of the putative <i>Cherokee Nation </i>class, because the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present its claims to IHS made it \xe2\x80\x9cineligible to participate in the class action at the time class certification [was] denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  614 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 527 (applying <i>American Pipe</i>).  The court then remanded the case to the District Court to determine the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On remand, the District Court concluded that the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s asserted reasons for failing to present its claims within the specified time \xe2\x80\x9cdo not, individually or collec-tively, amount to an extraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d that could warrant equitable tolling.  841 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 99, 107 (DC 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This time, the Court of Appeals affirmed.  764 F.\xc2\xa03d 51 (CADC 2014).  It explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o count as sufficiently \xe2\x80\x98extraordinary\xe2\x80\x99 to support equitable tolling, the circumstances that caused a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s delay must have been beyond its control,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be a product of that litigant\xe2\x80\x99s own misunderstanding of the law or tactical mistakes in litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 58.  Because none of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s proffered circumstances was beyond its control, the court held, there were no extraordinary circumstances that could merit equitable tolling.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision created a split with the Federal Circuit, which granted another tribal entity equitable tolling under similar circumstances.  See <i>Arctic Slope Native Assn., Ltd.</i> v. <i>Sebelius</i>, 699 F.\xc2\xa03d 1289 (CA Fed. 2012).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals denied the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s request for equitable tolling by applying the test that we articulated in <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631\n.  Under <i>Holland</i>,<i> </i>a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 649 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tribe calls this formulation of the equitable tolling test overly rigid, given the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s equitable nature.  First, it argues that diligence and extraordinary circumstances should be considered together as two factors in a unitary test, and it faults the Court of Appeals for declining to consider the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s diligence in connection with its finding that no extraordinary circumstances existed.  But we have expressly characterized equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x99s two components as \xe2\x80\x9celements,\xe2\x80\x9d not merely factors of indeterminate or commensurable weight.  <i>Pace</i> v. <i>DiGuglielmo</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408,\n418 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we have treated the two requirements as distinct elements in practice, too, rejecting requests for equitable tolling where a litigant failed to satisfy one without addressing whether he satisfied the other.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327\n\xe2\x80\x93337 (2007) (rejecting equitable tolling without addressing diligence because habeas petitioner fell \xe2\x80\x9cfar short of showing \xe2\x80\x98extraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Pace</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 418 (holding, without resolving litigant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he had \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied the extraordinary circumstance test,\xe2\x80\x9d that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if we were to accept [his argument], he would not be entitled to relief because he has not established the requisite diligence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Tribe objects to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d prong as requiring a litigant seeking tolling to show an \xe2\x80\x9cexternal obstacl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d to timely filing, <i>i.e.</i>, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances that caused a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s delay must have been beyond its control.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  The Tribe complains that this \xe2\x80\x9cexternal obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d formulation amounts to the same kind of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overly rigid <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i> approach\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we rejected in <i>Holland</i>.  Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 653).  But in truth, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexternal obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d merely reflects our requirement that a litigant seeking tolling show \xe2\x80\x9cthat some extraordinary circumstance <i>stood in his way</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 649 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  This phrasing in <i>Holland </i>(and in <i>Pace</i> before that) would make little sense if equitable tolling were available when a litigant was responsible for its <i>own</i> delay.  Indeed, the diligence prong already covers those affairs within the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s control; the extraordinary-circumstances prong, by contrast, is meant to cover matters outside its control.  We therefore reaffirm that the second prong of the equitable tolling test is met only where the circumstances that caused a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s delay are both extraordinary <i>and </i>beyond its control.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Tribe offers no circumstances that meet this standard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Its mistaken reliance on the putative <i>Cherokee Nation </i>class action was not an obstacle beyond its control.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  As the Tribe conceded below, see 614 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 526\xe2\x80\x93527, it could not have been a member of the putative <i>Cherokee Nation</i> class because it did not present its claims to an IHS contracting officer before class certification was denied.  Before then, the Tribe had unilateral authority to present its claims and to join the putative class.  Presentment was blocked not by an obstacle outside its control, but by the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken belief that presentment was unneeded.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s mistake, in essence, was its inference that the reasoning of the <i>Ramah </i>class certification decision (allowing tribes to participate\xe2\x80\x94without presentment\xe2\x80\x94in the class challenging underpayment of BIA contract support costs) applied to the putative <i>Cherokee Nation </i>class.  This mistake was fundamentally no different from \xe2\x80\x9ca garden variety claim of excusable neglect,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89,\n96 (1990)\n, \xe2\x80\x9csuch as a simple \xe2\x80\x98miscalculation\xe2\x80\x99 that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Holland</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 651<i> </i>(quoting <i>Lawrence</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 336).  And it is quite different from relying on <i>actually binding </i>precedent that is subsequently reversed.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s other excuses are even less compelling.  Its belief that presentment was futile was not an obstacle beyond its control but a species of the same mistake that kept it out of the putative <i>Cherokee Nation </i>class.  And the fact that there may have been significant risk and expense associated with presenting and litigating its claims is far from extraordinary.  As the District Court noted below, \xe2\x80\x9cit is common for a litigant to be confronted with significant costs to litigation, limited financial resources, an uncertain outcome based upon an uncertain legal landscape, and impending deadlines.  These circumstances are not \xe2\x80\x98extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  841 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 107.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Tribe also urges us to consider the special relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, as articulated in the ISDA.  See\n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7450a(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do not question the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d but any specific obligations the Government may have under that relationship are \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned by statute rather than the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jicarilla Apache Nation</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 162,\n165 (2011)\n.  The ISDA and CDA establish a clear procedure for the resolution of disputes over ISDA contracts, with an unambiguous 6-year deadline for presentment of claims.
