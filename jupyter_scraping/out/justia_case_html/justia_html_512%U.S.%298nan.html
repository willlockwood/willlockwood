The Court\'s decision in <i>Container Corp. </i>did not address the constitutionality of California\'s taxing scheme as applied to "domestic corporations with foreign parents or [to] foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries." <i>Id., </i>at 189, n. 26. In the consolidated cases before us, we return to the taxing scheme earlier considered in <i>Container Corp. </i>and resolve matters left open in that case.</p><p>The petitioner in No. 92-1384, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), is a United Kingdom corporation in the Barclays Group, a multinational banking enterprise. The petitioner in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate), is the United States-based parent of a multinational manufacturing and sales enterprise. Each enterprise has operations in California. During the years here at issue, California determined the state corporate franchise tax due for these operations under a method known as "worldwide combined reporting." California\'s scheme first looked to the worldwide income of the multinational enterprise, and then attributed a portion of that income (equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located in California) to the California operations. The State imposed its tax on the income thus attributed to Barclays\' and Colgate\'s California business.</p><p>Barclays urges that California\'s tax system distinctively burdens foreign-based multinationals and results in double international taxation, in violation of the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. Both Barclays and Colgate contend that the scheme offends the Commerce Clause by frustrating the Federal Government\'s ability to "speak with one voice when</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="303">303</a></p><p>regulating commercial relations with foreign governments." <i>Japan Line, Ltd. </i>v. <i>County of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/case.html">441 U. S. 434</a>, 449 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). We reject these arguments, and hold that the Constitution does not impede application of California\'s corporate franchise tax to Barclays and Colgate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the California Court of Appeal.</p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p>The Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution, this Court has held, prevent States that impose an income-based tax on nonresidents from "tax [ing] value earned outside [the taxing State\'s] borders." <i>ASARCO Inc. </i>v. <i>Idaho Tax Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/307/case.html">458 U. S. 307</a>, 315 (1982). But when a business enterprise operates in more than one taxing jurisdiction, arriving at "precise territorial allocations of \'value\' is often an elusive goal, both in theory and in practice." <i>Container Corp., </i>463 U. S., at 164. Every method of allocation devised involves some degree of arbitrariness. See id., at 182.</p><p>One means of deriving locally taxable income, generally used by States that collect corporate income-based taxes, is the "unitary business" method. As explained in <i>Container Corp., </i>unitary taxation "rejects geographical or transactional accounting," which is "subject to manipulation" and does not fully capture "the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the components of a single enterprise." <i>Id., </i>at 164-165. The "unitary business/formula apportionment" method</p><blockquote><p>\n"calculates the local tax base by first defining the scope of the \'unitary business\' of which the taxed enterprise\'s activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and then apportioning the total income of that \'unitary business\' between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the world on the basis of a formula taking into account ob-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="304">304</a></p><p>304 BARCLAYS BANK PLC <i>v. </i>FRANCHISE TAX BD.

California\'s scheme required the taxpayer to aggregate the income of all corporate entities composing the unitary business enterprise, including in the aggregation both affiliates operating abroad and those operating within the United States. Having defined the scope of the "unitary business" thus broadly, California used a long-accepted method of apportionment, commonly called the "three-factor" formula, to arrive at the amount of income attributable to the operations of the enterprise in California. Under the three-factor formula, California taxed a percentage of worldwide income equal to the arithmetic average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located inside the State. Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 25128</p><p>1 This Court first considered the "unitary business principle" in 1897, <i>Adams Express Co. </i>v. <i>Ohio State Auditor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/165/194/case.html">165 U.

On the determination whether a business is "unitary," see <i>Allied-Signal, </i>504 U.

Thus, if a unitary business had 8% of its payroll, 3% of its property, and 4% of its sales in California, the State took the average-5%-and imposed its tax on that percentage of the business\' total income.2</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The corporate income tax imposed by the United States employs a "separate accounting" method, a means of apportioning income among taxing sovereigns used by all major developed nations. In contrast to combined reporting, separate accounting treats each corporate entity discretely for the purpose of determining income tax liability.3</p><p>Separate accounting poses the risk that a conglomerate will manipulate transfers of value among its components to minimize its total tax liability. To guard against such manipulation, transactions between affiliated corporations must be scrutinized to ensure that they are reported on an "arm\'slength" basis, i. <i>e., </i>at a price reflecting their true market value.

S., at 185.5</p><p>At one time, a number of States used worldwide combined reporting, as California did during the years at issue. In recent years, such States, including California, have modified their systems at least to allow corporate election of some variant of an approach that confines combined reporting to the United States\' "water\'s edge." See 1 Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein, <i>supra </i>n. 1, , 8.16, at 8-185 to 8-187. California\'s 1986 modification of its corporate franchise tax, effective in 1988, 1986 Cal.

The 1986 amendment conditioned a corporate group\'s water\'s edge election on payment of a substantial fee, and allowed the California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) to disregard a water\'s edge election under certain circumstances.

Based in the United Kingdom, the Barclays Group includes more than 220 corporations doing business in some 60 nations. The two refundseeking members of the Barclays corporate family did business in California and were therefore subject to California\'s franchise tax. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal), one of the two taxpayers, was a California banking corporation wholly owned by Barclays Bank International Limited (BB!), the second taxpayer. BBI, a United Kingdom corporation, did business in the United Kingdom and in more than 33 other nations and territories.</p><p>In computing its California franchise tax based on 1977 income, Barcal reported only the income from its own operations. BBI reported income on the assumption that it participated in a unitary business composed of itself and its subsidiaries, but not its parent corporation and the parent\'s other subsidiaries. After auditing BBl\'s and Barcal\'s 1977 income year franchise tax returns, the Tax Board, respondent here, determined that both were part of a worldwide unitary business, the Barclays Group. Ultimately, the Tax Board assessed additional tax liability of $1,678 for BBI and $152,420 for Barcal. 6</p><p>6 The figures used by the Tax Board were:</p>\n<table cellpadding="4">\n<tbody><tr><td><br/><br/>Taxpayer</td><td>Worldwide<br/>Taxable<br/>Income<br/></td><td>California<br/>Formula<br/>Percentage</td><td>Business<br/>Income<br/></td><td><br/>Franchise<br/>Tax</td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Barcal</td><td>$401,566,973</td><td>.0139032%</td><td>$5,583,066</td><td>$693,696</td></tr>\n<tr><td>BBI</td><td>\xc2\xa0401,566,973</td><td>.0003232%</td><td>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0129,786</td><td>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa016,126</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>App. in No. 92-1384, pp. A-13 to A-14 (Joint Stipulation of Facts\' 22).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="308">308</a></p><p>308 BARCLAYS BANK PLC <i>v. </i>FRANCHISE TAX BD.

Barclays rests its argument on the observation that "foreign multinationals typically have more of their operations and entities outside of the United States [compared to] domestic multinationals, which typically have a smaller share of their operations and entities outside of the United States." Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, at 33.16 As a result, a higher proportion of the income of a foreign multinational is subject to taxation by foreign sovereigns.

See <i>Container Corp., 463 </i>U. S., at 187; cf. id., at 199-200 (Powell, J., dissenting) (describing how formulary apportionment leads to multiple taxation). Nor do we question that foreign-based multinationals have a higher proportion of such income, on average, than do their United States counterparts. But <i>Container Corp.\'s </i>approval of this very tax, in the face of a multiple taxation challenge, did not rest on any insufficiency in the evidence that multiple taxation might occur; indeed, we accepted in that case the taxpayer\'s assertion that multiple taxation in fact had occurred. <i>Id., </i>at 187 ("[T]he tax imposed here, like the tax in <i>Japan Line, </i>has resulted in actual double taxation, in the sense that some of the income taxed without apportionment by foreign nations as attributable to appellant\'s foreign subsidiaries was also taxed by California as attributable to the State\'s share of the total income of the unitary business of which those subsidiaries are a part."); see also id., at 187, n. 22.</p><p><i>Container Corp.\'s </i>holding on multiple taxation relied on two considerations: first, that multiple taxation was not the "inevitable result" of the California tax; 17 and, second, that the "alternativ[e] reasonably available to the taxing State" (i. <i>e., </i>some version of the separate accounting/"arm\'s length"</p><p>17The Court stated: "[T]he double taxation in this case, although real, is not the \'inevitabl[e]\' result of the California taxing scheme ....

Ibid. </i>(emphasis added); see also <i>id., </i>at 192 ("California would have trouble avoiding multiple taxation even if it adopted the \'arm\'s-length\' approach .... ").</p><p>These considerations are not dispositively diminished when California\'s tax is applied to the components of foreign, as opposed to domestic, multinationals. Multiple taxation of such entities because of California\'s scheme is not "inevitable"; the existence <i>vel non </i>of actual multiple taxation of income remains, as in <i>Container Corp., </i>dependent "on the facts of the individual case." <i>Id., </i>at 188. And if, as we have held, adoption of a separate accounting system does not dispositively lessen the risk of multiple taxation of the income earned by foreign affiliates of <i>domestic-owned </i>corporations, we see no reason why it would do so in respect of the income earned by foreign affiliates of <i>foreign-owned </i>corporations.

Air carriers were taxed on all aviation fuel purchased in Florida, without regard to the amount the carrier consumed within the State or the amount of its in-state business. The carrier in <i>Wardair, </i>a Canadian airline that operated charter flights to and from the United States, conceded that the challenged tax satisfied the <i>Complete Auto </i>criteria and entailed no threat of multiple international taxation. Joined by the United States as <i>amicus curiae, </i>however, the carrier urged that Florida\'s tax "threaten[ed] the ability of the Federal Government to \'speak with one voice.\'" 477 U. S., at 9. There is "a federal policy," the carrier asserted, "of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, and supplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic"; this policy, the carrier argued, "represents the statement that the \'one voice\' of the Federal Government wishes to make," a statement "threatened by [Florida\'s tax]." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>This Court disagreed, observing that the proffered evidence disclosed no federal policy of the kind described and indeed demonstrated that the Federal Government intended to <i>permit </i>the States to impose sales taxes on aviation fuel.

Most of the bilateral agreements prohibited the Federal Government from imposing national taxes on aviation fuel used by foreign carriers, but none prohibited the States or their subdivisions from taxing the sale of fuel to foreign airlines.

That the Executive Branch proposed legislation to outlaw a state taxation practice, but encountered an unreceptive Congress, is not evidence that the practice interfered with the Nation\'s ability to speak with one voice, but is rather evidence that the preeminent speaker decided to yield the floor to others.

He asserts that federal officials had not articulated a policy opposing use by the States of worldwide combined reporting prior to the mid-1980\'s, and urges the Court to affirm the judgments below on the ground that California\'s use of worldwide combined reporting was not unconstitutional during the years here at issue, even if it became unconstitutional in later years (a question on which he takes no position, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-41). Colgate, on the other hand, suggests that the relevant time frame is "when the tax is definitively enforced by the state taxing authority, through judicial proceedings if necessary, not when the tax technically accrues under state law," Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 7, and argues in the alternative that a federal policy opposing combined worldwide reporting had been established as of <i>1970-1973, id., </i>at 9.

It is, moreover, an unquestionable improvement over <i>Itel: </i>whereas the "speak with one voice" analysis of that opinion gave the power to determine the constitutionality of a state law to the Executive Branch, see 507 U.

But because the State and private parties have justifiably relied on the constitutionality of taxing such corporations, and Congress has not seen fit to override our decision, I agree with the Court that <i>Container Corp. </i>should not be overruled, cf. <i>Quill Corp. </i>v. <i>North Dakota, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/298/case.html">504 U.

I therefore concur in the judgment in No. 921839. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, is a <i>foreign-based </i>parent company of a multinational corporate group, and our holding in <i>Container Corp. </i>expressly does not extend to this situation. See 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26, and 195, n. 32. In my view, the California tax cannot constitutionally be applied to foreign corporations. I therefore respectfully dissent in No. 92-1384.</p><p>A state tax on interstate commerce must meet four requirements under our negative Commerce Clause precedents: the tax must be on an activity with a substantial nexus to the taxing State, it must be fairly apportioned, it must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it must be fairly related to the services provided by the State. <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </i>v. <i>Brady, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html">430 U. S. 274</a>, 279 (1977). Substantially for the reasons explained by the Court, see <i>ante, </i>at 311-314, I agree that imposition of the California tax complies with the four <i>Complete Auto </i>factors. (I also agree that California\'s practice of accepting "reasonable approximations" of the statutorily required financial data does not violate due process. See <i>ante, </i>at 314-316.) A state tax on <i>foreign </i>commerce, however, must satisfy two additional inquiries: "first, whether the tax, notwithstanding apportionment, creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax prevents the Federal Government from \'speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.\' If a state tax contravenes <i>either </i>of these precepts, it is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause." <i>Japan Line, Ltd. </i>v. <i>County of Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/case.html">441 U. S. 434</a>, 451 (1979) (emphasis added).</p><p>I am in general agreement with the Court, see <i>ante, </i>at 320-329, that the second <i>Japan Line </i>factor-the purported need for federal uniformity-does not prevent the use of worldwide combined reporting in taxing foreign corpora-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="334">334</a></p><p>334 BARCLAYS BANK PLC <i>v. </i>FRANCHISE TAX BD.

I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3. The Legislature has neither approved nor disapproved the California tax. Although in such circumstances courts have the power to scrutinize taxes for consistency with our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, this determination should be made on the basis of the objective factors outlined in <i>Complete Auto </i>(and, in the foreign commerce context, the multiple taxation analysis discussed in <i>Japan Line), </i>not statements made and briefs filed by officials in the Executive Branch. Cf. <i>Itel Containers Int\'l Corp. </i>v. <i>Huddleston, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/60/case.html">507 U. S. 60</a>, 80-81 (1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Indeed, the inconsistent positions taken by the Solicitor General in the course of Barclays\' challenge to the California tax illustrate the perils of resting constitutional determinations on such "evidence." Compare Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>21-24 (arguing that the California tax was constitutionally applied to Barclays during the tax years in question), with Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>in <i>Barclays Bank </i>v. <i>Franchise Tax Board, </i>O. T. 1992, No. 92212, pp. 9-16 (arguing that the imposition of the California tax on Barclays was unconstitutional).</p><p>But I cannot agree with the Court\'s resolution of the other <i>Japan Line </i>factor-the need to avoid international multiple taxation. See <i>ante, </i>at 316-320. Barclays does 98% of its business in countries other than the United States. California, through application of worldwide combined reporting, taxes some of that income. The trial court found as a fact that "[t]here is a definite risk of, as well as actual double taxation here." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384, p. A-25. This double taxation occurs because California has adopted a taxing system that is inconsistent with the taxing method used by foreign taxing authorities. California\'s formula assigns a higher proportion of income to jurisdictions where wage rates, property values, and sales prices are</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="335">335</a></p><p>higher; to the extent that California is such a jurisdiction (and it usually will be) the formula inherently leads to double taxation. And whenever the three factors are higher in California, the State will tax income under its formula that already has been taxed by another country under accepted international practice.</p><p>In <i>Container Corp., </i>we recognized that the California tax "ha[d] resulted in actual double taxation ... stem[ming] from a serious divergence in the taxing schemes adopted by California and the foreign taxing authorities," and that "the taxing method adopted by those foreign taxing authorities is consistent with accepted international practice." 463 U. S., at 187. We nevertheless held that the tax did not violate the <i>Japan Line </i>principle. Two of the factors on which we relied-that the tax was on income rather than property, and that the multiple taxation was not "inevitable"-carry no more force today than they did 11 Terms ago, see 463 U. S., at 198-201 (Powell, J., dissenting), but they are present here as well.</p><p>We also relied on a third ground to distinguish the tax upheld in <i>Container Corp. </i>from the tax invalidated in <i>Japan Line: </i>"[T]he tax here falls, not on the foreign owners of an instrumentality of foreign commerce, but on a corporation domiciled and headquartered in the United States. We specifically left open in <i>Japan Line </i>the application of that case to \'domestically owned instrumentalities engaged in foreign commerce,\' and ... this case falls clearly within that reservation." 463 U. S., at 188-189, quoting <i>Japan Line, supra, </i>at 444, n. 7 (citation omitted). In a footnote, we continued: "We have no need to address in this opinion the constitutionality of [the California tax] with respect to state taxation of domestic corporations with foreign parents or foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries." 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26; see also id., at 195, and n. 32. As the Court recognizes, <i>ante, </i>at 317, and n. 15, Barclays\' challenge to the California tax therefore presents the question we ex-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="336">336</a></p><p>336 BARCLAYS BANK PLC <i>v. </i>FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.</p><p align="center">\nOpinion of O\'CONNOR, J.</p><p>pressly left open in <i>Container Corp.: </i>does it make a constitutional difference that the multiple taxation resulting from California\'s use of worldwide combined reporting falls on a foreign corporation rather than a domestic one? In my view, the answer is yes.</p><p><i>Japan Line </i>teaches that where the instrumentality of commerce-and analogously, the corporate domicile-is foreign, the multiple taxation resulting from a state taxing scheme may violate the Commerce Clause even though the same tax would be constitutional as applied to a domestic corporation. 441 U. S., at 447-448. When worldwide combined reporting is applied to American corporate groups with foreign affiliates, as in <i>Container Corp., </i>income attributable to those foreign companies will be taxed by California, even though they are also subject to tax in foreign countries. But in such cases the incidence of the tax falls on the domestic parent corporation-a corporation subject to full taxation in the United States notwithstanding the source of its income. When the California tax is applied to a foreign corporate group with both domestic and foreign affiliates, some of the income of the foreign companies will also be taxed by California. The incidence of the tax in such cases falls on a <i>foreign </i>corporation, even though the United States (and its subnational governments) is entitled to tax only the income earned domestically.</p><p>In my view, the States are prohibited (absent express congressional authorization) by the Foreign Commerce Clause from adopting a system of taxation that, because it does not conform to international practice, results in multiple taxation of foreign corporations. It may be that such a rule "leave[s] California free to discriminate against a Delaware corporation in favor of an overseas corporation," <i>Container Corp., </i>463 U. S., at 203 (Powell, J., dissenting), but the reason for this differential treatment is obvious. Domestic taxpayers have access to the political process, at both the state and national levels, that foreign taxpayers simply do not enjoy.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="337">337</a></p><p>If California\'s tax results in intolerable double taxation of domestic corporations, those companies can seek redress through the normal channels. Cf. <i>Minnesota </i>v. <i>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/456/case.html">449 U. S. 456</a>, 473, n. 17 (1981); <i>Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. </i>v. <i>Rice, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/429/case.html">434 U. S. 429</a>, 444, n. 18 (1978). It is all too easy, however, for the state legislature to fill the State\'s coffers at the expense of outsiders.</p><p>Most of the United States\' trading partners have objected to California\'s use of worldwide combined reporting. See Demarche from Danish Embassy, on behalf of Governments of European Community (Mar. 26, 1993) ("The views of the EC Member States on worldwide unitary taxation are well known to the United States Government. All Member States have expressed their strong opposition to [the California] tax in a number of diplomatic communiques to the United States Government from 1980 to the present date"); Demarche from Belgian Embassy, on behalf of Governments of Member States of European Community and of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland (Sept. 23, 1993). At least one country has already enacted retaliatory legislation. See Brief for Government of United Kingdom as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>19-23. Moreover, the possibility of multiple taxation undoubtedly deters foreign investment in this country. See Brief for Member States of European Communities et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 14-16. </i>These adverse consequences, which affect the Nation as a whole, result solely from California\'s refusal to conform its taxing practices to the internationally accepted standard.</p><p>Unlike the Court, see <i>ante, </i>at 319, I would not dismiss these difficulties solely by relying on our observation in <i>Container Corp. </i>that "it would be perverse, simply for the sake of avoiding double taxation, to require California to give up one allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes results in double taxation." 463 U. S., at 193. In addition to being factually incorrect, see id., at 199, n. 1 (Powell, J.,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="338">338</a></p><p>338 BARCLAYS BANK PLC <i>v. </i>FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.</p><p align="center">\nOpinion of O\'CONNOR, J.</p><p>dissenting), our discussion of alternatives in <i>Container Corp. </i>proceeded from the well-established proposition that States need not conform their taxing practices to those of their neighbors, at least so far as domestic commerce is concerned. See, <i>e. g., Moorman Mfg. Co. </i>v. <i>Bair, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/case.html">437 U. S. 267</a>, 277-281 (1978). Multiple taxation of domestic companies is avoided, to the extent necessary, by the fair apportionment requirement. See <i>Container Corp., supra, </i>at 185; <i>General Motors Corp. </i>v. <i>Washington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/436/case.html">377 U. S. 436</a>, 440 (1964).</p><p>But in <i>Japan Line </i>we squarely rejected the argument that the same principle applies to taxes imposed on foreignowned instrumentalities:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[N]either this Court nor this Nation can ensure full apportionment when one of the taxing entities is a foreign sovereign. If an instrumentality of commerce is domiciled abroad, the country of domicile may have the right, consistently with the custom of nations, to impose a tax on its full value. If a State should seek to tax the same instrumentality on an apportioned basis, multiple taxation inevitably results .... Due to the absence of an authoritative tribunal capable of ensuring that the aggregation of taxes is computed on no more than one full value, a state tax, even though \'fairly apportioned\' to reflect an instrumentality\'s presence within the State, may subject foreign commerce to the risk of a double tax burden to which [domestic] commerce is not exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids." 441 U. S., at 447-448 (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted).</p></blockquote><p>In my view, the risk of multiple taxation created by California\'s use of worldwide combined reporting-a risk that has materialized with respect to Barclays-is sufficient to render the California tax constitutionally infirm. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court\'s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
