CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Before the Act of Feb. 16, 1875, 18 Stat. 316, increasing the sum or value of the matter in dispute, necessary to give this court jurisdiction, from $2,000 to $5,000, after May 1, 1875, it was held that we had no jurisdiction in cases where the matter in dispute was $2,000, and no more, and that in determining the jurisdictional amount "neither interest on the judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 93 U. S. 567</a></p><p> nor costs of suit can enter into the computation."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/163/case.html#164">Walker v.

The act of 1875 simply increases the jurisdictional amount.  No other change is made in the old law.  The judgment in this case was rendered May 8, 1875, for $5,000 and no more, except costs.  It follows that, according to the practice established under the old law, this writ must be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
