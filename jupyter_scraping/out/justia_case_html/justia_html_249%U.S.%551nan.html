Ryan, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/375/case.html">249 U. S. 375</a></span>.</p>\n<p>When leave to file the petition for habeas corpus was previously denied without a suggestion as to the existence of any exceptional condition which would have justified a contrary view, such refusal presumably was based on the existence of the right to seek, if desired, other and appropriate sources of relief.  From this it follows that, although we pass the application of the doctrine that the refusal of habeas corpus is not the thing adjudged precluding a subsequent granting of such writ </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 249 U. S. 552</a></p><p> upon the same facts, nevertheless there is here no reason to grant the order prayed, since the previous order rested upon the right and duty to petition for relief, if habeas corpus was desired, to other and appropriate sources of judicial power.</p>\n<p>No reason therefore exists for granting the motion, and, to avoid any implication of a necessity which does not obtain, the motion is denied.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
