BELMONTES<br/>\n558 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ROBERT WONG, WARDEN <em>v.</em> FERNANDO\nBELMONTES, Jr.</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931263.\xe2\x80\x83Decided November 16, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmontes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in the head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759\xe2\x80\x93761, 755 P. 2d 310, 315\xe2\x80\x93316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his accomplices stole McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s stereo, sold it for $100, and used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night.  <em>Id</em>., at 764\xe2\x80\x93765, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 318\xe2\x80\x93319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas relief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we overturned that decision.<em> Ayers </em>v. <em>Belmontes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/7/index.html">549 U. S. 7</a> (2006); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Belmontes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/945/index.html">544 U. S. 945</a> (2005).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Belmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. The District Court had previously denied relief on that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had performed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but that Belmontes could not establish prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  <em>Belmontes </em>v. <em>Calderon</em>, Civ. S\xe2\x80\x9389\xe2\x80\x930736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a.  The Court of Appeals agreed that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to prejudice, determining that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors undermined confidence in the penalty phase verdict.  <em>Belmontes </em>v. <em>Ayers</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d 834, 859\xe2\x80\x93863, 874 (CA9 2008).  We disagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, and reverse. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.  To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 687.  To show deficient performance, Belmontes must establish that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 688.  In light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d the performance inquiry necessarily turns on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 688\xe2\x80\x93689.  At all points, \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance must be highly deferential.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 689.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The challenge confronting Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer, John Schick, was very specific.  Substantial evidence indicated that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during the penalty phase of the McConnell trial.  The evidence of the prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness testimony, Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 own admissions, and Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 possession of the murder weapon and the same type of ammunition used to kill the victim.  Record 2239\xe2\x80\x932250, 2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept. 26, 1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.  It would have shown that two years before Steacy McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s death, police found Jerry Howard\xe2\x80\x99s body in a secluded area.  Howard had been killed execution style, with a bullet to the back of the head.  The authorities suspected Belmontes, but on the eve of trial the State\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses refused to cooperate (Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 mother had begged one not to testify).  The prosecution therefore believed it could not prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.  What the prosecution could prove, even without the recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed the gun used to murder Howard.  So the State offered, and Belmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter.  Record 2239\xe2\x80\x932243; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the murder, boasting to several people that he had killed Howard.  Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney that Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police informant told detectives that Belmontes \xe2\x80\x9cbragged\xe2\x80\x9d about the murder, stating that he was \xe2\x80\x9cmad\xe2\x80\x9d at Howard because \xe2\x80\x9cthe night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t share it with him.\xe2\x80\x9d  After double jeopardy protection set in and he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted his responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the California Youth Authority, Charles Sapien.  During his time in confinement, Belmontes had \xe2\x80\x9calways denied that he was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.\xe2\x80\x9d  But because Sapien \xe2\x80\x9chad been square with [Belmontes],\xe2\x80\x9d Belmontes decided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling Sapien that he had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wasted\xe2\x80\x99 that guy.\xe2\x80\x9d Record 2240; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evidence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude it.  California evidentiary rules, Schick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the evidence, but those same rules made clear that the evidence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.  Record 2256; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez</em>, 42 Cal. 3d 730, 791\xe2\x80\x93792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris</em>, 28 Cal. 3d 935, 960\xe2\x80\x93962, 623 P.\xc2\xa02d 240, 254 (1981).  Schick thus had \xe2\x80\x9cgrave concerns\xe2\x80\x9d that, even if he succeeded initially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.  Accordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, structuring his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit that possibility.  Deposition of John Schick 301, 309\xe2\x80\x93310; see <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 699 (\xe2\x80\x9cRestricting testimony on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s character to what had come in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history, which counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come in\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit this evidence during the sentencing phase.  Schick moved to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.  Record 2240\xe2\x80\x932254.  Schick succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his client remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evidence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment <em>if</em> Schick opened the door.  <em>Id.</em>, at 2256.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was not an empty threat.  In one instance, Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent person.  The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury, argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with the Howard murder evidence.  <em>Id</em>., at 2332\xe2\x80\x932334.  The Court warned Schick that it was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to have to allow [the prosecution] to go into the whole background\xe2\x80\x9d if Schick continued his line of questioning.  <em>Id</em>., at 2334.  Schick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s warning reinforced Schick\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully to preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder evidence.  With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for mitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder evidence.  See <em>id</em>., at 2312\xe2\x80\x932417.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these efforts, Schick\xe2\x80\x99s performance was constitutionally deficient under Circuit precedent.  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 862\xe2\x80\x93863.  The State challenges that conclusion, but we need not resolve the point, because we agree with the District Court that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 694.  That showing requires Belmontes to establish \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigating evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat had the jury been confronted with this \xe2\x80\xa6 mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it would have returned with a different sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 535, 536 (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably competent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evidence, on top of what Schick had already presented.  For purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclusion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable probability that a jury presented with this additional mitigation evidence would have returned a different verdict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider <em>all</em> the relevant evidence that the jury would have had before it if Schick had pursued the different path\xe2\x80\x94not just the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly would have come in with it.  See <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 695\xe2\x80\x93696, 700.  Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes must show a reasonable probability that the jury would have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire body of mitigating evidence (including the additional testimony Schick could have presented) against the entire body of aggravating evidence (including the Howard murder evidence).  Belmontes cannot meet this burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did present during the sentencing phase.  That evidence was substantial.  The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the same record in Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 first habeas appeal agreed, recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe substantial nature of the mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d Schick presented.  <em>Belmontes </em>v. <em>Woodford</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d 861, 907 (2003).  It reiterated the point several times.  See <em>id</em>., at 874, 901, 908.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a span of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  A number of those witnesses highlighted Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cterrible\xe2\x80\x9d childhood.  They testified that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.  Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 grandfather described the one-bedroom house where Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a \xe2\x80\x9cchicken coop.\xe2\x80\x9d  Belmontes did not do well in school; he dropped out in the ninth grade.  His younger sister died when she was only 10 months old.  And his grandmother died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.  See Record 2314\xe2\x80\x932319, 2324\xe2\x80\x932325, 2344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Family members also testified that, despite these difficulties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister.  <em>Id</em>., at 2317\xe2\x80\x932318, 2325\xe2\x80\x932326.  And Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 best friend offered the insights of a close friend and confidant.  <em>Id</em>., at 2329\xe2\x80\x932332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 religious conversion while in state custody on the accessory charge.  These witnesses told stories about Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 efforts advising other inmates in his detention center\xe2\x80\x99s religious program, to illustrate that he could live a productive and meaningful life in prison.  They described his success working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his rise from lowest man on the team to second in command.  Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 assistant chaplain even said that he would use Belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling program if the jury handed down a life sentence.  <em>Id</em>., at 2379\xe2\x80\x932384, 2396\xe2\x80\x932398, 2400\xe2\x80\x932407.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying about his childhood and religious conversion, both at sentencing and during allocution.  Belmontes described his childhood as \xe2\x80\x9cpretty hard,\xe2\x80\x9d but took responsibility for his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his background \xe2\x80\x9cas a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now \xe2\x80\xa6 because of that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 2343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94addressing Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 ineffective assistance claim for the first time\xe2\x80\x94changed its view of this evidence.  Instead of finding Schick\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation case \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d as it previously had, <em>Belmontes</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit this time around labeled it \xe2\x80\x9ccursory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 841, 861, n.\xc2\xa014, 866.  Compare also <em>Belmontes</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence Schick presented \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence \xe2\x80\x9cinsubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d).  More evidence, the Court of Appeals now concluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more evidence to \xe2\x80\x9chumanize\xe2\x80\x9d Belmontes, as that court put it no fewer than 11 times in its opinion.  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n.\xc2\xa018, 869, 872, 874.  The Court determined that the failure to put on this evidence prejudiced Belmontes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of the evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing evidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was already there would have made little difference.  Other evidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put into play aspects of Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 character that would have triggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in rebuttal.  This evidence would have made a difference, but in the wrong direction for Belmontes.  In either event, Belmontes cannot establish <em>Strickland</em> prejudice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the cumulative evidence.  In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing evidence about Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult childhood\xe2\x80\x9d and highlighted his \xe2\x80\x9cpositive attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 864.  As for his difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses to testify that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Belmontes was five years old, his 10-month-old sister died of a brain tumor,\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cexhibited symptoms of depression\xe2\x80\x9d after her death, that his grandmother suffered from \xe2\x80\x9calcoholism and prescription drug addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d and that both his immediate and extended family lived in a state of \xe2\x80\x9cconstant strife.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  As for his positive attributes, Schick should have produced testimony about Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cstrong character as a child in the face of adversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Schick should have illustrated that Belmontes was \xe2\x80\x9ckind, responsible, and likeable\xe2\x80\x9d; that he \xe2\x80\x9cgot along well with his siblings\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9crespectful towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his mixed racial background\xe2\x80\x9d; and that he \xe2\x80\x9cparticipated in community activities, kept up in school and got along with his teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But as recounted above and recognized by the state courts and, originally, this very panel, Schick <em>did</em> put on substantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the same \xe2\x80\x9chumanizing\xe2\x80\x9d theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid</em>., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month-old sister); <em>id</em>., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); <em>id</em>., at 2314\xe2\x80\x932315 (family member\xe2\x80\x99s addictions); <em>id</em>., at<em> </em>2314\xe2\x80\x932315, 2324\xe2\x80\x932325 (family strife and abuse); <em>id</em>., at 2317, 2319, 2347\xe2\x80\x932348, 2397 (strong character as a child); <em>id</em>., at 2326\xe2\x80\x932327 (close relationship with siblings); <em>id</em>., at 2317\xe2\x80\x932319 (close relationship with grandparents); <em>id</em>., at 2348\xe2\x80\x932351 (participation in community religious events); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 Traverse to Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Return to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5\xe2\x80\x9389\xe2\x80\x930736\xe2\x80\x93EJG\xe2\x80\x93JFM (ED Cal.), p.\xc2\xa064 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ounsel\xe2\x80\x99s presentation was arguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of \xe2\x80\x98humanizing\xe2\x80\x99 petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d).  The sentencing jury was thus \xe2\x80\x9cwell acquainted\xe2\x80\x9d with Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 background and potential humanizing features.  <em>Schriro </em>v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U. S. 465</a>, 481 (2007).  Additional evidence on these points would have offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evidence Schick presented and the additional evidence it proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had submitted expert testimony.  Such testimony could \xe2\x80\x9cmake connections between the various themes in the mitigation case and explain to the jury how they could have contributed to Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in criminal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 853.  See also <em>ibid</em>. (discussing expert\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert testimony).  But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth Circuit would have required Schick to present was neither complex nor technical.  It required only that the jury make logical connections of the kind a layperson is well equipped to make.  The jury simply did not need expert testimony to understand the \xe2\x80\x9chumanizing\xe2\x80\x9d evidence; it could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 mental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it in some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes to the Howard evidence.  See <em>Darden</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/168/index.html">477 U. S. 168</a>, 186 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny attempt to portray petitioner as a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the State to rebut with evidence of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to put on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they would have been faced with his admission at trial that, although still married, he was spending the weekend furlough with a girlfriend\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes had a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98high likelihood of a \xe2\x80\xa6 nonviolent adjustment to a prison setting,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as Belmontes suggested an expert might, see Brief for Appellant in No. 01\xe2\x80\x9399018 (CA9), p.\xc2\xa034, the question would have immediately arisen: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his propensity toward violence to begin with?  Does evidence of another murder alter your view?\xe2\x80\x9d  Expert testimony explaining <em>why</em> the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed simply to facts that might elicit that response, would have led to a similar rejoinder: \xe2\x80\x9cIs such sympathy equally appropriate for someone who committed a second murder?\xe2\x80\x9d  Any of this testimony from an expert\xe2\x80\x99s perspective would have made the Howard evidence fair game.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many of Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 other arguments fail for the same reason.  He argues that the jury should have been told that he suffered an \xe2\x80\x9cextended bout with rheumatic fever,\xe2\x80\x9d which led to \xe2\x80\x9cemotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 120.  But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard murder and Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent bragging about it would have served as a powerful counterpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The type of \xe2\x80\x9cmore-evidence-is-better\xe2\x80\x9d approach advocated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem appealing\xe2\x80\x94after all, what is there to lose?  But here there was a lot to lose.  A heavyhanded case to portray Belmontes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have invited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal\xe2\x80\x94the evidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but two murders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigating evidence might not have opened the door to the prior murder evidence.  The Court of Appeals went so far as to state, without citation, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here would be no basis for suggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different if the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two murders rather than one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 869, n.\xc2\xa020.  But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testimony \xe2\x80\x9cexplain[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 involvement in criminal activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.  And even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as the Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that <em>these</em> two murders were so different in character made each of them highly pertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envisioned by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick opened the door.  <em>Id.</em>, at 869\xe2\x80\x93870, n.\xc2\xa020.  If Schick had doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have secured an answer in advance through a motion <em>in limine</em>. <em> Ibid</em>.  The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he stood.  While ruling that the prosecution could not present the evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge made clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal purposes, <em>id</em>., at 2256, 2332\xe2\x80\x932334.  When Schick elicited testimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example, the judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he would admit the Howard murder evidence\xe2\x80\x94to let the prosecution \xe2\x80\x9cgo into the whole background\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if Schick pressed forward.  <em>Id</em>., at 2334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggravators, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the aggravating evidence the State presented as \xe2\x80\x9cscant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878.  That characterization misses <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s point that the reviewing court must consider all the evidence\xe2\x80\x94the good and the bad\xe2\x80\x94when evaluating prejudice.  See <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 695\xe2\x80\x93696, 700.  Here, the worst kind of bad evidence would have come in with the good.  The only reason it did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation case.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s aggravation evidence could only be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cscant\xe2\x80\x9d if one ignores the \xe2\x80\x9celephant in the courtroom\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 role in the Howard murder\xe2\x80\x94that would have been presented had Schick submitted the additional mitigation evidence.  <em>Belmontes</em> v. <em>Ayers</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even on the record before it\xe2\x80\x94which did not include the Howard murder\xe2\x80\x94the state court determined that Belmontes \xe2\x80\x9cwas convicted on extremely strong evidence that he committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belmontes</em>, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.  That court also noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he properly admitted aggravating evidence in this case\xe2\x80\x94in particular, the circumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x94was simply overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 809, 755 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 348 (citation omitted).  The Ninth Circuit saw the murder differently.  It viewed the circumstances of the crime as only \xe2\x80\x9cconceivably significant\xe2\x80\x9d as an aggravating factor.  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 871.  In particular, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he crime here did not involve \xe2\x80\xa6 needless suffering on the part of the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve \xe2\x80\x9cneedless suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury saw autopsy photographs showing Steacy McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s mangled head, her skull crushed by 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found to have been wielded by Belmontes.  McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s corpse showed numerous \xe2\x80\x9cdefensive bruises and contusions on [her] hands, arms, and feet,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 839, which \xe2\x80\x9cplainly evidenced a desperate struggle for life at [Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99] hands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Belmontes</em>, 755 P. 2d, at 354.  Belmontes left McConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for her life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries caused by the blows from Belmontes.  Record 3.  The jury also heard that this savage murder was committed solely to prevent interference with a burglary that netted Belmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.  McConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of the error below may be traced to confusion about the appropriate standard and burden of proof.  While the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language from <em>Strickland</em>, that court elsewhere suggested it might have applied something different.<em> </em> In explaining its prejudice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he aggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence that Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough, in light of the mitigating evidence that could have been adduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belmontes</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 875.  But <em>Strickland</em> does not require the State to \xe2\x80\x9crule out\xe2\x80\x9d a sentence of life in prison to prevail.  Rather, <em>Strickland</em> places the burden on the defendant, not the State, to show a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the result would have been different.  466 U. S., at 694.  Under a proper application of the <em>Strickland</em> standard, Belmontes cannot carry this burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is hard to imagine expert testimony and <em>additional</em> facts about Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 difficult childhood outweighing the facts of McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  It becomes even harder to envision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes had committed another murder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe most powerful imaginable aggravating evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d as Judge Levi put it, <em>Belmontes</em>, S-89\xe2\x80\x930736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a\xe2\x80\x94is added to the mix.  Schick\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation strategy failed, but the notion that the result could have been different if only Schick had put on more than the nine witnesses he did, or called expert witnesses to bolster his case, is fanciful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963044">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n558 U.

See <em>Ayers</em> v. <em>Belmontes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/7/index.html">549 U. S. 7</a>, 27 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The trial judge who presided at Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing hearing so understood the law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that understanding.  See <em>id</em>., at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  It was only later that both the California Supreme Court and this Court squarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to any aspect of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or history that may provide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if such evidence does not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tend to reduce the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for his crime.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 28 (quoting <em>Skipper</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/index.html">476 U.

Neither his own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the other witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any attempt to extenuate the severity of his crime.  Their testimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis for imposing a sentence other than death.  See <em>Ayers,</em> 549 U. S., at 29\xe2\x80\x9331 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  A review of the entire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors and the trial judge, makes it clear to me that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence any weight at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 36\xe2\x80\x9339.  I therefore remain convinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of Appeals correctly set aside Belmontes\xe2\x80\x99 death sentence. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The narrow question that is now before us is whether the additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed to uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a different verdict.  The evidence trial counsel might have presented hardly matters, however, because in my view the conscientious jurors\xe2\x80\x99 mistaken understanding of the law would have prevented them from giving that additional evidence \xe2\x80\x9cany weight at all,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 39, let alone controlling weight.  Despite my strong disagreement with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to review this case once again, I nevertheless agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present additional mitigating evidence probably did not affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Cal.
