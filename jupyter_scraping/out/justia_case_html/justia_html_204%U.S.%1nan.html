S. 6</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is not a case involving the rights of creditors or of minority stockholders as such, but a case raising the bare question to whom assets remaining on a valid reduction of the capital stock of a national bank belong.</p>\n<p>The National Banking Act (Title LXII, Rev.Stat.) provides:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 5143.  Any association formed under this title may, by the vote of shareholders owning two-thirds of its capital stock, reduce its capital to any sum not below the amount </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 204 U. S. 7</a></p><p> required by this title to authorize the formation of associations; but no such reduction shall be allowable which will reduce the capital of the association below the amount required for its outstanding circulation, nor shall any such reduction be made until the amount of the proposed reduction has been reported to the Comptroller of the Currency, and his approval thereof obtained."</p>\n<p>The reduction in this case was accomplished at a time when the bank was not being wound up, by the required vote of the stockholders, and with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the new shares on the basis of the reduction were accepted by all the stockholders.</p>\n<p>The bank was left with good assets of more than $240,000, or, in other words, with an unimpaired capital stock of $200,000 and a surplus of 20 percent -- that is, $40,000, exclusive of the assets, the distribution of which is the matter in controversy.  These assets were set apart in compliance with the requirement of the Comptroller that certain bad, doubtful, and unproductive assets should be charged off or set aside for the benefit of those who were stockholders at the date of the approval.  This requirement, though not stated in the certificate of approval, was evidently, on the facts, made a condition thereof, and presumably in accordance with the practice of the Comptroller\'s office, and was imposed to the end that justice might be done to the owners of the original shares.</p>\n<p>It is said that the original capital of the bank of $300,000 was impaired prior to the reduction, say to the extent of $30,000, as shown by adding to the $240,000 the value of the scheduled assets, estimated at $30,000.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, it may be admitted that, where capital stock is impaired and a reduction is made merely to meet that impairment, there can be no distribution.  But that is not this case, in which the stockholders of record June 9, 1900, had a right to require a distribution among them of an excess upon reduction in proportion to their respective holdings.  In the language of the Connecticut Supreme Court:</p>\n<p>"The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 204 U. S. 8</a></p><p> right to receive what might ultimately be realized from the fund thus set apart became therefore irrevocably vested in those who were shareholders on June ninth, 1900, and they or their assigns are now entitled to whatever is to be distributed from it."</p>\n<p>It follows, as held, that the transfer of shares after the reduction of June 9, 1900, did not carry any right to an interest in the special trust fund, the proportionate interest therein having vested in the then shareholders as individuals.  The result is unaffected by the fact that distribution in cash may have been contemplated as the assets set aside were realized upon.</p>\n<p>The conclusion at which we have arrived dispenses with the necessity of discussing other questions suggested.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
