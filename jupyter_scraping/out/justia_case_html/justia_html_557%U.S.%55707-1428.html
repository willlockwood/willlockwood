(City), uses objective examinations to identify those firefighters best qualified for promotion.  When the results of such an exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous public debate ensued.  Confronted with arguments both for and against certifying the test results\xe2\x80\x94and threats of a lawsuit either way\xe2\x80\x94the City threw out the results based on the statistical racial disparity.  Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the City\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials, alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them based on their race in violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The defendants responded that had they certified the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The City\xe2\x80\x99s action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate impact).  Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disparate impact, the employer may defend by demonstrating that its\npolicy or practice is \xe2\x80\x9cjob related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the employer meets that burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate needs.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis begins with the premise that the City\xe2\x80\x99s actions would violate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment prohibition absent some valid defense.  All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected the test results because<em> </em>the higher scoring candidates were white.  Without some other justification, this express, race-based decisionmaking is prohibited.  The question, therefore, is whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.  The Court has considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Protection Clause.  Such cases can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context.  See <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U. S. 977</a>, 993.  In those cases, the Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial discrimination\xe2\x80\x94actions that are themselves based on race\xe2\x80\x94are constitutional only where there is a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the remedial actions were necessary.  <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 500; see also <em>Wygant</em> v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 277.  In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the <em>Wygant</em> plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segregation and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other.  476 U. S., at 277.  It reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]videntiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions.   Applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.  It also allows the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consistent with other Title VII provisions, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores based on race, see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>), and the section that expressly protects bona fide promotional exams, see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(h).  Thus, the Court adopts the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction in order to resolve any conflict between Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9326. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The City\xe2\x80\x99s race-based rejection of the test results cannot satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence standard.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9334. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The racial adverse impact in this litigation was significant, and petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima facie<em> </em>case of disparate-impact liability.  The problem for respondents is that such a prima facie case\xe2\x80\x94essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, <em>Connecticut</em> v. <em>Teal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/440/index.html">457 U. S. 440</a>, 446, and nothing more\xe2\x80\x94is far from a strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the test results.  That is because the City could be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally valid, less discriminatory alternative that served the City\xe2\x80\x99s needs but that the City refused to adopt.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A), (C).  Based on the record the parties developed through discovery, there is no substantial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9328.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The City\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that the exams at issue were not job related and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contradicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to develop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the questions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieutenant positions.  The testimony also shows that complaints that certain examination questions were contradictory or did not specifically apply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that the City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams\xe2\x80\x99 validity.  Pp.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an equally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by certifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 three arguments to the contrary all fail.  First, respondents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation would have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then-open positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the candidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the different weighting would be an equally valid way to determine whether candidates are qualified for promotions.  Second, respondents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpretation of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less discriminatory results; but respondents\xe2\x80\x99 approach would have violated Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>).  Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assessment center to evaluate candidates\xe2\x80\x99 behavior in typical job tasks would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for the exams at issue.  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) statements in the record.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9333.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iv)\xc2\xa0Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the City\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions.  Discarding the test results was impermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment claim.  If, after it certifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

An agency\xe2\x80\x99s officers command respect within the department and in the whole community; and, of course, added responsibilities command increased salary and benefits.  Aware of the intense competition for promotions, New Haven, like many cities, relies on objective examinations to identify the best qualified candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took examinations to qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or captain.  Promotion examinations in New Haven (or City) were infrequent, so the stakes were high.  The results would determine which firefighters would be considered for promotions during the next two years, and the order in which they would be considered.  Many firefighters studied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the examination results showed that white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor and other local politicians opened a public debate that turned rancorous.  Some firefighters argued the tests should be discarded because the results showed the tests to be discriminatory.  They threatened a discrimination lawsuit if the City made promotions based on the tests.  Other firefighters said the exams were neutral and fair.  And they, in turn, threatened a discrimination lawsuit if the City, relying on the statistical racial disparity, ignored the test results and denied promotions to the candidates who had performed well.  In the end the City took the side of those who protested the test results.  It threw out the examinations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely would have been promoted based on their good test performance sued the City and some of its officials.  Theirs is the suit now before us.  The suit alleges that, by discarding the test results, the City and the named officials discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race, in violation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq.</em>, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The City and the officials defended their actions, arguing that if they had certified the results, they could have faced liability under Title VII for adopting a practice that had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that race-based action like the City\xe2\x80\x99s in this case is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer can demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that, had it not taken the action, it would have been liable under the disparate-impact statute.  The respondents, we further determine, cannot meet that threshold standard.  As a result, the City\xe2\x80\x99s action in discarding the tests was a violation of Title VII.  In light of our ruling under the statutes, we need not reach the question whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 actions may have violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This litigation comes to us after the parties\xe2\x80\x99 cross-motions for summary judgment, so we set out the facts in some detail.  As the District Court noted, although \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties strenuously dispute the relevance and legal import of, and inferences to be drawn from, many aspects of this case, the underlying facts are largely undisputed.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 142, 145 (Conn. 2006).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the City of New Haven undertook to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions in its fire department (Department), the promotion and hiring process was governed by the city charter, in addition to federal and state law.  The charter establishes a merit system.  That system requires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil-service ranks with the most qualified individuals, as determined by job-related examinations.  After each examination, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies a ranked list of applicants who passed the test. Under the charter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crule of three,\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant hiring authority must fill each vacancy by choosing one candidate from the top three scorers on the list.  Certified promotional lists remain valid for two years.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City\xe2\x80\x99s contract with the New Haven firefighters\xe2\x80\x99 union specifies additional requirements for the promotion process.  Under the contract, applicants for lieutenant and captain positions were to be screened using written and oral examinations, with the written exam accounting for 60 percent and the oral exam 40 percent of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s total score.  To sit for the examinations, candidates for lieutenant needed 30 months\xe2\x80\x99 experience in the Department, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational training courses.  Candidates for captain needed one year\xe2\x80\x99s service as a lieutenant in the Department, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational training courses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reviewing bids from various consultants, the City hired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to develop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the City of $100,000.  IOS is an Illinois company that specializes in designing entry-level and promotional examinations for fire and police departments.  In order to fit the examinations to the New Haven Department, IOS began the test-design process by performing job analyses to identify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are essential for the lieutenant and captain positions.  IOS representatives interviewed incumbent captains and lieutenants and their supervisors.  They rode with and observed other on-duty officers.  Using information from those interviews and ride-alongs, IOS wrote job-analysis questionnaires and administered them to most of the incumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in the Department.  At every stage of the job analyses, IOS, by deliberate choice, oversampled minority firefighters to ensure that the results\xe2\x80\x94which IOS would use to develop the examinations\xe2\x80\x94would not unintentionally favor white candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the job-analysis information in hand, IOS developed the written examinations to measure the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 job-related knowledge.  For each test, IOS compiled a list of training manuals, Department procedures, and other materials to use as sources for the test questions.  IOS presented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire chief and assistant fire chief for their approval.  Then, using the approved sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice test for each position.  Each test had 100 questions, as required by CSB rules, and was written below a 10th-grade reading level.  After IOS prepared the tests, the City opened a 3-month study period.  It gave candidates a list that identified the source material for the questions, including the specific chapters from which the questions were taken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IOS developed the oral examinations as well.  These concentrated on job skills and abilities.  Using the job-analysis information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to test incident-command skills, firefighting tactics, interpersonal skills, leadership, and management ability, among other things.  Candidates would be presented with these hypotheticals and asked to respond before a panel of three assessors.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior in rank to the positions being tested.  At the City\xe2\x80\x99s insistence (because of controversy surrounding previous examinations), all the assessors came from outside Connecticut.  IOS submitted the assessors\xe2\x80\x99 resumes to City officials for approval.  They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs, and chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s throughout the country.  Sixty-six percent of the panelists were minorities, and each of the nine three-member assessment panels contained two minority members.  IOS trained the panelists for several hours on the day before it administered the examinations, teaching them how to score the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 responses consistently using checklists of desired criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Candidates took the examinations in November and December 2003.  Seventy-seven candidates completed the lieutenant examination\xe2\x80\x9443 whites, 19 blacks, and 15 Hispanics.  Of those, 34 candidates passed\xe2\x80\x9425 whites, 6 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 145.  Eight lieutenant positions were vacant at the time of the examination.  As the rule of three operated, this meant that the top 10 candidates were eligible for an immediate promotion to lieutenant.  All 10 were white.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Subsequent vacancies would have allowed at least 3 black candidates to be considered for promotion to lieutenant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Forty-one candidates completed the captain examination\xe2\x80\x9425 whites, 8 blacks, and 8 Hispanics.  Of those, 22 candidates passed\xe2\x80\x9416 whites, 3 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Seven captain positions were vacant at the time of the examination.  Under the rule of three, 9 candidates were eligible for an immediate promotion to captain\xe2\x80\x947 whites and 2 Hispanics.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City\xe2\x80\x99s contract with IOS contemplated that, after the examinations, IOS would prepare a technical report that described the examination processes and methodologies and analyzed the results.  But in January 2004, rather than requesting the technical report, City officials, including the City\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, Thomas Ude, convened a meeting with IOS Vice President Chad Legel.  (Legel was the leader of the IOS team that developed and administered the tests.)  Based on the test results, the City officials expressed concern that the tests had discriminated against minority candidates.  Legel defended the examinations\xe2\x80\x99 validity, stating that any numerical disparity between white and minority candidates was likely due to various external factors and was in line with results of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s previous promotional examinations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several days after the meeting, Ude sent a letter to the CSB purporting to outline its duties with respect to the examination results.  Ude stated that under federal law, \xe2\x80\x9ca statistical demonstration of disparate impact,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a sufficiently serious claim of racial discrimination to serve as a predicate for employer-initiated, voluntar[y] remedies\xe2\x80\x94even \xe2\x80\xa6 race-conscious remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931428, p. 443a; see also 554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 145 (issue of disparate impact \xe2\x80\x9cappears to have been raised by \xe2\x80\xa6 Ude\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSB first met to consider certifying the results on January 22, 2004.

Frank Ricci stated that the test questions were based on the Department\xe2\x80\x99s own rules and procedures and on \xe2\x80\x9cnationally recognized\xe2\x80\x9d materials that represented the \xe2\x80\x9caccepted standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for firefighting.  <em>Id.</em>, at A785\xe2\x80\x93A786.  Ricci stated that he had \xe2\x80\x9cseveral learning disabilities,\xe2\x80\x9d including dyslexia; that he had spent more than $1,000 to purchase the materials and pay his neighbor to read them on tape so he could \xe2\x80\x9cgive it [his] best shot\xe2\x80\x9d; and that he had studied \xe2\x80\x9c8 to 13 hours a day to prepare\xe2\x80\x9d for the test.  <em>Id.</em>, at A786, A789.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if I made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ricci told the CSB, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ut the people who passed should be promoted.  When your life\xe2\x80\x99s on the line, second best may not be good enough.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A787\xe2\x80\x93A788.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other firefighters spoke against certifying the test results.  They described the test questions as outdated or not relevant to firefighting practices in New Haven.  Gary Tinney stated that source materials \xe2\x80\x9ccame out of New York. . . . Their makeup of their city and everything is totally different than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A774\xe2\x80\x93A775; see also <em>id.</em>, at A779, A780\xe2\x80\x93A781.  And they criticized the test materials, a full set of which cost about $500, for being too expensive and too long.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a second CSB meeting, on February 5, the president of the New Haven firefighters\xe2\x80\x99 union asked the CSB to perform a validation study to determine whether the tests were job-related.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 counsel in this action argued that the CSB should certify the results.  A representative of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, Donald Day from neighboring Bridgeport, Connecticut, \xe2\x80\x9cbeseech[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the CSB \xe2\x80\x9cto throw away that test,\xe2\x80\x9d which he described as \xe2\x80\x9cinherently unfair\xe2\x80\x9d because of the racial distribution of the results.  <em>Id.</em>, at A830\xe2\x80\x93A831.  Another Bridgeport-based representative of the association, Ronald Mackey, stated that a validation study was necessary.  He suggested that the City could \xe2\x80\x9cadjust\xe2\x80\x9d the test results to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet the criteria of having a certain amount of minorities get elevated to the rank of Lieutenant and Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A838.  At the end of this meeting, the CSB members agreed to ask IOS to send a representative to explain how it had developed and administered the examinations.  They also discussed asking a panel of experts to review the examinations and advise the CSB whether to certify the results.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a third meeting, on February 11, Legel addressed the CSB on behalf of IOS.  Legel stated that IOS had previously prepared entry-level firefighter examinations for the City but not a promotional examination.  He explained that IOS had developed examinations for departments in communities with demographics similar to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s, including Orange County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and San Jose, California.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legel explained the exam-development process to the CSB.  He began by describing the job analyses IOS performed of the captain and lieutenant positions\xe2\x80\x94the interviews, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to \xe2\x80\x9cgenerate a list of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities that are considered essential to performance\xe2\x80\x9d of the jobs.  <em>Id.</em>, at A931\xe2\x80\x93A932.  He outlined how IOS prepared the written and oral examinations, based on the job-analysis results, to test most heavily those qualities that the results indicated were \xe2\x80\x9ccritica[l]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cessentia[l].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A931.  And he noted that IOS took the material for each test question directly from the approved source materials.  Legel told the CSB that third-party reviewers had scrutinized the examinations to ensure that the written test was drawn from the source material and that the oral test accurately tested real-world situations that captains and lieutenants would face.  Legel confirmed that IOS had selected oral-examination panelists so that each three-member assessment panel included one white, one black, and one Hispanic member.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Near the end of his remarks, Legel \xe2\x80\x9cimplor[ed] anyone that had \xe2\x80\xa6 concerns to review the content of the exam.  In my professional opinion, it\xe2\x80\x99s facially neutral.  There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in those examinations \xe2\x80\xa6 that should cause somebody to think that one group would perform differently than another group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A961.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the next meeting, on March 11, the CSB heard from three witnesses it had selected to \xe2\x80\x9ctell us a little bit about their views of the testing, the process, [and] the methodology.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1020.  The first, Christopher Hornick, spoke to the CSB by telephone.  Hornick is an industrial/organizational psychologist from Texas who operates a consulting business that \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d competes with IOS.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1029.  Hornick, who had not \xe2\x80\x9cstud[ied] the test at length or in detail\xe2\x80\x9d and had not \xe2\x80\x9cseen the job analysis data,\xe2\x80\x9d told the CSB that the scores indicated a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively high adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1028, A1030, A1043.  He stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ormally, whites outperform ethnic minorities on the majority of standardized testing procedures,\xe2\x80\x9d but that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca little surprised\xe2\x80\x9d by the disparity in the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 scores\xe2\x80\x94although \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome of it is fairly typical of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in other areas of the countr[y] and other tests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1028\xe2\x80\x93A1029.  Hornick stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cadverse impact on the written exam was somewhat higher but generally in the range that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen professionally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1030\xe2\x80\x93A1031.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When asked to explain the New Haven test results, Hornick opined in the telephone conversation that the collective-bargaining agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of using written and oral examinations with a 60/40 composite score might account for the statistical disparity.  He also stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y not having anyone from within the [D]epartment review\xe2\x80\x9d the tests before they were administered\xe2\x80\x94a limitation the City had imposed to protect the security of the exam questions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou inevitably get things in there\xe2\x80\x9d that are based on the source materials but are not relevant to New Haven.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1034\xe2\x80\x93A1035.  Hornick suggested that testing candidates at an \xe2\x80\x9cassessment center\xe2\x80\x9d rather than using written and oral examinations \xe2\x80\x9cmight serve [the City\xe2\x80\x99s] needs better.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1039\xe2\x80\x93A1040.  Hornick stated that assessment centers, where candidates face real-world situations and respond just as they would in the field, allow candidates \xe2\x80\x9cto demonstrate how they would address a particular problem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option on a written test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hornick made clear that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot suggesting that [IOS] somehow created a test that had adverse impacts that it should not have had.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1038.  He described the IOS examinations as \xe2\x80\x9creasonably good test[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1041.  He stated that the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s best option might be to \xe2\x80\x9ccertify the list as it exists\xe2\x80\x9d and work to change the process for future tests, including by \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ewriting the Civil Service Rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Hornick concluded his telephonic remarks by telling the CSB that \xe2\x80\x9cfor the future,\xe2\x80\x9d his company \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly would like to help you if we can.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1046.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second witness was Vincent Lewis, a fire program specialist for the Department of Homeland Security and a retired fire captain from Michigan.  Lewis, who is black, had looked \xe2\x80\x9cextensively\xe2\x80\x9d at the lieutenant exam and \xe2\x80\x9ca little less extensively\xe2\x80\x9d at the captain exam.  He stated that the candidates \xe2\x80\x9cshould know that material.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1048, A1052.  In Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s view, the \xe2\x80\x9cquestions were relevant for both exams,\xe2\x80\x9d and the New Haven candidates had an advantage because the study materials identified the particular book chapters from which the questions were taken.  In other departments, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had to know basically the \xe2\x80\xa6 entire book.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1053.  Lewis concluded that any disparate impact likely was due to a pattern that \xe2\x80\x9cusually whites outperform some of the minorities on testing,\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9cmore whites \xe2\x80\xa6 take the exam.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1054.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final witness was Janet Helms, a professor at Boston College whose \xe2\x80\x9cprimary area of expertise\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cnot with firefighters per se\xe2\x80\x9d but in \xe2\x80\x9crace and culture as they influence performance on tests and other assessment procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1060.  Helms expressly declined the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s offer to review the examinations.  At the outset, she noted that \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of what kind of written test we give in this country \xe2\x80\xa6 we can just about predict how many people will pass who are members of under-represented groups.  And your data are not that inconsistent with what predictions would say were the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1061.  Helms nevertheless offered several \xe2\x80\x9cideas about what might be possible factors\xe2\x80\x9d to explain statistical differences in the results.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1062.  She concluded that because 67 percent of the respondents to the job-analysis questionnaires were white, the test questions might have favored white candidates, because \xe2\x80\x9cmost of the literature on firefighters shows that the different groups perform the job differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1063.  Helms closed by stating that no matter what test the City had administered, it would have revealed \xe2\x80\x9ca disparity between blacks and whites, Hispanics and whites,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly on a written test.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1072.</p>\n<p align="left">5</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the final CSB meeting, on March 18, Ude (the City\xe2\x80\x99s counsel) argued against certifying the examination results.  Discussing the City\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under federal law, Ude advised the CSB that a finding of adverse impact \xe2\x80\x9cis the beginning, not the end, of a review of testing procedures\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether they violated the disparate-impact provision of Title VII.  Ude focused the CSB on determining \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there are other ways to test for \xe2\x80\xa6 those positions that are equally valid with less adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1101.  Ude described Hornick as having said that the written examination \xe2\x80\x9chad one of the most severe adverse impacts that he had seen\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are much better alternatives to identifying [firefighting] skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Ude offered his \xe2\x80\x9copinion that promotions \xe2\x80\xa6 as a result of these tests would not be consistent with federal law, would not be consistent with the purposes of our Civil Service Rules or our Charter[,] nor is it in the best interests of the firefighters \xe2\x80\xa6 who took the exams.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1103\xe2\x80\x93A1104.  He stated that previous Department exams \xe2\x80\x9chave not had this kind of result,\xe2\x80\x9d and that previous results had not been \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged as having adverse impact, whereas we are assured that these will be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1107, A1108.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CSB Chairman Segaloff asked Ude several questions about the Title VII disparate-impact standard.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: [M]y understanding is the group \xe2\x80\xa6 that is making to throw the exam out has the burden of showing that there is out there an exam that is reasonably probable or likely to have less of an adverse impact.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not our burden to show that there\xe2\x80\x99s an exam out there that can be better.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got an exam.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a result\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR. UDE: Mr. Chair, I point out that Dr. Hornick said that.  He said that there are other tests out there that would have less adverse impact and that [would] be more valid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: You think that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for us to throw this test upside-down \xe2\x80\xa6 because Dr. Hornick said it?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR. UDE: I think that by itself would be sufficient.  Yes.  I also would point out that \xe2\x80\xa6 it is the employer\xe2\x80\x99s burden to justify the use of the examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1108\xe2\x80\x93A1109.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Karen DuBois-Walton, the City\xe2\x80\x99s chief administrative officer, spoke on behalf of Mayor John DeStefano and argued against certifying the results.  DuBois-Walton stated that the results, when considered under the rule of three and applied to then-existing captain and lieutenant vacancies, created a situation in which black and Hispanic candidates were disproportionately excluded from opportunity.  DuBois-Walton also relied on Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, asserting that Hornick \xe2\x80\x9cmade it extremely clear that \xe2\x80\xa6 there are more appropriate ways to assess one\xe2\x80\x99s ability to serve\xe2\x80\x9d as a captain or lieutenant.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1120.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Burgett (the human resources director) asked the CSB to discard the examination results.  She, too, relied on Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s statement to show the existence of alternative testing methods, describing Hornick as having \xe2\x80\x9cstarted to point out that alternative testing does exist\xe2\x80\x9d and as having \xe2\x80\x9cbegun to suggest that there are some different ways of doing written examinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1125, A1128.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other witnesses addressed the CSB.  They included the president of the New Haven firefighters\xe2\x80\x99 union, who supported certification.  He reminded the CSB that Hornick \xe2\x80\x9calso concluded that the tests were reasonable and fair and under the current structure to certify them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1137.  Firefighter Frank Ricci again argued for certification; he stated that although \xe2\x80\x9cassessment centers in some cases show less adverse impact,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at A1140, they were not available alternatives for the current round of promotions.  It would take several years, Ricci explained, for the Department to develop an assessment-center protocol and the accompanying training materials.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1141.  Lieutenant Matthew Marcarelli, who had taken the captain\xe2\x80\x99s exam, spoke in favor of certification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the close of witness testimony, the CSB voted on a motion to certify the examinations.  With one member recused, the CSB deadlocked 2 to 2, resulting in a decision not to certify the results.  Explaining his vote to certify the results, Chairman Segaloff stated that \xe2\x80\x9cnobody convinced me that we can feel comfortable that, in fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s some likelihood that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an exam designed that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be less discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1159\xe2\x80\x93A1160.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSB\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to certify the examination results led to this lawsuit.

Petitioners also named as a defendant Boise Kimber, a New Haven resident who voiced strong opposition to certifying the results.  Those individuals are respondents in this Court.  Petitioners filed suit under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71979 and 1980, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71983 and 1985, alleging that respondents, by arguing or voting against certifying the results, violated and conspired to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Petitioners also filed timely charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); upon the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s issuing right-to-sue letters, petitioners amended their complaint to assert that the City violated the disparate-treatment prohibition contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.

Respondents asserted they had a good-faith belief that they would have violated the disparate-impact prohibition in Title VII, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k), had they certified the examination results.  It follows, they maintained, that they cannot be held liable under Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provision for attempting to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact bar.  Petitioners countered that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 good-faith belief was not a valid defense to allegations of disparate treatment and unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents.  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 142.  It described petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument as \xe2\x80\x9cboil[ing] down to the assertion that if [respondents] cannot prove that the disparities on the Lieutenant and Captain exams were due to a particular flaw inherent in those exams, then they should have certified the results because there was no other alternative in place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 156.  The District Court concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding the shortcomings in the evidence on existing, effective alternatives, it is not the case that [respondents] <em>must</em> certify a test where they cannot pinpoint its deficiency explaining its disparate impact \xe2\x80\xa6 simply because they have not yet formulated a better selection method.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It also ruled that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cmotivation to avoid making promotions based on a test with a racially disparate impact \xe2\x80\xa6 does not, as a matter of law, constitute discriminatory intent\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII.  <em>Id.</em>, at 160.  The District Court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection claim on the theory that respondents had not acted because of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory animus\xe2\x80\x9d toward petitioners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 162.  It concluded that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 actions were not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on race\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9call applicants took the same test, and the result was the same for all because the test results were discarded and nobody was promoted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 161.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After full briefing and argument by the parties, the Court of Appeals affirmed in a one-paragraph, unpublished summary order; it later withdrew that order, issuing in its place a nearly identical, one-paragraph <em>per curiam </em>opinion adopting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  530 F.\xc2\xa03d 87 (CA2 2008).

Title VII prohibits both intentional discrimination (known as \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate treatment\xe2\x80\x9d) as well as, in some cases, practices that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities (known as \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As enacted in 1964, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s principal nondiscrimination provision held employers liable only for disparate treatment.  That section retains its original wording today.  It makes it unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1); see also 78 Stat. 255.  Disparate-treatment cases present \xe2\x80\x9cthe most easily understood type of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U. S. 324</a>, 335, n. 15 (1977), and occur where an employer has \xe2\x80\x9ctreated [a] particular person less favorably than others because of\xe2\x80\x9d a protected trait.  <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U.

A disparate-treatment plaintiff must establish \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive\xe2\x80\x9d for taking a job-related action.  <em>Id.</em>, at 986.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include an express prohibition on policies or practices that produce a disparate impact.  But in <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a> (1971), the Court interpreted the Act to prohibit, in some cases, employers\xe2\x80\x99 facially neutral practices that, in fact, are \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory in operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 431.  The <em>Griggs</em> Court stated that the \xe2\x80\x9ctouchstone\xe2\x80\x9d for disparate-impact liability is the lack of \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cIf an employment practice which operates to exclude [minorities] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id</em>., at 432 (employer\xe2\x80\x99s burden to demonstrate that practice has \xe2\x80\x9ca manifest relationship to the employment in question\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U. S. 405</a>, 425 (1975).  Under those precedents, if an employer met its burden by showing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was required to show a legitimate alternative that would have resulted in less discrimination.  <em>Ibid.</em> (allowing complaining party to show \xe2\x80\x9cthat other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twenty years after <em>Griggs</em>, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, was enacted.  The Act included a provision codifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimination.  That provision is now in force along with the disparate-treatment section already noted.  Under the disparate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie violation by showing that an employer uses \xe2\x80\x9ca particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A)(i).  An employer may defend against liability by demonstrating that the practice is \xe2\x80\x9cjob related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Even if the employer meets that burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate needs.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners allege that when the CSB refused to certify the captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race of the successful candidates, it discriminated against them in violation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provision.  The City counters that its decision was permissible because the tests \xe2\x80\x9cappear[ed] to violate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 12.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis begins with this premise: The City\xe2\x80\x99s actions would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent some valid defense.  All the evidence demonstrates that the City chose not to certify the examination results because of the statistical disparity based on race\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, how minority candidates had performed when compared to white candidates.  As the District Court put it, the City rejected the test results because \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many whites and not enough minorities would be promoted were the lists to be certified.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 152; see also <em>ibid.</em> (respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cown arguments \xe2\x80\xa6 show that the City\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for advocating non-certification were related to the racial distribution of the results\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without some other justification, this express, race-based decisionmaking violates Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s command that employers cannot take adverse employment actions because of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s race.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court did not adhere to this principle, however.  It held that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cmotivation to avoid making promotions based on a test with a racially disparate impact \xe2\x80\xa6 does not, as a matter of law, constitute discriminatory intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 160.  And the Government makes a similar argument in this Court.  It contends that the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure of Title VII belies any claim that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s intent to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provisions constitutes prohibited discrimination on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11.  But both of those statements turn upon the City\xe2\x80\x99s objective\xe2\x80\x94avoiding disparate-impact liability\xe2\x80\x94while ignoring the City\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the name of reaching that objective.  Whatever the City\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate aim\xe2\x80\x94however well intentioned or benevolent it might have seemed\xe2\x80\x94the City made its employment decision because of race.  The City rejected the test results solely because<em> </em>the higher scoring candidates were white.  The question is not whether that conduct was discriminatory but whether the City had a lawful justification for its race-based action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.  Courts often confront cases in which statutes and principles point in different directions.  Our task is to provide guidance to employers and courts for situations when these two prohibitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.  In providing this guidance our decision must be consistent with the important purpose of Title VII\xe2\x80\x94that the workplace be an environment free of discrimination, where race is not a barrier to opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these principles in mind, we turn to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 proposed means of reconciling the statutory provisions.  Petitioners take a strict approach, arguing that under Title VII, it cannot be permissible for an employer to take race-based adverse employment actions in order to avoid disparate-impact liability\xe2\x80\x94even if the employer knows its practice violates the disparate-impact provision.  See Brief for Petitioners 43.  Petitioners would have us hold that, under Title VII, avoiding unintentional discrimination cannot justify intentional discrimination.  That assertion, however, ignores the fact that, by codifying the disparate-impact provision in 1991, Congress has expressly prohibited both types of discrimination.  We must interpret the statute to give effect to both provisions where possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp.</em>,\n<a href="/cases/federal/us/551/128/index.html">551 U. S. 128</a>, 137 (2007) (rejecting an interpretation\nthat would render a statutory provision \xe2\x80\x9ca dead letter\xe2\x80\x9d).  We cannot accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 broad and inflexible\nformulation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners next suggest that an employer in fact must be in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it can use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment suit.  Again, this is overly simplistic and too restrictive of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  The rule petitioners offer would run counter to what we have recognized as Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent that \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary compliance\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9cthe preferred means of achieving the objectives of Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firefighters</em> v. <em>Cleveland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/501/index.html">478 U. S. 501</a>, 515 (1986); see also <em>Wygant</em> v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 290 (1986) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Forbidding employers to act unless they know, with certainty, that a practice violates the disparate-impact provision would bring compliance efforts to a near<em> </em>standstill.  Even in the limited situations when this restricted standard could be met, employers likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the opposite end of the spectrum, respondents and the Government assert that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith belief that its actions are necessary to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision should be enough to justify race-conscious conduct.  But the original, foundational prohibition of Title VII bars employers from taking adverse action \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 race.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  And when Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in 1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability for actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the new, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k).  Allowing employers to violate the disparate-treatment prohibition based on a mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact liability would encourage race-based action at the slightest hint of disparate impact.  A minimal standard could cause employers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial promotional examinations even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-impact discrimination.  That would amount to a <em>de facto</em> quota system, in which a \xe2\x80\x9cfocus on statistics \xe2\x80\xa6 could put undue pressure on employers to adopt inappropriate prophylactic measures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Watson</em>, 487 U. S., at 992 (plurality opinion).  Even worse, an employer could discard test results (or other employment practices) with the intent of obtaining the employer\xe2\x80\x99s preferred racial balance.  That operational principle could not be justified, for Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of its requirements as calling for outright racial balancing.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(j).  The purpose of Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cis to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griggs</em>, 401 U. S., at 434.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In searching for a standard that strikes a more appropriate balance, we note that this Court has considered cases similar to this one, albeit in the context of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court has held that certain government actions to remedy past racial discrimination\xe2\x80\x94actions that are themselves based on race\xe2\x80\x94are constitutional only where there is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the remedial actions were necessary.  <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 500 (1989) (quoting <em>Wygant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 277 (plurality opinion)).  This suit does not call on us to consider whether the statutory constraints under Title VII must be parallel in all respects to those under the Constitution.  That does not mean the constitutional authorities are irrelevant, however.  Our cases discussing constitutional principles can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context.  See <em>Watson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 993 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Writing for a plurality in <em>Wygant</em> and announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, Justice Powell recognized the tension between eliminating segregation and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other.  476 U. S., at 277.  The plurality stated that those \xe2\x80\x9crelated constitutional duties are not always harmonious,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9creconciling them requires \xe2\x80\xa6 employers to act with extraordinary care.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The plurality required a strong basis in evidence because \xe2\x80\x9c[e]videntiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court applied the same standard in <em>Croson</em>, observing that \xe2\x80\x9can amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota.\xe2\x80\x9d  488 U. S., at 499.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same interests are at work in the interplay between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.  Congress has imposed liability on employers for unintentional discrimination in order to rid the workplace of \xe2\x80\x9cpractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griggs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 431.  But it has also prohibited employers from taking adverse employment actions \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d race.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  Applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.  The standard leaves ample room for employers\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary compliance efforts, which are essential to the statutory scheme and to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to eradicate workplace discrimination.  See <em>Firefighters</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 515.  And the standard appropriately constrains employers\xe2\x80\x99 discretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that discretion to cases in which there is a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so restrictive that it allows employers to act only when there is a provable, actual violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resolving the statutory conflict in this way allows the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores on the basis of race.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>).  Examinations like those administered by the City create legitimate expectations on the part of those who took the tests.  As is the case with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters here invested substantial time, money, and personal commitment in preparing for the tests.  Employment tests can be an important part of a neutral selection system that safeguards against the very racial animosities Title VII was intended to prevent.  Here, however, the firefighters saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reliance upon race-based statistics.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 race, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>), then it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that it may not take the greater step of discarding the test altogether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of promotion-eligible candidates\xe2\x80\x94absent a strong basis in evidence that the test was deficient and that discarding the results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate-impact provision.  Restricting an employer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to discard test results (and thereby discriminate against qualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in keeping with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s express protection of bona fide promotional examinations.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(h) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]or shall it be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em> v. <em>Hulteen</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our statutory holding does not address the constitutionality of the measures taken here in purported compliance with Title VII.  We also do not hold that meeting the strong-basis-in-evidence standard would satisfy the Equal Protection Clause in a future case.  As we explain below, because respondents have not met their burden under Title VII, we need not decide whether a legitimate fear of disparate impact is ever sufficient to justify discriminatory treatment under the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we question an employer\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative efforts to ensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for promotions and to participate in the process by which promotions will be made.  But once that process has been established and employers have made clear their selection criteria, they may not then invalidate the test results, thus upsetting an employee\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate expectation not to be judged on the basis of race.  Doing so, absent a strong basis in evidence of an impermissible disparate impact, amounts to the sort of racial preference that Congress has disclaimed, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(j), and is antithetical to the notion of a workplace where individuals are guaranteed equal opportunity regardless of race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title VII does not prohibit an employer from considering, before administering a test or practice, how to design that test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity for all individuals, regardless of their race.  And when, during the test-design stage, an employer invites comments to ensure the test is fair, that process can provide a common ground for open discussions toward that end.  We hold only that, under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, its decision to discard the examination results was permissible under Title VII.  That is incorrect.  Even if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for the conclusion that respondents had an objective, strong basis in evidence to find the tests inadequate, with some consequent disparate-impact liability in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this basis, we conclude that petitioners have met their obligation to demonstrate that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno genuine issue as to any material fact\xe2\x80\x9d and that they are \xe2\x80\x9centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).  On a motion for summary judgment, \xe2\x80\x9cfacts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a \xe2\x80\x98genuine\xe2\x80\x99 dispute as to those facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 380 (2007).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matsushita Elec.

In this Court, the City\xe2\x80\x99s only defense is that it acted to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision.  To succeed on their motion, then, petitioners must demonstrate that there can be no genuine dispute that there was no strong basis in evidence for the City to conclude it would face disparate-impact liability if it certified the examination results.  See <em>Celotex Corp.</em> v. <em>Catrett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/317/index.html">477 U. S. 317</a>, 324 (1986) (where the nonmoving party \xe2\x80\x9cwill bear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue,\xe2\x80\x9d the nonmoving party bears the burden of production under Rule 56 to \xe2\x80\x9cdesignate specific facts showing that there is\na genuine issue for trial\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The racial adverse impact here was significant, and petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability.  On the captain exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 64 percent but was 37.5 percent for both black and Hispanic candidates.  On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 58.1 percent; for black candidates, 31.6 percent; and for Hispanic candidates, 20 percent.  The pass rates of minorities, which were approximately one-half the pass rates for white candidates, fall well below the 80-percent standard set by the EEOC to implement the disparate-impact provision of Title VII.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71607.4(D) (2008) (selection rate that is less than 80 percent \xe2\x80\x9cof the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Watson</em>, 487 U. S., at 995\xe2\x80\x93996, n. 3 (plurality opinion) (EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s 80-percent standard is \xe2\x80\x9ca rule of thumb for the courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Based on how the passing candidates ranked and an application of the \xe2\x80\x9crule of three,\xe2\x80\x9d certifying the examinations would have meant that the City could not have considered black candidates for any of the then-vacant lieutenant or captain positions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the degree of adverse impact reflected in the results, respondents were compelled to take a hard look at the examinations to determine whether certifying the results would have had an impermissible disparate impact.  The problem for respondents is that a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability\xe2\x80\x94essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, <em>Connecticut</em> v. <em>Teal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/440/index.html">457 U. S. 440</a>, 446 (1982), and nothing more\xe2\x80\x94is far from a strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the results.  That is because the City could be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were not job related and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alternative that served the City\xe2\x80\x99s needs but that the City refused to adopt.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k)(1)(A), (C).  We conclude there is no strong basis in evidence to establish that the test was deficient in either of these respects.  We address each of the two points in turn, based on the record developed by the parties through discovery\xe2\x80\x94a record that concentrates in substantial part on the statements various witnesses made to the CSB.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no genuine dispute that the examinations were job-related and consistent with business necessity.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s assertions to the contrary are \xe2\x80\x9cblatantly contradicted by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 380.  The CSB heard statements from Chad Legel (the IOS vice president) as well as city officials outlining the detailed steps IOS took to develop and administer the examinations.  IOS devised the written examinations, which were the focus of the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry, after painstaking analyses of the captain and lieutenant positions\xe2\x80\x94analyses in which IOS made sure that minorities were overrepresented.  And IOS drew the questions from source material approved by the Department.  Of the outside witnesses who appeared before the CSB, only one, Vincent Lewis, had reviewed the examinations in any detail, and he was the only one with any firefighting experience.  Lewis stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cquestions were relevant for both exams.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A1053.  The only other witness who had seen any part of the examinations, Christopher Hornick (a competitor of IOS\xe2\x80\x99s), criticized the fact that no one within the Department had reviewed the tests\xe2\x80\x94a condition imposed by the City to protect the integrity of the exams in light of past alleged security breaches.  But Hornick stated that the exams \xe2\x80\x9cappea[r] to be .\xc2\xa0. reasonably good\xe2\x80\x9d and recommended that the CSB certify the results.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1041.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arguing that the examinations were not job-related, respondents note some candidates\xe2\x80\x99 complaints that certain examination questions were contradictory or did not specifically apply to firefighting practices in New Haven.  But Legel told the CSB that IOS had addressed those concerns\xe2\x80\x94that it entertained \xe2\x80\x9ca handful\xe2\x80\x9d of challenges to the validity of particular examination questions, that it \xe2\x80\x9creviewed those challenges and provided feedback [to the City] as to what we thought the best course of action was,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he could remember at least one question IOS had thrown out (\xe2\x80\x9coffer[ing] credit to everybody for that particular question\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Id.</em>, at A955\xe2\x80\x93A957.  For his part, Hornick said he \xe2\x80\x9csuspect[ed] that some of the criticisms \xe2\x80\xa6 [leveled] by candidates\xe2\x80\x9d were not valid.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1035.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City, moreover, turned a blind eye to evidence that supported the exams\xe2\x80\x99 validity.  Although the City\xe2\x80\x99s contract with IOS contemplated that IOS would prepare a technical report consistent with EEOC guidelines for examination-validity studies, the City made no request for its report.  After the January 2004 meeting between Legel and some of the city-official respondents, in which Legel defended the examinations, the City sought no further information from IOS, save its appearance at a CSB meeting to explain how it developed and administered the examinations.  IOS stood ready to provide respondents with detailed information to establish the validity of the exams, but respondents did not accept that offer.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also lacked a strong basis in evidence of an equally valid, less-discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by certifying the examination results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.  Respondents raise three arguments to the contrary, but each argument fails.  First, respondents refer to testimony before the CSB that a different composite-score calculation\xe2\x80\x94weighting the written and oral examination scores 30/70\xe2\x80\x94would have allowed the City to consider two black candidates for then-open lieutenant positions and one black candidate for then-open captain positions.  (The City used a 60/40 weighting as required by its contract with the New Haven firefighters\xe2\x80\x99 union.)  But respondents have produced no evidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed arbitrary.  In fact, because that formula was the result of a union-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we presume the parties negotiated that weighting for a rational reason.  Nor does the record contain any evidence that the 30/70 weighting would be an equally valid way to determine whether candidates possess the proper mix of job knowledge and situational skills to earn promotions.  Changing the weighting formula, moreover, could well have violated Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of altering test scores on the basis of race.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>).  On this record, there is no basis to conclude that a 30/70 weighting was an equally valid alternative the City could have adopted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, respondents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9crule of three\xe2\x80\x9d that would have produced less discriminatory results.  The rule, in the New Haven city charter, requires the City to promote only from \xe2\x80\x9cthose applicants with the three highest scores\xe2\x80\x9d on a promotional examination.  New Haven, Conn., Code of Ordinances, Tit. I, Art. XXX, \xc2\xa7160 (1992).  A state court has interpreted the charter to prohibit so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbanding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the City\xe2\x80\x99s previous practice of rounding scores to the nearest whole number and considering all candidates with the same whole-number score as being of one rank.  Banding allowed the City to consider three ranks of candidates (with the possibility of multiple candidates filling each rank) for purposes of the rule of three.  See <em>Kelly</em> v. <em>New Haven</em>, No. CV000444614, 2004 WL 114377, *3 (Conn. Super. Ct., Jan. 9, 2004).  Respondents claim that employing banding here would have made four black and one Hispanic candidates eligible for then-open lieutenant and captain positions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A state court\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of banding, as a matter of municipal law under the charter, may not eliminate banding as a valid alternative under Title VII.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x937.  We need not resolve that point, however.  Here, banding was not a valid alternative for this reason: Had the City reviewed the exam results and then adopted banding to make the minority test scores appear higher, it would have violated Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of adjusting test results on the basis of race.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(<em>l</em>); see also <em>Chicago Firefighters Local 2</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 249 F.\xc2\xa03d 649, 656 (CA7 2001) (Posner, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no doubt that if banding were adopted in order to make lower black scores seem higher, it would indeed be \xe2\x80\xa6 forbidden\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a matter of law, banding was not an alternative available to the City when it was considering whether to certify the examination results.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by Hornick in his telephone interview with the CSB regarding alternatives to the written examinations.  Hornick stated his \xe2\x80\x9cbelie[f]\xe2\x80\x9d that an \xe2\x80\x9cassessment center process,\xe2\x80\x9d which would have evaluated candidates\xe2\x80\x99 behavior in typical job tasks, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have demonstrated less adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A1039.  But Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s brief mention of alternative testing methods, standing alone, does not raise a genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers were available to the City at the time of the examinations and that they would have produced less adverse impact.  Other statements to the CSB indicated that the Department could not have used assessment centers for the 2003 examinations. <em> Supra,</em> at 14.  And although respondents later argued to the CSB that Hornick had pushed the City to reject the test results, <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317, the truth is that the essence of Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s remarks supported its certifying the test results.  See <em>Scott</em>, 550 U. S., at 380.  Hornick stated that adverse impact in standardized testing \xe2\x80\x9chas been in existence since the beginning of testing,\xe2\x80\x9d CA2 App. A1037, and that the disparity in New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s test results was \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat higher but generally in the range that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen professionally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1030\xe2\x80\x93A1031.  He told the CSB he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot suggesting\xe2\x80\x9d that IOS \xe2\x80\x9csomehow created a test that had adverse impacts that it should not have had.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1038.  And he suggested that the CSB should \xe2\x80\x9ccertify the list as it exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1041.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard applies, respondents cannot create a genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) statements in the record.  And there is no doubt respondents fall short of the mark by relying entirely on isolated statements by Hornick.  Hornick had not \xe2\x80\x9cstud[ied] the test at length or in detail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1030.  And as he told the CSB, he is a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect competitor\xe2\x80\x9d of IOS\xe2\x80\x99s.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1029.  The remainder of his remarks showed that Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s primary concern\xe2\x80\x94somewhat to the frustration of CSB members\xe2\x80\x94was marketing his services for the future, not commenting on the results of the tests the City had already administered.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at A1026, A1027, A1032, A1036, A1040, A1041.  Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s hinting had its intended effect: The City has since hired him as a consultant.  As for the other outside witnesses who spoke to the CSB, Vincent Lewis (the retired fire captain) thought the CSB should certify the test results.  And Janet Helms (the Boston College professor) declined to review the examinations and told the CSB that, as a society, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to develop a new way of assessing people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A1073.  That task was beyond the reach of the CSB, which was concerned with the adequacy of the test results before it.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that the City lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it would face disparate-impact liability if it certified the examination results.  In other words, there is no evidence\n\xe2\x80\x94let alone the required strong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x94that the tests were flawed because they were not job-related or because other, equally valid and less discriminatory tests were available to the City.  Fear of litigation alone cannot justify an employer\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s discarding the test results was impermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment claim.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record in this litigation documents a process that, at the outset, had the potential to produce a testing procedure that was true to the promise of Title VII:  No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race.  Respondents thought about promotion qualifications and relevant experience in neutral ways.  They were careful to ensure broad racial participation in the design of the test itself and its administration.  As we have discussed at length, the process was open and fair.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem, of course, is that after the tests were completed, the raw racial results became the predominant rationale for the City\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to certify the results.  The injury arises in part from the high, and justified, expectations of the candidates who had participated in the testing process on the terms the City had established for the promotional process.  Many of the candidates had studied for months, at considerable personal and financial expense, and thus the injury caused by the City\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on raw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the more severe.  Confronted with arguments both for and against certifying the test results\xe2\x80\x94and threats of a lawsuit either way\xe2\x80\x94the City was required to make a difficult inquiry.  But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a disparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled to disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity in the results.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to resolve competing expectations under the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions.  If, after it certifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of our holding today it should be clear that the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based on the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are entitled to summary judgment on their Title VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the underlying constitutional question.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962990">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nRICCI V.

The question is not an easy one.  See generally Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate Impact: Round Three, 117 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 493 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulty is this: Whether or not Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provisions forbid \xe2\x80\x9cremedial\xe2\x80\x9d race-based actions when a disparate-impact violation would <em>not</em> otherwise result\xe2\x80\x94the question resolved by the Court today\xe2\x80\x94it is clear that Title VII not only permits but affirmatively <em>requires</em> such actions when a disparate-impact violation <em>would</em> otherwise result.  See <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  But if the Federal Government is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, <em>Bolling</em> v. <em>Sharpe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/497/index.html">347 U. S. 497</a>, 500 (1954), then surely it is also prohibited from enacting laws mandating that third parties\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, employers, whether private, State, or municipal\xe2\x80\x94discriminate on the basis of race.  See <em>Buchanan</em> v. <em>Warley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/245/60/index.html">245 U. S. 60</a>, 78\xe2\x80\x9382 (1917).  As the facts of these cases illustrate, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provisions place a racial thumb on the scales, often requiring employers to evaluate the racial outcomes of their policies, and to make decisions based on (because of) those racial outcomes.  That type of racial decisionmaking is, as the Court explains, discriminatory.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19; <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U. S. 256</a>, 279 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the disparate-impact laws do not mandate imposition of quotas, but it is not clear why that should provide a safe harbor.  Would a private employer not be guilty of unlawful discrimination if he refrained from establishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally designed his hiring practices to achieve the same end?  Surely he would.  Intentional discrimination is still occurring, just one step up the chain.  Government compulsion of such design would therefore seemingly violate equal protection principles.  Nor would it matter that Title VII requires consideration of race on a wholesale, rather than retail, level.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 911 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And of course the purportedly benign motive for the disparate-impact provisions cannot save the statute.  See <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 227 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It might be possible to defend the law by framing it as simply an evidentiary tool used to identify genuine, intentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9csmoke out,\xe2\x80\x9d as it were, disparate treatment.  See Primus, <em>supra</em>, at 498\xe2\x80\x93499, 520\xe2\x80\x93521.  Disparate impact is sometimes (though not always, see <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U. S. 977</a>, 992 (1988) (plurality opinion)) a signal of something illicit, so a regulator might allow statistical disparities to play some role in the evidentiary process.  Cf. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a>, 802\xe2\x80\x93803 (1973).  But arguably the disparate-impact provisions sweep too broadly to be fairly characterized in such a fashion\xe2\x80\x94since they fail to provide an affirmative defense for good-faith (<em>i.e.</em>, nonracially motivated) conduct, or perhaps even for good faith plus hiring standards that are entirely reasonable.  See <em>post</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, and n.\xc2\xa01 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (describing the demanding nature of the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d defense).  This is a question that this Court will have to consider in due course.  It is one thing to free plaintiffs from proving an employer\xe2\x80\x99s illicit intent, but quite another to preclude the employer from proving that its motives were pure and its actions reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of these cases makes it unnecessary to resolve these matters today.  But the war between disparate impact and equal protection will be waged sooner or later, and it behooves us to begin thinking about how\xe2\x80\x94and on what terms\xe2\x80\x94to make peace between them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962989">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nRICCI V.

I write separately only because the dissent, while claiming that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the facts leaves out important parts of the story,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 2 (opinion of Ginsburg,\xc2\xa0J.), provides an incomplete description of the events that led to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reject the results of its exam.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s omissions are important because, when all of the evidence in the record is taken into account, it is clear that, even if the legal analysis in Parts II and III\xe2\x80\x93A of the dissent were accepted, affirmance of the decision below is untenable.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When an employer in a disparate-treatment case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 claims that an employment decision, such as the refusal to promote, was based on a legitimate reason, two questions\xe2\x80\x94one objective and one subjective\xe2\x80\x94must be decided.  The first, objective question is whether the reason given by the employer is one that is legitimate under Title VII.  See <em>St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Center</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/502/index.html">509 U. S. 502</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93507 (1993).  If the reason provided by the employer is not legitimate on its face, the employer is liable.  <em>Id.</em>, at 509.  The second, subjective question concerns the employer\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  If an employer offers a facially legitimate reason for its decision but it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext for discrimination, the employer is again liable.  See <em>id.</em>, at 510\xe2\x80\x93512.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question on which the opinion of the Court and the dissenting opinion disagree concerns the objective component of the determination that must be made when an employer justifies an employment decision, like the one made in this litigation, on the ground that a contrary decision would have created a risk of disparate-impact liability.  The Court holds\xe2\x80\x94and I entirely agree\xe2\x80\x94that concern about disparate-impact liability is a legitimate reason for a decision of the type involved here only if there was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial basis in evidence to find the tests inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  The Court ably demonstrates that in this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city of New Haven (City) possessed such evidence and therefore summary judgment for petitioners is required.  Because the Court correctly holds that respondents cannot satisfy this objective component, the Court has no need to discuss the question of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 actual intent.  As the Court puts it, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for the conclusion that respondents had an objective, substantial basis in evidence to find the tests inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent advocates a different objective component of the governing standard.  According to the dissent, the objective component should be whether the evidence provided \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause\xe2\x80\x9d for the decision, <em>post</em>, at 19, and the dissent argues\xe2\x80\x94incorrectly, in my view\xe2\x80\x94that no reasonable juror could fail to find that such evidence was present here.  But even if the dissent were correct on this point, I assume that the dissent would not countenance summary judgment for respondents if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 professed concern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a pretext.  Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the entry of summary judgment for respondents, cannot be affirmed unless no reasonable jury could find that the City\xe2\x80\x99s asserted reason for scrapping its test\xe2\x80\x94concern about disparate-impact liability\xe2\x80\x94was a pretext and that the City\xe2\x80\x99s real reason was illegitimate, namely, the desire to placate a politically important racial constituency.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As initially described by the dissent, see <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x9312, the process by which the City reached the decision not to accept the test results was open, honest, serious, and deliberative.  But even the District Court admitted that \xe2\x80\x9ca jury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because they knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the wrath of [Rev.

In 1996, for example, Mayor DeStefano testified for Rev. Kimber as a character witness when Rev. Kimber\xe2\x80\x94then the manager of a funeral home\xe2\x80\x94was prosecuted and convicted for stealing prepaid funeral expenses from an elderly woman and then lying about the matter under oath.  See <em>id.</em>, at 126a, 907a.  \xe2\x80\x9cReverend Kimber has played a leadership role in all of Mayor DeStefano\xe2\x80\x99s political campaigns, [and] is considered a valuable political supporter and vote-getter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 126a.  According to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s former campaign manager (who is currently his  executive assistant), Rev. Kimber is an invaluable political asset because \xe2\x80\x9c[h]e\xe2\x80\x99s very good at organizing people and putting together field operations, as a result of his ties to labor, his prominence in the religious community and his long-standing commitment to roots.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 908a (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, the Mayor picked Rev.

As discussed in further detail below, Rev.

Burgett wanted to clarify that the City\xe2\x80\x99s executive officials would meet \xe2\x80\x9csans the Chief, and that once we had a better fix on the next steps we would meet with the Mayor (possibly) and then the two Chiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 446a.  The \xe2\x80\x9ctwo Chiefs\xe2\x80\x9d are Fire Chief William Grant (who is white) and Assistant Fire Chief Ronald Dumas (who is African-American).  Both chiefs believed that the test results should be certified.  <em>Id.</em>, at 228a, 817a.  Petitioners allege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his staff colluded \xe2\x80\x9csans the Chief[s]\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendants did not want Grant\xe2\x80\x99s or Dumas\xe2\x80\x99 views to be publicly known; accordingly both men were prevented by the Mayor and his staff from making any statements regarding the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 228a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next day, on January 13, 2004, Chad Legel, who had designed the tests, flew from Chicago to New Haven to meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude, the City\xe2\x80\x99s corporate counsel.  <em>Id.</em>, at 179a.  \xe2\x80\x9cLegel outlined the merits of the examination and why city officials should be confident in the validity of the results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But according to Legel, Dubois-Walton was \xe2\x80\x9cargumentative\xe2\x80\x9d and apparently had already made up her mind that the tests were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 179a\xe2\x80\x93180a.  Again according to Legel, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] theme\xe2\x80\x9d of the meeting was \xe2\x80\x9cthe political and racial overtones of what was going on in the City.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 181a.  \xe2\x80\x9cLegel came away from the January 13, 2004 meeting with the impression that defendants were already leaning toward discarding the examination results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 180a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board (CSB or Board) convened its first public meeting.  Almost immediately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the CSB.  He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that required the CSB Chairman to shout him down and hold him out of order three times.  See <em>id.</em>, at 187a, 467a\xe2\x80\x93468a; see also App. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x934996\xe2\x80\x93cv (CA2), pp. A703\xe2\x80\x93A705.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 129a\xe2\x80\x93130a, 816a\xe2\x80\x93817a.

Tinney alleged that the white firefighters had cheated on their exams\xe2\x80\x94an accusation that Dubois-Walton conveyed to the Board without first conducting an investigation into its veracity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 837a\xe2\x80\x93838a; see also App. 164 (statement of CSB Chairman, noting the allegations of cheating).  The allegation turned out to be baseless.

In accordance with directions from the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office to make the CSB meetings appear deliberative, see <em>id.</em>, at 190a, executive officials remained publicly uncommitted about certification\xe2\x80\x94while simultaneously \xe2\x80\x9cwork[ing] as a team\xe2\x80\x9d behind closed doors with the secretary of the CSB to devise a political message that would convince the CSB to vote against certification, see <em>id.</em>, at 447a.  At the public CSB meeting on March 11, 2004, for example, Corporation Counsel Ude bristled at one board member\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that City officials were recommending against certifying the test results.  See <em>id.</em>, at 215a (\xe2\x80\x9cAttorney Ude took offense, stating, \xe2\x80\x98Frankly, because I would never make a recommendation\xe2\x80\x94I would not have made a recommendation like that\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But within days of making that public statement, Ude privately told other members of the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s team \xe2\x80\x9cthe ONLY way we get to a decision not to certify is\xe2\x80\x9d to focus on something other than \xe2\x80\x9ca big discussion re: adverse impact\xe2\x80\x9d law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 458a\xe2\x80\x93459a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As part of its effort to deflect attention from the specifics of the test, the City relied heavily on the testimony of Dr. Christopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel\xe2\x80\x99s competitors in the test-development business.  Hornick never \xe2\x80\x9cstud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in detail,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 549a; see also <em>id.</em>, at 203a, 553a, but Hornick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by Burgett to criticize Legel\xe2\x80\x99s test.  For example, Hornick \xe2\x80\x9cnoted in the literature that [Burgett] sent that the test was not customized to the New Haven Fire Department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 551a.  The Chairman of the CSB immediately corrected Hornick.  <em>Id.</em>, at 552a (\xe2\x80\x9cActually, it was, Dr. Hornick\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hornick also relied on newspaper accounts\xe2\x80\x94again, sent to him by Burgett\xe2\x80\x94pertaining to the controversy surrounding the certification decision.  See <em>id.</em>, at 204a, 557a.  Although Hornick again admitted that he had no knowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed and that the City had administered, see <em>id.</em>, at 560a\xe2\x80\x93561a, the City repeatedly relied upon Hornick as a testing \xe2\x80\x9cguru\xe2\x80\x9d and, in the CSB Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe City ke[pt] quoting him as a person that we should rely upon more than anybody else [to conclude that there] is a better way\xe2\x80\x94a better mousetrap.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  App. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x934996\xe2\x80\x93cv (CA2), at A1128.

Accordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton sent an e-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s executive assistant, Burgett, and attorney Ude, attaching two alternative press releases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 457a.  The first would be issued if the CSB voted not to certify the test results; the second would be issued (and would explain the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of his executive authority) if the CSB voted to certify the test results.  <em>Id.</em>, at 217a\xe2\x80\x93218a, 590a\xe2\x80\x93591a, 819a\xe2\x80\x93820a.  Half an hour after Dubois-Walton circulated the alternative drafts, Burgett replied: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]ell, that seems to say it all.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope draft #2 hits the shredder tomorrow nite.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 457a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soon after the CSB voted against certification, Mayor DeStefano appeared at a dinner event and \xe2\x80\x9ctook credit for the scu[tt]ling of the examination results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 230a.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking into account all the evidence in the summary judgment record, a reasonable jury could find the following.  Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial makeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on the exam, the City administration was lobbied by an influential community leader to scrap the test results, and the City administration decided on that course of action before making any real assessment of the possibility of a disparate-impact violation.  To achieve that end, the City administration concealed its internal decision but worked\xe2\x80\x94as things turned out, successfully\xe2\x80\x94to persuade the CSB that acceptance of the test results would be illegal and would expose the City to disparate-impact liability.  But in the event that the CSB was not persuaded, the Mayor, wielding ultimate decisionmaking authority, was prepared to overrule the CSB immediately.  Taking this view of the evidence, a reasonable jury could easily find that the City\xe2\x80\x99s real reason for scrapping the test results was not a concern about violating the disparate-impact provision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politically important racial constituency.  It is noteworthy that the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x94whose position on the principal legal issue in this case is largely aligned with the dissent\xe2\x80\x94concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]either the district court nor the court of appeals \xe2\x80\xa6 adequately considered whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners, a genuine issue of material fact remained whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a pretext for intentional racial discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus</em> <em>Curiae</em> 6; see also <em>id., </em>at<em> </em>32\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I will not comment at length on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of my analysis, but two points require a response.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first concerns the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s statement that I \xe2\x80\x9cequat[e] political considerations with unlawful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 36.  The dissent misrepresents my position: I draw no such equation.  Of course \xe2\x80\x9cthere are many ways in which a politician can attempt to win over a constituency\xe2\x80\x94including a racial constituency\xe2\x80\x94without engaging in unlawful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  But\xe2\x80\x94as I assume the dissent would agree\xe2\x80\x94there are some things that a public official cannot do, and one of those is engaging in intentional racial discrimination when making employment decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second point concerns the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s main argument\xe2\x80\x94that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle the test results are irrelevant because the ultimate decision was made by the CSB.  According to the dissent, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he relevant decision was made by the CSB,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 34, and there is \xe2\x80\x9cscant cause to suspect\xe2\x80\x9d that anything done by the opponents of certification, including the Mayor and his staff, \xe2\x80\x9cprevented the CSB from evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams and rendering an independent, good-faith decision on certification,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 36.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adoption of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument would implicitly decide an important question of Title VII law that this Court has never resolved\xe2\x80\x94the circumstances in which an employer may be held liable based on the discriminatory intent of subordinate employees who influence but do not make the ultimate employment decision.  There is a large body of court of appeals case law on this issue, and these cases disagree about the proper standard.  See <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles</em>, 450 F.\xc2\xa03d 476, 484\xe2\x80\x93488 (CA10 2006) (citing cases and describing the approaches taken in different Circuits).  One standard is whether the subordinate \xe2\x80\x9cexerted influenc[e] over the titular decisionmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russell </em>v.<em> McKinney Hosp. Venture</em>, 235 F.\xc2\xa03d 219, 227 (CA5 2000); see also <em>Poland</em> v. <em>Chertoff</em>, 494 F.\xc2\xa03d 1174, 1182 (CA9 2007) (A subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s bias is imputed to the employer where the subordinate \xe2\x80\x9cinfluenced or was involved in the decision or decisionmaking process\xe2\x80\x9d).  Another is whether the discriminatory input \xe2\x80\x9ccaused the adverse employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles</em>,<em> supra</em>,<em> </em>at 487.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present cases, a reasonable jury could certainly find that these standards were met.  The dissent makes much of the fact that members of the CSB swore under oath that their votes were based on the good-faith belief that certification of the results would have violated federal law.  See <em>post</em>, at 34.  But the good faith of the CSB members would not preclude a finding that the presentations engineered by the Mayor and his staff influenced or caused the CSB decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The least employee-friendly standard asks only whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x9d acted with discriminatory intent, see <em>Hill </em>v.<em> Lockheed Martin Logistics Management, Inc</em>., 354 F.\xc2\xa03d 277, 291 (CA4 2004) (en banc), and it is telling that, even under this standard, summary judgment for respondents would not be proper.  This is so because a reasonable jury could certainly find that in New Haven, the Mayor\xe2\x80\x94not the CSB\xe2\x80\x94wielded the final decisionmaking power.  After all, the Mayor claimed that authority and was poised to use it in the event that the CSB decided to accept the test results.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9.  If the Mayor had the authority to overrule a CSB decision <em>accepting</em> the test results, the Mayor also presumably had the authority to overrule the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s decision <em>rejecting</em> the test results.  In light of the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, it would be quite wrong to throw out petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 case on the ground that the CSB was the ultimate decisionmaker.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are firefighters who seek only a fair chance to move up the ranks in their chosen profession.

S. 306</a>, 327 (2003).  In 1972, Congress extended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover public employment.  At that time, municipal fire departments across the country, including New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s, pervasively discriminated against minorities.  The extension of Title VII to cover jobs in firefighting effected no overnight change.  It took decades of persistent effort, advanced by Title VII litigation, to open firefighting posts to members of racial minorities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The white firefighters who scored high on New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s promotional exams understandably attract this Court\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy.  But they had no vested right to promotion.  Nor have other persons received promotions in preference to them.  New Haven maintains that it refused to certify the test results because it believed, for good cause, that it would be vulnerable to a Title VII disparate-impact suit if it relied on those results.  The Court today holds that New Haven has not demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9ca strong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d for its plea.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  In so holding, the Court pretends that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he City rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  That pretension, essential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, ignores substantial evidence of multiple flaws in the tests New Haven used.  The Court similarly fails to acknowledge the better tests used in other cities, which have yielded less racially skewed outcomes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By order of this Court, New Haven, a city in which African-Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60 percent of the population, must today be served\xe2\x80\x94as it was in the days of undisguised discrimination\xe2\x80\x94by a fire department in which members of racial and ethnic minorities are rarely seen in command positions.  In arriving at its order, the Court barely acknowledges the pathmarking decision in <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/424/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a> (1971), which explained the centrality of the disparate-impact concept to effective enforcement of Title VII.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s order and opinion, I anticipate, will not have staying power.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the facts leaves out important parts of the story.  Firefighting is a profession in which the legacy of racial discrimination casts an especially long shadow.  In extending Title VII to state and local government employers in 1972, Congress took note of a U. S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) report finding racial discrimination in municipal employment even \xe2\x80\x9cmore pervasive than in the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x93238, p. 17 (1971).  According to the report, overt racism was partly to blame, but so too was a failure on the part of municipal employers to apply merit-based employment principles.  In making hiring and promotion decisions, public employers often \xe2\x80\x9crel[ied] on criteria unrelated to job performance,\xe2\x80\x9d including nepotism or political patronage.  118 Cong. Rec. 1817 (1972).  Such flawed selection methods served to entrench preexisting racial hierarchies.  The USCCR report singled out police and fire departments for having \xe2\x80\x9c[b]arriers to equal employment \xe2\x80\xa6 greater \xe2\x80\xa6 than in any other area of State or local government,\xe2\x80\x9d with African-Americans \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing] almost no positions in the officer ranks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  See also National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, America Burning 5 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cRacial minorities are under-represented in the fire departments in nearly every community in which they live.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city of New Haven (City) was no exception.  In the early 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, African-Americans and Hispanics composed 30 percent of New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s population, but only 3.6 percent of the City\xe2\x80\x99s 502 firefighters.  The racial disparity in the officer ranks was even more pronounced: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]f the 107 officers in the Department only one was black, and he held the lowest rank above private.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firebird Soc. of New Haven, Inc.</em> v. <em>New Haven Bd. of Fire Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs</em>, 66 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 457, 460 (Conn. 1975).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following a lawsuit and settlement agreement, see <em>ibid.</em>, the City initiated efforts to increase minority representation in the New Haven Fire Department (Department).  Those litigation-induced efforts produced some positive change.  New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s population includes a greater proportion of minorities today than it did in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s: Nearly 40 percent of the City\xe2\x80\x99s residents are African-American and more than 20 percent are Hispanic.  Among entry-level firefighters, minorities are still underrepresented, but not starkly so.  As of 2003, African-Americans and Hispanics constituted 30 percent and 16 percent of the City\xe2\x80\x99s firefighters, respectively.  In supervisory positions, however, significant disparities remain.  Overall, the senior officer ranks (captain and higher) are nine percent African-American and nine percent Hispanic.  Only one of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s 21 fire captains is African-American.  See App. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x934996\xe2\x80\x93cv (CA2), p. A1588 (hereinafter CA2 App.).  It is against this backdrop of entrenched inequality that the promotion process at issue in this litigation should be assessed.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By order of its charter, New Haven must use competitive examinations to fill vacancies in fire officer and other civil-service positions.  Such examinations, the City\xe2\x80\x99s civil service rules specify, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be practical in nature, shall relate to matters which fairly measure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties of the position which they seek, and shall take into account character, training, experience, physical and mental fitness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at A331.  The City may choose among a variety of testing methods, including written and oral exams and \xe2\x80\x9c[p]erformance tests to demonstrate skill and ability in performing actual work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A332.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New Haven, the record indicates, did not closely consider what sort of \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d examination would \xe2\x80\x9cfairly measure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties\xe2\x80\x9d of a fire officer.  Instead, the City simply adhered to the testing regime outlined in its two-decades-old contract with the local firefighters\xe2\x80\x99 union: a written exam, which would account for 60 percent of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s total score, and an oral exam, which would account for the remaining 40 percent.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1045.  In soliciting bids from exam development companies, New Haven made clear that it would entertain only \xe2\x80\x9cproposals that include a written component that will be weighted at 60%, and an oral component that will be weighted at 40%.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A342.  Chad Legel, a representative of the winning bidder, Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS), testified during his deposition that the City never asked whether alternative methods might better measure the qualities of a successful fire officer, including leadership skills and command presence.  See <em>id.,</em> at A522 (\xe2\x80\x9cI was under contract and had responsibility only to create the oral interview and the written exam.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s specifications, IOS developed and administered the oral and written exams.  The results showed significant racial disparities.  On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for African-American candidates was about one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates; the pass rate for Hispanic candidates was even lower.  On the captain exam, both African-American and Hispanic candidates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian counterparts.  See App. 225\xe2\x80\x93226.  More striking still, although nearly half of the 77 lieutenant candidates were African-American or Hispanic, none would have been eligible for promotion to the eight positions then vacant.  The highest scoring African-American candidate ranked 13th; the top Hispanic candidate was 26th.  As for the seven then-vacant captain positions, two Hispanic candidates would have been eligible, but no African-Americans.  The highest scoring African-American candidate ranked 15th.  See <em>id.,</em> at 218\xe2\x80\x93219.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These stark disparities, the Court acknowledges, sufficed to state a prima facie case under Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision.  See <em>ante</em>, at 27 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe pass rates of minorities . . . f[e]ll well below the 80-percent standard set by the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)] to implement the disparate-impact provision of Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d).  New Haven thus had cause for concern about the prospect of Title VII litigation and liability.  City officials referred the matter to the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB), the entity responsible for certifying the results of employment exams.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between January and March 2004, the CSB held five public meetings to consider the proper course.  At the first meeting, New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s Corporation Counsel, Thomas Ude, described the legal standard governing Title VII disparate-impact claims.  Statistical imbalances alone, Ude correctly recognized, do not give rise to liability.  Instead, presented with a disparity, an employer \xe2\x80\x9chas the opportunity and the burden of proving that the test is job-related and consistent with business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A724.  A Title VII plaintiff may attempt to rebut an employer\xe2\x80\x99s showing of job-relatedness and necessity by identifying alternative selection methods that would have been at least as valid but with \xe2\x80\x9cless of an adverse or disparate or discriminatory effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  See also <em>id</em>., at A738.  Accordingly, the CSB Commissioners understood, their principal task was to decide whether they were confident about the reliability of the exams: Had the exams fairly measured the qualities of a successful fire officer despite their disparate results?  Might an alternative examination process have identified the most qualified candidates without creating such significant racial imbalances?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seeking a range of input on these questions, the CSB heard from test takers, the test designer, subject-matter experts, City officials, union leaders, and community members.  Several candidates for promotion, who did not yet know their exam results, spoke at the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s first two meetings.  Some candidates favored certification.  The exams, they emphasized, had closely tracked the assigned study materials.  Having invested substantial time and money to prepare themselves for the test, they felt it would be unfair to scrap the results.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.,</em> at A772\xe2\x80\x93A773, A785\xe2\x80\x93A789.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other firefighters had a different view.  A number of the exam questions, they pointed out, were not germane to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s practices and procedures.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.,</em> at A774\xe2\x80\x93A784.  At least two candidates opposed to certification noted unequal access to study materials.  Some individuals, they asserted, had the necessary books even before the syllabus was issued.  Others had to invest substantial sums to purchase the materials and \xe2\x80\x9cwait a month and a half for some of the books because they were on back-order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A858.  These disparities, it was suggested, fell at least in part along racial lines.  While many Caucasian applicants could obtain materials and assistance from relatives in the fire service, the overwhelming majority of minority applicants were \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-generation firefighters\xe2\x80\x9d without such support networks.  See <em>id.,</em> at A857\xe2\x80\x93A861, A886\xe2\x80\x93A887.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A representative of the Northeast Region of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, Donald Day, also spoke at the second meeting.  Statistical disparities, he told the CSB, had been present in the Department\xe2\x80\x99s previous promotional exams.  On earlier tests, however, a few minority candidates had fared well enough to earn promotions.  <em>Id.,</em> at A828.  See also App. 218\xe2\x80\x93219.  Day contrasted New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s experience with that of nearby Bridgeport, where minority firefighters held one-third of lieutenant and captain positions.  Bridgeport, Day observed, had once used a testing process similar to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s, with a written exam accounting for 70 percent of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s score, an oral exam for 25 percent, and seniority for the remaining five percent.  CA2 App. A830.  Bridgeport recognized, however, that the oral component, more so than the written component, addressed the sort of \xe2\x80\x9creal-life scenarios\xe2\x80\x9d fire officers encounter on the job.  <em>Id.,</em> at A832.  Accordingly, that city \xe2\x80\x9cchanged the relative weights\xe2\x80\x9d to give primacy to the oral exam.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Since that time, Day reported, Bridgeport had seen minorities \xe2\x80\x9cfairly represented\xe2\x80\x9d in its exam results.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSB\xe2\x80\x99s third meeting featured IOS representative Legel, the leader of the team that had designed and administered the exams for New Haven.  Several City officials also participated in the discussion.  Legel described the exam development process in detail.  The City, he recounted, had set the \xe2\x80\x9cparameters\xe2\x80\x9d for the exams, specifically, the requirement of written and oral components with a 60/40 weighting.  <em>Id.,</em> at A923, A974.  For security reasons, Department officials had not been permitted to check the content of the questions prior to their administration.  Instead, IOS retained a senior fire officer from Georgia to review the exams \xe2\x80\x9cfor content and fidelity to the source material.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A936.  Legel defended the exams as \xe2\x80\x9cfacially neutral,\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould stand by the[ir] validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A962.  City officials did not dispute the neutrality of IOS\xe2\x80\x99s work.  But, they cautioned, even if individual exam questions had no intrinsic bias, the selection process as a whole may nevertheless have been deficient.  The officials urged the CSB to consult with experts about the \xe2\x80\x9clarger picture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1012.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At its fourth meeting, CSB solicited the views of three individuals with testing-related expertise.  Dr. Christopher Hornick, an industrial/organizational psychology consultant with 25 years\xe2\x80\x99 experience with police and firefighter testing, described the exam results as having \xe2\x80\x9crelatively high adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1028.  Most of the tests he had developed, Hornick stated, exhibited \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly and dramatically less adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1029.  Hornick downplayed the notion of \xe2\x80\x9cfacial neutrality.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was more important, he advised the CSB, to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe broader issue of how your procedures and your rules and the types of tests that you are using are contributing to the adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1038.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, Hornick questioned New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s union-prompted 60/40 written/oral examination structure, noting the availability of \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent types of testing procedures that are much more valid in terms of identifying the best potential supervisors in [the] fire department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1032.  He suggested, for example, \xe2\x80\x9can assessment center process, which is essentially an opportunity for candidates \xe2\x80\xa6 to demonstrate how they would address a particular problem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option on a written test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1039\xe2\x80\x93A1040.  Such selection processes, Hornick said, better \xe2\x80\x9cidentif[y] the best possible people\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate dramatically less adverse impacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hornick added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to at least 10,000, maybe 15,000 firefighters in group settings in my consulting practice and I have never one time ever had anyone in the fire service say to me, \xe2\x80\x98Well, the person who answers\xe2\x80\x94gets the highest score on a written job knowledge, multiple-guess test makes the best company officer.\xe2\x80\x99  We know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as valid as other procedures that exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1033.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>id.,</em> at A1042\xe2\x80\x93A1043 (\xe2\x80\x9cI think a person\xe2\x80\x99s leadership skills, their command presence, their interpersonal skills, their management skills, their tactical skills could have been identified and evaluated in a much more appropriate way.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hornick described the written test itself as \xe2\x80\x9creasonably good,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at A1041, but he criticized the decision not to allow Department officials to check the content.  According to Hornick, this \xe2\x80\x9cinevitably\xe2\x80\x9d led to \xe2\x80\x9ctest[ing] for processes and procedures that don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily match up into the department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1034\xe2\x80\x93A1035.  He preferred \xe2\x80\x9cexperts from within the department who have signed confidentiality agreements \xe2\x80\xa6 to make sure that the terminology and equipment that\xe2\x80\x99s being identified from standardized reading sources apply to the department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1035.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Asked whether he thought the City should certify the results, Hornick hedged: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is adverse impact in the test.  That will be identified in any proceeding that you have.  You will have industrial psychology experts, if it goes to court, on both sides.  And it will not be a pretty or comfortable position for anyone to be in.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1040\xe2\x80\x93A1041.  Perhaps, he suggested, New Haven might certify the results but immediately begin exploring \xe2\x80\x9calternative ways to deal with these issues\xe2\x80\x9d in the future.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1041.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two other witnesses made relatively brief appearances.  Vincent Lewis, a specialist with the Department of Homeland Security and former fire officer in Michigan, believed the exams had generally tested relevant material, although he noted a relatively heavy emphasis on questions pertaining to being an \xe2\x80\x9capparatus driver.\xe2\x80\x9d  He suggested that this may have disadvantaged test takers \xe2\x80\x9cwho had not had the training or had not had an opportunity to drive the apparatus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1051.  He also urged the CSB to consider whether candidates had, in fact, enjoyed equal access to the study materials.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Cf. <em>supra</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Janet Helms, a professor of counseling psychology at Boston College, observed that two-thirds of the incumbent fire officers who submitted job analyses to IOS during the exam design phase were Caucasian.  Members of different racial groups, Helms told the CSB, sometimes do their jobs in different ways, \xe2\x80\x9coften because the experiences that are open to white male firefighters are not open to members of these other under-represented groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A1063\xe2\x80\x93A1064.  The heavy reliance on job analyses from white firefighters, she suggested, may thus have introduced an element of bias.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1063.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSB\xe2\x80\x99s fifth and final meeting began with statements from City officials recommending against certification.  Ude, New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, repeated the applicable disparate-impact standard:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] finding of adverse impact is the beginning, not the end, of a review of testing procedures.  Where a procedure demonstrates adverse impact, you look to how closely it is related to the job that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to fill and you also look at whether there are other ways to test for those qualities, those traits, those positions that are equally valid with less adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1100\xe2\x80\x93A1101.</p>\n<p align="left">\nNew Haven, Ude and other officials asserted, would be vulnerable to Title VII liability under this standard.  Even if the exams were \xe2\x80\x9cfacially neutral,\xe2\x80\x9d significant doubts had been raised about whether they properly assessed the key attributes of a successful fire officer.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1103.  See also <em>id</em>., at A1125 (\xe2\x80\x9cUpon close reading of the exams, the questions themselves would appear to test a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s ability to memorize textbooks but not necessarily to identify solutions to real problems on the fire ground.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, City officials reminded the CSB, Hornick and others had identified better, less discriminatory selection methods\xe2\x80\x93such as assessment centers or exams with a more heavily weighted oral component.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1108\xe2\x80\x93A1109, A1129\xe2\x80\x93A1130.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After giving members of the public a final chance to weigh in, the CSB voted on certification, dividing 2 to 2.  By rule, the result was noncertification.  Voting no, Commissioner Webber stated, \xe2\x80\x9cI originally was going to vote to certify. \xe2\x80\xa6 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard enough testimony here to give me great doubts about the test itself and \xe2\x80\xa6 some of the procedures.  And I believe we can do better.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1157.  Commissioner Tirado likewise concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cflawed\xe2\x80\x9d testing process counseled against certification.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1158.  Chairman Segaloff and Commissioner Caplan voted to certify.  According to Segaloff, the testimony had not \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled [him] to say this exam was not job-related,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was unconvinced that alternative selection processes would be \xe2\x80\x9cless discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at A1159\xe2\x80\x93A1160.  Both Segalhoff and Caplan, however, urged the City to undertake civil service reform.  <em>Id.,</em> at A1150\xe2\x80\x93A1154.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s vote, petitioners\xe2\x80\x9417 white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter, all of whom had high marks on the exams\xe2\x80\x94filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  They named as defendants\xe2\x80\x94respondents here\xe2\x80\x94the City, several City officials, a local political activist, and the two CSB members who voted against certifying the results.  By opposing certification, petitioners alleged, respondents had discriminated against them in violation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provision and the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Protection Clause.  The decision not to certify, respondents answered, was a lawful effort to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision and thus could not have run afoul of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of disparate treatment.  Characterizing respondents\xe2\x80\x99 stated rationale as a mere pretext, petitioners insisted that New Haven would have had a solid defense to any disparate-impact suit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a decision summarily affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the District Court granted summary judgment for respondents.  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 142 (Conn. 2006), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 530 F.\xc2\xa03d 87 (CA2 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Under Second Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe intent to remedy the disparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d of a promotional exam \xe2\x80\x9cis not equivalent to an intent to discriminate against non-minority applicants.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 157 (quoting <em>Hayden</em> v. <em>County of Nassau</em>, 180 F.\xc2\xa03d 42, 51 (CA2 1999)).  Rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 pretext argument, the court observed that the exam results were sufficiently skewed \xe2\x80\x9cto make out a prima facie case of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision.  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 158.  Had New Haven gone forward with certification and been sued by aggrieved minority test takers, the City would have been forced to defend tests that were presumptively invalid.  And, as the CSB testimony of Hornick and others indicated, overcoming that presumption would have been no easy task.  <em>Id</em>., at 153\xe2\x80\x93156.  Given Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s preference for voluntary compliance, the court held, New Haven could lawfully discard the disputed exams even if the City had not definitively \xe2\x80\x9cpinpoint[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the source of the disparity and \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not yet formulated a better selection method.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 156.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents were no doubt conscious of race during their decisionmaking process, the court acknowledged, but this did not mean they had engaged in racially disparate treatment.  The conclusion they had reached and the action thereupon taken were race-neutral in this sense: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll the test results were discarded, no one was promoted, and firefighters of every race will have to participate in another selection process to be considered for promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 158.  New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s action, which gave no individual a preference, \xe2\x80\x9cwas \xe2\x80\x98simply not analogous to a quota system or a minority set-aside where candidates, on the basis of their race, are not treated uniformly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 157 (quoting <em>Hayden</em>, 180 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50).

Congress, the landmark decision recognized, aimed beyond \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate treatment\xe2\x80\x9d; it targeted \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s original text, it was plain to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cproscribe[d] not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 431.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Only by ignoring <em>Griggs </em>could one maintain that intentionally disparate treatment alone was Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coriginal, foundational prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d and disparate impact a mere afterthought.

Matching procedure to substance, the <em>Griggs</em> Court observed, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cplaced on the employer the burden of showing that any given requirement \xe2\x80\xa6 ha[s] a manifest relationship to the employment in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 432.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U.

When an employment test \xe2\x80\x9cselect[s] applicants for hire or promotion in a racial pattern significantly different from the pool of applicants,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reiterated, the employer must demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between test and job.  422 U.

Such a showing, the Court cautioned, does not necessarily mean the employer prevails: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t remains open to the complaining party to show that other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in \xe2\x80\x98efficient and trustworthy workmanship.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal trial and appellate courts applied <em>Griggs </em>and <em>Albemarle </em>to disallow a host of hiring and promotion practices that \xe2\x80\x9coperate[d] as \xe2\x80\x98built in headwinds\xe2\x80\x99 for minority groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griggs</em>, 401 U.

As to business necessity for a practice that disproportionately excludes members of minority groups, <em>Wards Cove </em>held, the employer bears only the burden of production, not the burden of persuasion.  490 U.

And in place of the instruction that the challenged practice \xe2\x80\x9cmust have a manifest relationship to the employment in question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Griggs</em>, 401 U.

H. R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991).  Among the 1991 alterations, Congress formally codified the disparate-impact component of Title VII.  In so amending the statute, Congress made plain its intention to restore \xe2\x80\x9cthe concepts of \xe2\x80\x98business necessity\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98job related\xe2\x80\x99 enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v.

This characterization of an employer\xe2\x80\x99s compliance-directed action shows little attention to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 design or to the <em>Griggs</em> line of cases Congress recognized as pathmarking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur task in interpreting separate provisions of a single Act is to give the Act the most harmonious, comprehensive meaning possible in light of the legislative policy and purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/609/index.html">412 U.

A particular phrase need not \xe2\x80\x9cextend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities\xe2\x80\x9d if an incongruity would result.  <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U.

A reasonable endeavor to comply with the law and to ensure that qualified candidates of all races have a fair opportunity to compete is simply not what Congress meant to interdict.  I would therefore hold that an employer who jettisons a selection device when its disproportionate racial impact becomes apparent does not violate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment bar automatically or at all, subject to this key condition: The employer must have good cause to believe the device would not withstand examination for business necessity.

Employers may attempt to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision, the Court declares, only where there is a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d documenting the necessity of their action.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard, drawn from inapposite equal protection precedents, is not elaborated.  One is left to wonder what cases would meet the standard and why the Court is so sure this case does not.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In construing Title VII, I note preliminarily, equal protection doctrine is of limited utility.  The Equal Protection Clause, this Court has held, prohibits only intentional discrimination; it does not have a disparate-impact component.  See <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U. S. 256</a>, 272 (1979); <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/index.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 239 (1976).  Title VII, in contrast, aims to eliminate all forms of employment discrimination, unintentional as well as deliberate.  Until today, cf. <em>ante</em>, at 25; <em>ante</em>, p. 1 (Scalia, J., concurring), this Court has never questioned the constitutionality of the disparate-impact component of Title VII, and for good reason.  By instructing employers to avoid needlessly exclusionary selection processes, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision calls for a \xe2\x80\x9crace-neutral means to increase minority \xe2\x80\xa6 participation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94something this Court\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection precedents also encourage.  See <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 238 (1995) (quoting <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 493, 585 (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases from which the Court draws its strong-basis-in-evidence standard are particularly inapt; they concern the constitutionality of absolute racial preferences.  See <em>Wygant</em> v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion) (invalidating a school district\xe2\x80\x99s plan to lay off nonminority teachers while retaining minority teachers with less seniority); <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (rejecting a set-aside program for minority contractors that operated as \xe2\x80\x9can unyielding racial quota\xe2\x80\x9d).  An employer\xe2\x80\x99s effort to avoid Title VII liability by repudiating a suspect selection method scarcely resembles those cases.  Race was not merely a relevant consideration in <em>Wygant </em>and <em>Croson;</em> it was the decisive factor.  Observance of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision, in contrast, calls for no racial preference, absolute or otherwise.  The very purpose of the provision is to ensure that individuals are hired and promoted based on qualifications manifestly necessary to successful performance of the job in question, qualifications that do not screen out members of any race.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this litigation underplays a dominant Title VII theme.  This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be read to thwart\xe2\x80\x9d efforts at voluntary compliance.  <em>Johnson</em>, 480 U. S., at 630.  Such compliance, we have explained, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe preferred means of achieving [Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s] objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firefighters</em> v. <em>Cleveland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/501/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/501/index.html">478 U.

The strong-basis-in-evidence standard, however, as barely described in general, and cavalierly applied in this case, makes voluntary compliance a hazardous venture.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, an employer who discards a dubious selection process can anticipate costly disparate-treatment litigation in which its chances for success\xe2\x80\x94even for surviving a summary-judgment motion\xe2\x80\x94are highly problematic.  Concern about exposure to disparate-impact liability, however well grounded, is insufficient to insulate an employer from attack.  Instead, the employer must make a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d showing that (1) its selection method was \xe2\x80\x9cnot job related and consistent with business necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d or (2) that it refused to adopt \xe2\x80\x9can equally valid, less-discriminatory alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  It is hard to see how these requirements differ from demanding that an employer establish \xe2\x80\x9ca provable, actual violation\xe2\x80\x9d <em>against itself</em>.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 24.  There is indeed a sharp conflict here, but it is not the false one the Court describes between Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s core provisions.  It is, instead, the discordance of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with the voluntary compliance ideal.  Cf. <em>Wygant</em>, 476 U. S., at 290 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe imposition of a requirement that public employers make findings that they have engaged in illegal discrimina-\ntion before they [act] would severely undermine public employers\xe2\x80\x99 incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s additional justifications for announcing a strong-basis-in-evidence standard are unimpressive.  First, discarding the results of tests, the Court suggests, calls for a heightened standard because it \xe2\x80\x9cupset[s] an employee\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate expectation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 25.  This rationale puts the cart before the horse.  The legitimacy of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s expectation depends on the legitimacy of the selection method.  If an employer reasonably concludes that an exam fails to identify the most qualified individuals and needlessly shuts out a segment of the applicant pool, Title VII surely does not compel the employer to hire or promote based on the test, however unreliable it may be.  Indeed, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prime objective is to prevent exclusionary practices from \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] to \xe2\x80\x98freeze\xe2\x80\x99 the status quo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griggs</em>, 401 U. S., at 430.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court suggests, anything less than a strong-basis-in-evidence standard risks creating \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>de facto </em>quota system, in which \xe2\x80\xa6 an employer could discard test results \xe2\x80\xa6 with the intent of obtaining the employer\xe2\x80\x99s preferred racial balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  Under a reasonableness standard, however, an employer could not cast aside a selection method based on a statistical disparity alone.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The employer must have good cause to believe that the method screens out qualified applicants and would be difficult to justify as grounded in business necessity.  Should an employer repeatedly reject test results, it would be fair, I agree, to infer that the employer is simply seeking a racially balanced outcome and is not genuinely endeavoring to comply with Title VII.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court stacks the deck further by denying respondents any chance to satisfy the newly announced strong-basis-in-evidence standard.  When this Court formulates a new legal rule, the ordinary course is to remand and allow the lower courts to apply the rule in the first instance.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/499/index.html">543 U. S. 499</a>, 515 (2005); <em>Pullman-Standard</em> v. <em>Swint</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/273/index.html">456 U. S. 273</a>, 291 (1982).  I see no good reason why the Court fails to follow that course in this case.  Indeed, the sole basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory ruling is the demonstrably false pretension that respondents showed \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9ca significant statistical disparity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328; see <em>supra</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa08.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying what I view as the proper standard to the record thus far made, I would hold that New Haven had ample cause to believe its selection process was flawed and not justified by business necessity.  Judged by that standard, petitioners have not shown that New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s failure to certify the exam results violated Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-treatment provision.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City, all agree, \xe2\x80\x9cwas faced with a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 27: The pass rate for minority candidates was half the rate for nonminority candidates, and virtually no minority candidates would have been eligible for promotion had the exam results been certified.  Alerted to this stark disparity, the CSB heard expert and lay testimony, presented at public hearings, in an endeavor to ascertain whether the exams were fair and consistent with business necessity.  Its investigation revealed grave cause for concern about the exam process itself and the City\xe2\x80\x99s failure to consider alternative selection devices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief among the City\xe2\x80\x99s problems was the very nature of the tests for promotion.  In choosing to use written and oral exams with a 60/40 weighting, the City simply adhered to the union\xe2\x80\x99s preference and apparently gave no consideration to whether the weighting was likely to identify the most qualified fire-officer candidates.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  There is strong reason to think it was not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying heavily on written tests to select fire officers is a questionable practice, to say the least.  Successful fire officers, the City\xe2\x80\x99s description of the position makes clear, must have the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bility to lead personnel effectively, maintain discipline, promote harmony, exercise sound judgment, and cooperate with other officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A432.  These qualities are not well measured by written tests.  Testifying before the CSB, Christopher Hornick, an exam-design expert with more than two decades of relevant experience, was emphatic on this point: Leadership skills, command presence, and the like \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been identified and evaluated in a much more appropriate way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at A1042\xe2\x80\x93A1043.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s commonsense observation is mirrored in case law and in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s administrative guidelines.  Courts have long criticized written firefighter promotion exams for being \xe2\x80\x9cmore probative of the test-taker\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recall what a particular text stated on a given topic than of his firefighting or supervisory knowledge and abilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vulcan Pioneers, Inc.</em> v. <em>New Jersey Dept. of Civil Serv.</em>, 625 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 527, 539 (NJ 1985).  A fire officer\xe2\x80\x99s job, courts have observed, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves complex behaviors, good interpersonal skills, the ability to make decisions under tremendous pressure, and a host of other abilities\xe2\x80\x94none of which is easily measured by a written, multiple choice test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firefighters Inst. for Racial Equality</em> v. <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>, 616 F.\xc2\xa02d 350, 359 (CA8 1980).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Interpreting the Uniform Guidelines, EEOC and other federal agencies responsible for enforcing equal opportunity employment laws have similarly recognized that, as measures of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpersonal relations\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cability to function under danger (<em>e.g.</em>, firefighters),\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[p]encil-and-paper tests \xe2\x80\xa6 generally are not close enough approximations of work behaviors to show content validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  44 Fed. Reg. 12007 (1979).  See also 29 CFR \xc2\xa71607.15(C)(4).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these unfavorable appraisals, it is unsurprising that most municipal employers do not evaluate their fire-officer candidates as New Haven does.  Although comprehensive statistics are scarce, a 1996 study found that nearly two-thirds of surveyed municipalities used assessment centers (\xe2\x80\x9csimulations of the real world of work\xe2\x80\x9d) as part of their promotion processes.  P. Lowry, A Survey of the Assessment Center Process in the Public Sector, 25 Public Personnel Management 307, 315 (1996).  That figure represented a marked increase over the previous decade, see <em>ibid.</em>, so the percentage today may well be even higher.  Among municipalities still relying in part on written exams, the median weight assigned to them was 30 percent\xe2\x80\x94half the weight given to New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s written exam.  <em>Id</em>., at 309.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Testimony before the CSB indicated that these alternative methods were both more reliable and notably less discriminatory in operation.  According to Donald Day of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, nearby Bridgeport saw less skewed results after switching to a selection process that placed primary weight on an oral exam.  CA2 App. A830\xe2\x80\x93A832; see <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And Hornick described assessment centers as \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[ing] dramatically less adverse impacts\xe2\x80\x9d than written exams.  CA2 App. A1040.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Considering the prevalence of these proven alternatives, New Haven was poorly positioned to argue that promotions based on its outmoded and exclusionary selection process qualified as a business necessity.  Cf. <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Lorillard Corp.</em>, 444 F.\xc2\xa02d 791, 798, n. 7 (CA4 1971) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt should go without saying that a practice is hardly \xe2\x80\x98necessary\xe2\x80\x99 if an alternative practice better effectuates its intended purpose or is equally effective but less discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ignoring the conceptual and other defects in New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s selection process, the Court describes the exams as \xe2\x80\x9cpainstaking[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d developed to test \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d material and on that basis finds no substantial risk of disparate-impact liability.  See <em>ante</em>, at 28.  Perhaps such reasoning would have sufficed under <em>Wards Cove</em>, which permitted exclusionary practices as long as they advanced an employer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d goals.  490 U. S., at 659.  But Congress repudiated <em>Wards Cove</em> and reinstated the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d rule attended by a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest relationship\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See <em>Griggs</em>, 401 U. S., at 431\xe2\x80\x93432.  See also <em>supra</em>, at 17.  Like the chess player who tries to win by sweeping the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s pieces off the table, the Court simply shuts from its sight the formidable obstacles New Haven would have faced in defending against a disparate-impact suit.  See <em>Lanning</em> v. <em>Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth.</em>, 181 F.\xc2\xa03d 478, 489 (CA3 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudicial application of a standard focusing solely on whether the qualities measured by an \xe2\x80\xa6 exam bear some relationship to the job in question would impermissibly write out the business necessity prong of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s chosen standard.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That IOS representative Chad Legel and his team may have been diligent in designing the exams says little about the exams\xe2\x80\x99 suitability for selecting fire officers.  IOS worked within the City\xe2\x80\x99s constraints.  Legel never discussed with the City the propriety of the 60/40 weighting and \xe2\x80\x9cwas not asked to consider the possibility of an assessment center.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A522.  See also <em>id</em>., at A467.  The IOS exams, Legel admitted, had not even attempted to assess \xe2\x80\x9ccommand presence\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou would probably be better off with an assessment center if you cared to measure that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at A521.  Cf. <em>Boston Chapter, NAACP </em>v. <em>Beecher</em>, 504 F.\xc2\xa02d 1017, 1021\xe2\x80\x931022 (CA1 1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cA test fashioned from materials pertaining to the job \xe2\x80\xa6 superficially may seem job-related.  But what is at issue is whether it demonstrably selects people who will perform better the required on-the-job behaviors.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the highly questionable character of the exams and the neglect of available alternatives, the City had other reasons to worry about its vulnerability to disparate-impact liability.  Under the City\xe2\x80\x99s ground rules, IOS was not allowed to show the exams to anyone in the New Haven Fire Department prior to their administration.  This \xe2\x80\x9cprecluded [IOS] from being able to engage in [its] normal subject matter expert review process\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94something Legel described as \xe2\x80\x9cvery critical.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A477, A506.  As a result, some of the exam questions were confusing or irrelevant, and the exams may have over-tested some subject-matter areas while missing others.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at A1034\xe2\x80\x93A1035, A1051.  Testimony before the CSB also raised questions concerning unequal access to study materials, see <em>id</em>., at A857\xe2\x80\x93A861, and the potential bias introduced by relying principally on job analyses from nonminority fire officers to develop the exams, see <em>id</em>., at A1063\xe2\x80\x93A1064.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  See also <em>supra</em>, at 7, 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court criticizes New Haven for failing to obtain a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical report\xe2\x80\x9d from IOS, which, the Court maintains, would have provided \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed information to establish the validity of the exams.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 29.  The record does not substantiate this assertion.  As Legel testified during his deposition, the technical report merely summarized \xe2\x80\x9cthe steps that [IOS] took methodologically speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d and would not have established the exams\xe2\x80\x99 reliability.  CA2 App. A461.  See also <em>id</em>., at A462 (the report \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything that other documents that already existed wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the record solidly establishes that the City had good cause to fear disparate-impact liability.  Moreover, the Court supplies no tenable explanation why the evidence of the tests\xe2\x80\x99 multiple deficiencies does not create at least a triable issue under a strong-basis-in-evidence standard.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concurring in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, Justice Alito asserts that summary judgment for respondents would be improper even if the City had good cause for its noncertification decision.  A reasonable jury, he maintains, could have found that respondents were not actually motivated by concern about disparate-impact litigation, but instead sought only \xe2\x80\x9cto placate a politically important [African-American] constituency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  As earlier noted, I would not oppose a remand for further proceedings fair to both sides.  See <em>supra</em>, at 26, n. 10.  It is the Court that has chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its pretension that the City has shown, and can show, nothing more than a statistical disparity.  See <em>supra</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa08, 25.  Justice Alito compounds the Court\xe2\x80\x99s error.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Offering a truncated synopsis of the many hours of deliberations undertaken by the CSB, Justice Alito finds evidence suggesting that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 stated desire to comply with Title VII was insincere, a mere \xe2\x80\x9cpretext\xe2\x80\x9d for discrimination against white firefighters.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  In support of his assertion, Justice Alito recounts at length the alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber (a local political activist), Mayor John DeStefano, and certain members of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s staff.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the allegations Justice Alito repeats are drawn from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 statement of facts they deem undisputed, a statement displaying an adversarial zeal not uncommonly found in such presentations.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  What cannot credibly be denied, however, is that the decision against certification of the exams was made neither by Kimber nor by the mayor and his staff.  The relevant decision was made by the CSB, an unelected, politically insulated body.  It is striking that Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself, perhaps because there is scant evidence that its motivation was anything other than to comply with Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s disparate-impact provision.  Notably, petitioners did not even seek to take depositions of the two commissioners who voted against certification.

CA2 App. A1605, A1611.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito discounts these sworn statements, suggesting that the CSB\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations were tainted by the preferences of Kimber and City officials, whether or not the CSB itself was aware of the taint.  Kimber and City officials, Justice Alito speculates, decided early on to oppose certification and then \xe2\x80\x9cengineered\xe2\x80\x9d a skewed presentation to the CSB to achieve their preferred outcome.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, Justice Alito exaggerates the influence of these actors.  The CSB, the record reveals, designed and conducted an inclusive decisionmaking process, in which it heard from numerous individuals on both sides of the certification question.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, CA2 App. A1090.  Kimber and others no doubt used strong words to urge the CSB not to certify the exam results, but the CSB received \xe2\x80\x9cpressure\xe2\x80\x9d from supporters of certification as well as opponents.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Petitioners, for example, engaged counsel to speak on their behalf before the CSB.  Their counsel did not mince words: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f you discard these results,\xe2\x80\x9d she warned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will get sued.  You will force the taxpayers of the city of New Haven into protracted litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A816.

Discarding the test results, the union\xe2\x80\x99s president told the CSB, would be \xe2\x80\x9ctotally ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at A806.  He insisted, inaccurately, that the City was not at risk of disparate-impact liability because the exams were administered pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9ca collective bargaining agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at A1137.  Cf. <em>supra</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, n.\xc2\xa011.  Never mentioned by Justice Alito in his attempt to show testing expert Christopher Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s alliance with the City, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, the CSB solicited Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at the union\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, not the City\xe2\x80\x99s.  CA2 App. A1128.  Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s cogent testimony raised substantial doubts about the exams\xe2\x80\x99 reliability.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is scant cause to suspect that maneuvering or overheated rhetoric, from either side, prevented the CSB from evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams and rendering an independent, good-faith decision on certification.  Justice Alito acknowledges that the CSB had little patience for Kimber\xe2\x80\x99s antics.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  As to petitioners, Chairman Segaloff\xe2\x80\x94who voted to certify the exam results\xe2\x80\x94dismissed the threats made by their counsel as unhelpful and needlessly \xe2\x80\x9cinflammatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  CA2 App. A821.  Regarding the views expressed by City officials, the CSB made clear that they were entitled to no special weight.  <em>Id.</em>, at A1080.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s analysis contains a more fundamental flaw: It equates political considerations with unlawful discrimination.  As Justice Alito sees it, if the mayor and his staff were motivated by their desire \xe2\x80\x9cto placate a \xe2\x80\xa6 racial constituency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 3, then they engaged in unlawful discrimination against petitioners.  But Justice Alito fails to ask a vital question: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]lacate\xe2\x80\x9d how?  That political officials would have politics in mind is hardly extraordinary, and there are many ways in which a politician can attempt to win over a constituency\xe2\x80\x94including a racial constituency\xe2\x80\x94without engaging in unlawful discrimination.  As courts have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]oliticians routinely respond to bad press \xe2\x80\xa6 , but it is not a violation of Title VII to take advantage of a situation to gain political favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Henry</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 507 F.\xc2\xa03d 558, 567 (CA7 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The real issue, then, is not whether the mayor and his staff were politically motivated; it is whether their attempt to score political points was legitimate (<em>i.e.</em>, nondiscriminatory).  Were they seeking to exclude white firefighters from promotion (unlikely, as a fair test would undoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to the officer ranks), or did they realize, at least belatedly, that their tests could be toppled in a disparate-impact suit?  In the latter case, there is no disparate-treatment violation.  Justice Alito, I recognize, would disagree.  In his view, an employer\xe2\x80\x99s action to avoid Title VII disparate-impact liability qualifies as a presumptively improper race-based employment decision.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2.  I reject that construction of Title VII.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  As I see it, when employers endeavor to avoid exposure to disparate-impact liability, they do not thereby encounter liability for disparate treatment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this understanding of Title VII, supported by <em>Griggs </em>and the long line of decisions following <em>Griggs</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, and nn. 3\xe2\x80\x934,<em> </em>the District Court found no genuine dispute of material fact.  That court noted, particularly, the guidance furnished by Second Circuit precedent.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that City officials took account of politics, the District Court determined, simply \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not suffice\xe2\x80\x9d to create an inference of unlawful discrimination.  554 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 160, n.\xc2\xa012.  The noncertification decision, even if undertaken \xe2\x80\x9cin a political context,\xe2\x80\x9d reflected a legitimate \xe2\x80\x9cintent not to implement a promotional process based on testing results that had an adverse impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 158, 160.  Indeed, the District Court perceived \xe2\x80\x9ca total absence of any evidence of discriminatory animus towards [petitioners].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 158.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 162 (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the record in this case suggests that the City defendants or CSB acted \xe2\x80\x98because of\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory animus toward [petitioners] or other non-minority applicants for promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Perhaps the District Court could have been more expansive in its discussion of these issues, but its conclusions appear entirely consistent with the record before it.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is indeed regrettable that the City\xe2\x80\x99s noncertification decision would have required all candidates to go through another selection process.  But it would have been more regrettable to rely on flawed exams to shut out candidates who may well have the command presence and other qualities needed to excel as fire officers.  Yet that is the choice the Court makes today.  It is a choice that breaks the promise of <em>Griggs</em> that groups long denied equal opportunity would not be held back by tests \xe2\x80\x9cfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s specific arguments are unavailing.  First, the Court suggests, changing the oral/written weighting may have violated Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on altering test scores.  <em>Ante</em>, at 31.  No one is arguing, however, that the results of the exams given should have been altered.  Rather, the argument is that the City could have availed itself of a better option when it initially decided what selection process to use.  Second, with respect to assessment centers, the Court identifies \xe2\x80\x9cstatements to the CSB indicat[ing] that the Department could not have used [them] for the 2003 examinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  The Court comes up with only a single statement on this subject\xe2\x80\x94an offhand remark made by petitioner Ricci, who hardly qualifies as an expert in testing methods.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  Given the large number of municipalities that regularly use assessment centers, it is impossible to fathom why the City, with proper planning, could not have done so as well.</p>\n<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The I-O Psychologists Brief identifies still other, more technical flaws in the exams that may well have precluded the City from prevailing in a disparate-impact suit.  Notably, the exams were never shown to be suitably precise to allow strict rank ordering of candidates.  A difference of one or two points on a multiple-choice exam should not be decisive of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s promotion chances if that difference bears little relationship to the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for the job.  Relatedly, it appears that the line between a passing and failing score did not accurately differentiate between qualified and unqualified candidates.  A number of fire-officer promotional exams have been invalidated on these bases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Guardians Assn.</em>, 630 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 105 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a cutoff score unrelated to job performance produces disparate racial results, Title VII is violated.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Vulcan Pioneers, Inc.</em> v. <em>New Jersey Dept. of Civil Serv.</em>, 625 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 527, 538 (NJ 1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he tests here at issue are not appropriate for ranking candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Some of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 so-called facts find little support in the record, and many others can scarcely be deemed material.  Petitioners allege, for example, that City officials prevented New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s fire chief and assistant chief from sharing their views about the exams with the CSB.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931428, p. 228a.  None of the materials petitioners cite, however, \xe2\x80\x9csuggests\xe2\x80\x9d that this proposition is accurate.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 5.  In her deposition testimony, City official Karen Dubois-Walton specifically denied that she or her colleagues directed the chief and assistant chief not to appear.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931428, p. 850a.  Moreover, contrary to the insinuations of petitioners and Justice Alito, the statements made by City officials before the CSB did not emphasize allegations of cheating by test takers.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  In her deposition, Dubois-Walton acknowledged sharing the cheating allegations not with the CSB, but with a different City commission.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931428, p. 837a.  Justice Alito also reports that the City\xe2\x80\x99s attorney advised the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s team that the way to convince the CSB not to certify was \xe2\x80\x9cto focus on something other than \xe2\x80\x98a big discussion re: adverse impact\xe2\x80\x99 law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931428, p. 458a).  This is a misleading abbreviation of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s advice.  Focusing on the exams\xe2\x80\x99 defects and on disparate-impact law is precisely what he recommended.  See <em>id</em>., at 458a\xe2\x80\x93459a.</p>\n<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0City officials, Justice Alito reports, sent Hornick newspaper accounts and other material about the exams prior to his testimony.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  Some of these materials, Justice Alito intimates, may have given Hornick an inaccurate portrait of the exams.  But Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s testimony before the CSB, viewed in full, indicates that Hornick had an accurate understanding of the exam process.  Much of Hornick\xe2\x80\x99s analysis focused on the 60/40 weighting of the written and oral exams, something that neither the Court nor the concurrences even attempt to defend.  It is, moreover, entirely misleading to say that the City later hired union-proposed Hornick as a \xe2\x80\x9crewar[d]\xe2\x80\x9d for his testimony.  Cf. <em>Ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be clear, the Board of Fire Commissioners on which Kimber served is an entity separate from the CSB.  Kimber was <em>not</em> a member of the CSB.  Kimber, Justice Alito states, requested a private meeting with the CSB.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  There is not a shred of evidence that a private meeting with Kimber or anyone else took place.</p>\n<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Alito points to evidence that the mayor had decided not to make promotions based on the exams even if the CSB voted to certify the results, going so far as to prepare a press release to that effect.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  If anything, this evidence reinforces the conclusion that the CSB\xe2\x80\x94which made the noncertification decision\xe2\x80\x94remained independent and above the political fray.  The mayor and his staff needed a contingency plan precisely because they did not control the CSB.</p>\n<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court, Justice Alito writes, \xe2\x80\x9call but conceded that a jury could find that the City\xe2\x80\x99s asserted justification was pretextual\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cadmitt[ing] that \xe2\x80\x98a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because they knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the wrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential leaders of New Haven\xe2\x80\x99s African-American community.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3, 13 (quoting 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 162).  The District Court drew the quoted passage from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 lower court brief, and used it in reference to a First Amendment claim not before this Court.  In any event, it is not apparent why these alleged political maneuvers suggest an intent to discriminate against petitioners.  That City officials may have wanted to please political supporters is entirely consistent with their stated desire to avoid a disparate-impact violation.  Cf. <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Iqbal</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18) (allegations that senior Government officials condoned the arrest and detention of thousands of Arab Muslim men following the September 11 attacks failed to establish even a \xe2\x80\x9cplausible inference\xe2\x80\x9d of unlawful discrimination sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div>'
