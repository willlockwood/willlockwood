First, it found that the word "mere" informed the jury "to ignore only the sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the penalty phase." Ibid. (emphasis added). "By concentrating on the noun \'sympathy,\' " the defendant had "ignore[d] the crucial fact that the jury was instructed to avoid basing its decision on mere sympathy." Ibid. (emphasis in original). Second, the majority deemed it "highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would almost perversely single out the word \'sympathy\' from the other nouns which accompany it in the instruction : conjecture, passion, prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling."

Brown, supra, is applicable to the jury instruction at issue in this case. Here, the jury was informed that sympathy should not influence its decision under any circumstances. The trial court\'s all-inclusive no-sympathy instruction, thus, embraced sympathy engendered by facts in the record as well as sympathy engendered by "extraneous emotional factors." Ibid. Furthermore, unlike the instruction in Brown, the instruction here was not contained in "a catalog of the kind of factors that could improperly influence a juror\'s decision to vote for or against the death penalty." Ibid. Reasonable jurors, therefore, may well have thought they were not permitted to exercise mercy or compassion when sentencing petitioner, even if such feelings were " rooted" in the evidence.
