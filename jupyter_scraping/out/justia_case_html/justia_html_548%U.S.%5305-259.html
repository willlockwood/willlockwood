S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a), and its anti-retaliation provision forbids \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] against\xe2\x80\x9d an employee or job applicant who, <em>inter alia, </em>has \xe2\x80\x9cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\xe2\x80\x9d a Title VII proceeding or investigation, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  Respondent White, the only woman in her department, operated the forklift at the Tennessee Yard of petitioner Burlington Northern &amp; Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Railway Co. (Burlington).  After she complained, her immediate supervisor was disciplined for sexual harassment, but she was removed from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks.  She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that the reassignment was unlawful gender discrimination and retaliation for her complaint.  Subsequently, she was suspended without pay for insubordination.  Burlington later found that she had not been insubordinate, reinstated her, and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was suspended.  The suspension led to another EEOC retaliation charge.  After exhausting her administrative remedies, White filed an action against Burlington in federal court claiming, as relevant here, that Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s actions in changing her job responsibilities and suspending her for 37 days amounted to unlawful retaliation under Title VII.  A jury awarded her compensatory damages.  In affirming, the Sixth Circuit applied the same standard for retaliation that it applies to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that a retaliation plaintiff must show an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d of employment.  The Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace.  The language of the substantive and anti-retaliation provisions differ in important ways.  The terms \xe2\x80\x9chire,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cemployment opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstatus as an employee\xe2\x80\x9d explicitly limit the substantive provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope to actions that affect employment or alter workplace conditions.  The anti-retaliation provision has no such limiting words.  This Court presumes that, where words differ as they do here, Congress has acted intentionally and purposely.  There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences here, for the two provisions differ not only in language but also in purpose.  The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their status, while the anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent an employer from interfering with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic guarantees.  To secure the first objective, Congress needed only to prohibit employment-related discrimination.  But this would not achieve the second objective because it would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take, therefore failing to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms,\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 346.  Thus, purpose reinforces what the language says, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision is not limited to actions affecting employment terms and conditions.  Neither this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent nor the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations support a contrary conclusion.  Nor is it anomalous to read the statute to provide broader protection for retaliation victims than for victims of discrimination.  Congress has provided similar protection from retaliation in comparable statutes.  And differences in the purpose of the two Title VII provisions remove any perceived \xe2\x80\x9canomaly,\xe2\x80\x9d for they justify this difference in interpretation.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The anti-retaliation provision covers only those employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or applicant.  This Court agrees with the Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits that the proper formulation requires a retaliation plaintiff to show that the challenged action \xe2\x80\x9cwell might have \xe2\x80\x98dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rochon </em>v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa03d 1211, 1219.  The Court refers to <em>material</em> adversity to separate significant from trivial harms.  The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered access\xe2\x80\x9d to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial mechanisms by prohibiting employer actions that are likely to deter discrimination victims from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and employers.  <em>Robinson, supra, </em>at 346.  The Court refers to a <em>reasonable </em>employee\xe2\x80\x99s reactions because the provision\xe2\x80\x99s standard for judging harm must be objective, and thus judicially administrable.  The standard is phrased in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation may depend upon the particular circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Applying the standard to the facts of this case, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on White\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim.  Contrary to Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s claim, a reassignment of duties can constitute retaliatory discrimination where both the former and present duties fall within the same job description.  Almost every job category involves some duties that are less desirable than others.  That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently recognized retaliatory work assignments as forbidden retaliation.  Here, the jury had considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were more arduous and dirtier than the forklift operator position, and that the latter position was considered a better job by male employees who resented White for occupying it.  Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.  Burlington also argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because White was reinstated with backpay.  The significance of the congressional judgment that victims of intentional discrimination can recover compensatory and punitive damages to make them whole would be undermined if employers could avoid liability in these circumstances.  Any insufficient evidence claim is unconvincing.  White received backpay, but many reasonable employees would find a month without pay a serious hardship.  White described her physical and emotional hardship to the jury, noting that she obtained medical treatment for emotional distress.  An indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent to the filing of a discrimination complaint, even if the suspended employee eventually receives backpay.  Thus, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the suspension was materially adverse was reasonable.

L. 88\xe2\x80\x93352, \xc2\xa7704, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  A separate section of the Act\xe2\x80\x94its anti-retaliation provision\xe2\x80\x94forbids an employer from \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ing] against\xe2\x80\x9d an employee or job applicant because that individual \xe2\x80\x9copposed any practice\xe2\x80\x9d made unlawful by Title VII or \xe2\x80\x9cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\xe2\x80\x9d a Title VII proceeding or investigation.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions about the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision, particularly the reach of its phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against.\xe2\x80\x9d  Does that provision confine actionable retaliation to activity that affects the terms and conditions of employment?  And how harmful must the adverse actions be to fall within its scope?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace.  We also conclude that the provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant.  In the present context that means that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises out of actions that supervisors at petitioner Burlington Northern &amp; Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Railway Company took against respondent Sheila White, the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way department at Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s Tennessee Yard.  In June 1997, Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s roadmaster, Marvin Brown, interviewed White and expressed interest in her previous experience operating forklifts.  Burlington hired White as a \xe2\x80\x9ctrack laborer,\xe2\x80\x9d a job that involves removing and replacing track components, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way.  Soon after White arrived on the job, a co-worker who had previously operated the forklift chose to assume other responsibilities.  Brown immediately assigned White to operate the forklift.  While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White\xe2\x80\x99s primary responsibility.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 1997, White complained to Burlington officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department.  Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues.  After an internal investigation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training session.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner\xe2\x80\x99s discipline.  At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to perform only standard track laborer tasks.  Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s complaints that, in fairness, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98more senior man\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d should have the \xe2\x80\x9cless arduous and cleaner job\xe2\x80\x9d of forklift operator.  364 F.\xc2\xa03d 789, 792 (CA6 2004) (case below).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission).  She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner.  In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activities.  That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should transport White from one location to another.  The specific facts of the disagreement are in dispute, but the upshot is that Sharkey told Brown later that afternoon that White had been insubordinate.  Brown immediately suspended White without pay.  White invoked internal grievance procedures.  Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had <em>not</em> been insubordinate.  Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was suspended.  White filed an additional retaliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed this Title VII action against Burlington in federal court.  As relevant here, she claimed that Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s actions\xe2\x80\x94(1) changing her job responsibilities, and (2) suspending her for 37 days without pay\xe2\x80\x94amounted to unlawful retaliation in violation of Title VII.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  A jury found in White\xe2\x80\x99s favor on both of these claims.  It awarded her $43,500 in compensatory damages, including $3,250 in medical expenses.  The District Court denied Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Initially, a divided Sixth Circuit panel reversed the judgment and found in Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s favor on the retaliation claims.  310 F.\xc2\xa03d 443 (2002).  The full Court of Appeals vacated the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, and heard the matter en banc.  The court then affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in White\xe2\x80\x99s favor on both retaliation claims.  While all members of the en banc court voted to uphold the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, they differed as to the proper standard to apply.  Compare 364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 795\xe2\x80\x93800, with <em>id</em>., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision forbids employer actions that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against\xe2\x80\x9d an employee (or job applicant) because he has \xe2\x80\x9copposed\xe2\x80\x9d a practice that Title VII forbids or has \xe2\x80\x9cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\xe2\x80\x9d a Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation, proceeding, or hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  No one doubts that the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against\xe2\x80\x9d refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals.  See <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2005); <em>Price Waterhouse</em> v. <em>Hopkins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/228/index.html">490 U. S. 228</a>, 244 (1989) (plurality opinion); see also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 758 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 3b).  But different Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some Circuits have insisted upon a close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment.  The Sixth Circuit majority in this case, for example, said that a plaintiff must show an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d which it defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d of employment.  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 795 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Sixth Circuit has thus joined those Courts of Appeals that apply the same standard for retaliation that they apply to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that the challenged action must \xe2\x80\x9cresul[t] in an adverse effect on the \xe2\x80\x98terms, conditions, or benefits\xe2\x80\x99 of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Von Gunten</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 858, 866 (CA4 2001); see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh</em>, 120 F.\xc2\xa03d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997).  The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have adopted a more restrictive approach.  They employ an \xe2\x80\x9cultimate employment decisio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d standard, which limits actionable retaliatory conduct to acts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mattern </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co</em>., 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 702, 707 (CA5 1997); see <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, 127 F.\xc2\xa03d 686, 692 (CA8 1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other Circuits have not so limited the scope of the provision.  The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits have said that the plaintiff must show that the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x99s challenged action would have been material to a reasonable employee,\xe2\x80\x9d which in contexts like the present one means that it would likely have \xe2\x80\x9cdissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Illinois</em> <em>Dept. of Revenue</em>, 420 F.\xc2\xa03d 658, 662 (CA7 2005); see <em>Rochon </em>v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa03d 1211, 1217\xe2\x80\x931218 (CADC 2006).  And the Ninth Circuit, following EEOC guidance, has said that the plaintiff must simply establish \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Henderson</em>, 217 F.\xc2\xa03d 1234, 1242\xe2\x80\x931243 (CA9 2000).  The concurring judges below would have applied this last mentioned standard.  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 809 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement.  To do so requires us to decide whether Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.  And we must characterize how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner and the Solicitor General both argue that the Sixth Circuit is correct to require a link between the challenged retaliatory action and the terms, conditions, or status of employment.  They note that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s substantive anti-discrimination provision protects an individual only from employment-related discrimination.  They add that the anti-retaliation provision should be read <em>in pari materia</em> with the anti-discrimination provision.  And they conclude that the employer actions prohibited by the anti-retaliation provision should similarly be limited to conduct that \xe2\x80\x9caffects the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13 (quoting \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)); see Brief for Petitioner 13 (same).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot agree.  The language of the substantive provision differs from that of the anti-retaliation provision in important ways.  Section 703(a) sets forth Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s core anti-discrimination provision in the following terms:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82<em>to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge</em> any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual <em>with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment</em>, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way <em>which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee</em>, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision in the following terms:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer <em>to discriminate against</em> any of his employees or applicants for employment \xe2\x80\xa6 because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The underscored words in the substantive provision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chire,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cemployment opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstatus as an employee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace.  No such limiting words appear in the anti-retaliation provision.  Given these linguistic differences, the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read <em>in pari materia </em>to mean the same thing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pasquantino</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/544/349/index.html">544 U. S. 349</a>, 355, n.\xc2\xa02 (2005); <em>McFarland</em> v. <em>Scott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/849/index.html">512 U. S. 849</a>, 858 (1994); <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Everhart,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/83/index.html">494 U. S. 83</a>, 92 (1990).  Rather, the question is whether Congress intended its different words to make a legal difference.  We normally presume that, where words differ as they differ here, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences that its language suggests, for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well.  The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.  See <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a>, 800\xe2\x80\x93801 (1973).  The anti-retaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic guarantees.  The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i.e.</em>, their status.  The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i.e.</em>, their conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other than employment-related discrimination.  The substantive provision\xe2\x80\x99s basic objective of \xe2\x80\x9cequality of employment opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d and the elimination of practices that tend to bring about \xe2\x80\x9cstratified job environments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 800, would be achieved were\nall employment-related discrimination miraculously\neliminated.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer actions and harm that concern employment and the workplace.  Were all such actions and harms eliminated, the anti-retaliation provision\xe2\x80\x99s objective would <em>not </em>be achieved.  An employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <em>outside</em> the workplace.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rochon </em>v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1213 (FBI retaliation against employee \xe2\x80\x9ctook the form of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death threats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and his wife\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Stevinson Chevrolet</em>, 74 F.\xc2\xa03d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where employer filed false criminal charges against former employee who complained about discrimination).  A provision limited to employment-related actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take.  Hence, such a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 346 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, purpose reinforces what language already indicates, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.  Cf. <em>Wachovia Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A. </em>v.<em> Schmidt,</em> 546 U. S. ___ (2006) (slip op., at 14) (rejecting statutory construction that would \xe2\x80\x9ctrea[t] venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <em>in pari materia</em>\xe2\x80\x9d because doing so would \xe2\x80\x9coverloo[k] the discrete offices of those concepts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedent does not compel a contrary conclusion.  Indeed, we have found no case in this Court that offers petitioner or the United States significant support.  <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a> (1998), as petitioner notes, speaks of a Title VII requirement that violations involve \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9chiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 761.  But <em>Ellerth</em> does so only to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify a class of [hostile work environment] cases\xe2\x80\x9d in which an employer should be held vicariously liable (without an affirmative defense) for the acts of supervisors.  <em>Id</em>., at 760; see also <em>Pennsylvania State Police</em> v. <em>Suders,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/129/index.html">542 U. S. 129</a>, 143 (2004) (explaining holdings in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a> (1998), as dividing hostile work environment claims into two categories, one in which the employer is strictly liable because a tangible employment action is taken and one in which the employer can make an affirmative defense).  <em>Ellerth</em> did not discuss the scope of the general anti-discrimination provision.  See 524 U. S., at 761 (using \xe2\x80\x9cconcept of a tangible employment action [that] appears in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9cfor resolution of the vicarious liability issue\xe2\x80\x9d).  And <em>Ellerth</em> did not mention Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision at all.  At most, <em>Ellerth</em> sets forth a standard that petitioner and the Solicitor General believe the anti-retaliation provision ought to contain.  But it does not compel acceptance of their view.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can we find significant support for their view in the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations of the provision.  We concede that the EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manuals that the anti-retaliation provision is limited to \xe2\x80\x9cadverse employment-related action.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa7614.1(d), p. 614\xe2\x80\x935 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC 1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa7614.1(d), p. 614\xe2\x80\x935 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual).  But in those same manuals the EEOC lists the \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ssential [e]lements\xe2\x80\x9d of a retaliation claim along with language suggesting a broader interpretation.  EEOC 1991 Manual \xc2\xa7614.3(d), pp.\xc2\xa0614\xe2\x80\x938 to 614\xe2\x80\x939 (complainant must show \xe2\x80\x9cthat (s)he was in some manner subjected to adverse treatment by the respondent because of the protest or opposition\xe2\x80\x9d); EEOC 1988 Manual \xc2\xa7614.3(d), pp.\xc2\xa0614\xe2\x80\x938 to 614\xe2\x80\x939 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, both before and after publication of the 1991 and 1988 manuals, the EEOC similarly expressed a broad interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision.  Compare EEOC Interpretive Manual, Reference Manual to Title VII Law for Compliance Personnel \xc2\xa7491.2 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Reference Manual) (\xc2\xa7704(a) \xe2\x80\x9cis intended to provide \xe2\x80\x98exceptionally broad protection\xe2\x80\x99 for protestors of discriminatory employment practices\xe2\x80\x9d), with 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78, p.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313 (1998) (hereinafter EEOC 1998\nManual), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/\nretal.html (as visited June 20, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (\xc2\xa7704(a) \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the EEOC 1998 Manual, which offers the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s <em>only </em>direct statement on the question of whether the anti-retaliation provision is limited to the same employment-related activity covered by the anti-discrimination provision, answers that question in the negative\xe2\x80\x94directly contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Act.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we do not accept the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s and Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s view that it is \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d to read the statute to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for those whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims of race-based, ethnic-based, religion-based, or gender-based discrimination.  Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Congress has provided similar kinds of protection from retaliation in comparable statutes without any judicial suggestion that those provisions are limited to the conduct prohibited by the primary substantive provisions.  The National Labor Relations Act, to which this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn analogies \xe2\x80\xa6 in other Title VII contexts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hishon</em> v. <em>King &amp; Spalding,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/69/index.html">467 U.

See<em> supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Title VII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of employees who are willing to file complaints and act as witnesses.  \xe2\x80\x9cPlainly, effective enforcement could thus only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/288/index.html">361 U. S. 288</a>, 292 (1960).  Interpreting the anti-retaliation provision to provide broad protection from retaliation helps assure the cooperation upon which accomplishment of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective depends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we conclude that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provision and its anti-retaliation provision are not coterminous.  The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm.  We therefore reject the standards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated the anti-retaliation provision as forbidding the same conduct prohibited by the anti-discrimination provision and that have limited actionable retaliation to so-called \xe2\x80\x9cultimate employment decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.  As we have explained, the Courts of Appeals have used differing language to describe the level of seriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes actionable retaliation.  We agree with the formulation set forth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits.  In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich in this context means it well might have \xe2\x80\x98dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rochon</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1219 (quoting <em>Washington</em>, 420 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 662).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We speak of <em>material</em> adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms.  Title VII, we have said, does not set forth \xe2\x80\x9ca general civility code for the American workplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 80 (1998); see <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual harassment must \xe2\x80\x9cfilter out complaints attacking \xe2\x80\x98the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  An employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.  See 1 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts have held that personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98snubbing\xe2\x80\x99 by supervisors and co-workers\xe2\x80\x9d are not actionable under \xc2\xa7704(a)).  The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered access\xe2\x80\x9d to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial mechanisms.  <em>Robinson</em>, 519 U. S., at 346.  It does so by prohibiting employer actions that are likely \xe2\x80\x9cto deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC,\xe2\x80\x9d the courts, and their employers.  <em>Ibid</em>.  And normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence.  See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \xc2\xa78, p. 8\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We refer to reactions of a <em>reasonable </em>employee because we believe that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s standard for judging harm must be objective.  An objective standard is judicially administrable.  It avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s unusual subjective feelings.  We have emphasized the need for objective standards in other Title VII contexts, and those same concerns animate our decision here.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Suders,</em> 542 U. S., at 141 (constructive discharge doctrine); <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Forklift Systems, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/17/index.html">510 U. S. 17</a>, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We phrase the standard in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.  Context matters.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 81\xe2\x80\x9382.  A schedule change in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Washington, supra, </em>at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child).  A supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to invite an employee to lunch is normally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight.  But to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s professional advancement might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination.  See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \xc2\xa78, p.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.  Hence, a legal standard that speaks in general terms rather than specific prohibited acts is preferable, for an \xe2\x80\x9cact that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 661.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the concurrence, this standard does <em>not</em> require a reviewing court or jury to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  Rather, the standard is tied to the challenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that forms the basis of the Title VII complaint.  By focusing on the materiality of the challenged action and the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s position, we believe this standard will screen out trivial conduct while effectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.    </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we believe that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on White\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim.  See <em>Reeves</em> v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/133/index.html">530 U. S. 133</a>, 150\xe2\x80\x93151 (2000).  The jury found that two of Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s actions amounted to retaliation: the reassignment of White from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks and the 37-day suspension without pay.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Burlington does not question the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the motivation for these acts was retaliatory.  But it does question the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused.  The District Court instructed the jury to determine whether respondent \xe2\x80\x9csuffered a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of her employment,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 63, and the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding based on that same stringent interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision (the interpretation that limits \xc2\xa7704 to the same employment-related conduct forbidden by \xc2\xa7703).  Our holding today makes clear that the jury was not required to find that the challenged actions were related to the terms or conditions of employment.  And insofar as the jury also found that the actions were \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially adverse,\xe2\x80\x9d its findings are adequately supported.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Burlington argues that a reassignment of duties cannot constitute retaliatory discrimination where, as here, both the former and present duties fall within the same job description.  Brief for Petitioner 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  We do not see why that is so.  Almost every job category involves some responsibilities and duties that are less desirable than others.  Common sense suggests that one good way to discourage an employee such as White from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that she spend more time performing the more arduous duties and less time performing those that are easier or more agreeable.  That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently found \xe2\x80\x9c[r]etaliatory work assignments\xe2\x80\x9d to be a classic and \xe2\x80\x9cwidely recognized\xe2\x80\x9d example of \xe2\x80\x9cforbidden retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 EEOC 1991 Manual \xc2\xa7614.7, pp. 614\xe2\x80\x9331 to 614\xe2\x80\x9332; see also 1972 Reference Manual \xc2\xa7495.2 (noting Commission decision involving an employer\xe2\x80\x99s ordering an employee \xe2\x80\x9cto do an unpleasant work assignment in retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d for filing racial discrimination complaint); EEOC Dec. No. 74\xe2\x80\x9377, 1974 WL 3847, *4 (Jan. 18, 1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cEmployers have been enjoined\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cfrom imposing unpleasant work assignments upon an employee for filing charges\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automatically actionable.  Whether a particular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and \xe2\x80\x9cshould be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s position, considering \xe2\x80\x98all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em>, 523 U. S., at 81.  But here, the jury had before it considerable evidence that the track labor duties were \xe2\x80\x9cby all accounts more arduous and dirtier\xe2\x80\x9d; that the \xe2\x80\x9cforklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige\xe2\x80\x9d; and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe forklift operator position was objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented White for occupying it.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 803 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Burlington argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because Burlington ultimately reinstated White with backpay.  Burlington says that \xe2\x80\x9cit defies reason to believe that Congress would have considered a rescinded investigatory suspension with full back pay\xe2\x80\x9d to be unlawful, particularly because Title VII, throughout much of its history, provided no relief in an equitable action for victims in White\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Brief for Petitioner 36.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not find Burlington\xe2\x80\x99s last mentioned reference to the nature of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedies convincing.  After all, throughout its history, Title VII has provided for injunctions to \xe2\x80\x9cbar like discrimination in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U. S. 405</a>, 418 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted), an important form of relief.  Pub. L. 88\xe2\x80\x93352, \xc2\xa7706(g), 78 Stat. 261, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g).  And we have no reason to believe that a court could not have issued an injunction where an employer suspended an employee for retaliatory purposes, even if that employer later provided backpay.  In any event, Congress amended Title VII in 1991 to permit victims of intentional discrimination to recover compensatory (as White received here) and punitive damages, concluding that the additional remedies were necessary to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98help make victims whole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>West</em> v. <em>Gibson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/212/index.html">527 U. S. 212</a>, 219 (1999) (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 1, pp. 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (1991)); see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981a(a)(1), (b).  We would undermine the significance of that congressional judgment were we to conclude that employers could avoid liability in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither do we find convincing any claim of insufficient evidence.  White did receive backpay.  But White and her family had to live for 37 days without income.  They did not know during that time whether or when White could return to work.  Many reasonable employees would find a month without a paycheck to be a serious hardship.  And White described to the jury the physical and emotional hardship that 37 days of having \xe2\x80\x9cno income, no money\xe2\x80\x9d in fact caused.  1 Tr. 154 (\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the worst Christmas I had out of my life.  No income, no money, and that made all of us feel bad. \xe2\x80\xa6 I got very depressed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, she obtained medical treatment for her emotional distress.  A reasonable employee facing the choice between retaining her job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination complaint might well choose the former.  That is to say, an indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent, even if the suspended employee eventually received backpay.  Cf. <em>Mitchell,</em> 361 U. S., at 292 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t needs no argument to show that fear of economic retaliation might often operate to induce aggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the 37-day suspension without pay was materially adverse was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962154">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nBURLINGTON N. &amp; S.

The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation has no basis in the statutory language and will, I fear, lead to practical problems.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two provisions of Title VII are important here.  Section 703(a) prohibits a broad range of discriminatory employment practices.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Among other things, \xc2\xa7703(a) makes it unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9c<em>to discriminate against </em>any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A complementary and closely related provision, \xc2\xa7704(a), makes it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against\xe2\x80\x9d an employee for retaliatory purposes.  Section 704(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to <em>discriminate against</em> any of his employees or applicants for employment \xe2\x80\xa6 because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we must ascertain the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7704(a).  Two possible interpretations are suggested by the language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7703(a) and 704(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first is the interpretation that immediately springs to mind if \xc2\xa7704(a) is read by itself\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7704(a) means what the term literally means, to treat differently.  Respondent staunchly defends this interpretation, which the majority does not embrace, but this interpretation presents problems that are at least sufficient to raise doubts about its correctness.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation makes \xc2\xa7703(a) narrower in scope than \xc2\xa7704(a) and thus implies that the persons whom Title VII is principally designed to protect\xe2\x80\x94victims of discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, or religion\xe2\x80\x94receive less protection than victims of retaliation.  In addition, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a federal case\xe2\x80\x9d out of any small difference in the way an employee who has engaged in protected conduct is treated.  On respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view, a retaliation claim must go to the jury if the employee creates a genuine issue on such questions as whether the employee was given any more or less work than others, was subjected to any more or less supervision, or was treated in a somewhat less friendly manner because of his protected activity.  There is reason to doubt that Congress meant to burden the federal courts with claims involving relatively trivial differences in treatment.  See <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 81 (1998); <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a>, 786\xe2\x80\x93788 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The other plausible interpretation, and the one I favor, reads \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7703(a) and 704(a) together.  Under this reading, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7704(a) means the discriminatory acts reached by \xc2\xa7703(a)\xe2\x80\x94chiefly, discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is not, admittedly, the most straightforward reading of the bare language of \xc2\xa7704(a), but it is a reasonable reading that harmonizes \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7703(a) and 704(a).  It also provides an objective standard that permits insignificant claims to be weeded out at the summary judgment stage, while providing ample protection for employees who are subjected to real retaliation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals that have interpreted \xc2\xa7704(a) in this way state that it requires a materially adverse employment action.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Von Gunten </em>v.<em> Maryland</em>, 243 F. 3d 858, 865 (CA4 2001); <em>Gupta </em>v.<em> Florida Bd. of Regents</em>, 212 F.\xc2\xa03d 571, 587 (CA11 2000), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/1076/index.html">531 U. S. 1076</a> (2001); <em>Robinson </em>v.<em> Pittsburgh</em>, 120 F.\xc2\xa03d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997).  In <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a>, 761\xe2\x80\x93762 (1998), we \xe2\x80\x9cimport[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d this test for use in a different context\xe2\x80\x94to define the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d a concept we used to limit an employer\xe2\x80\x99s liability for harassment carried out by its supervisors.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 761.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not adopt either of the two interpretations noted above.  In Part II\xe2\x80\x93A of its opinion, the majority criticizes the interpretation that harmonizes \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7703(a) and 704(a) as not sufficiently faithful to the language of \xc2\xa7704(a).  Although we found the materially adverse employment action test worthy of \xe2\x80\x9cimport[ation]\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Ellerth</em>, the majority now argues that this test is too narrow because it permits employers to take retaliatory measures outside the workplace.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (citing <em>Rochon </em>v.<em> Gonzales</em>, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1213 (CADC 2006); <em>Berry </em>v.<em> Stevinson Chevrolet</em>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996)).  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s concern is misplaced.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, an employer who wishes to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected conduct is much more likely to do so on the job.  There are far more opportunities for retaliation in that setting, and many forms of retaliation off the job constitute crimes and are therefore especially risky.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the materially adverse employment action test is not limited to on-the-job retaliation, as <em>Rochon</em>, one of the cases cited by the majority, illustrates.  There, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that the Bureau had retaliated against him by failing to provide the off-duty security that would otherwise have been furnished.  See 438 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 1213\xe2\x80\x931214.  But, for an FBI agent whose life may be threatened during off-duty hours, providing security easily qualifies as a term, condition, or privilege of employment.  Certainly, if the FBI had a policy of denying protection to agents of a particular race, such discrimination would be actionable under \xc2\xa7703(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, rather than adopting the more literal interpretation based on the language of \xc2\xa7704(a) alone, the majority instead puts that language aside and adopts a third interpretation\xe2\x80\x94one that has no grounding in the statutory language.  According to the majority, \xc2\xa7704(a) does not reach all retaliatory differences in treatment but only those retaliatory acts that \xe2\x80\x9cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I see no sound basis for this test.  The language of \xc2\xa7704(a), which employs the unadorned term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate,\xe2\x80\x9d does not support this test.  The unstated premise of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning seems to be that \xc2\xa7704(a)\xe2\x80\x99s only purpose is to prevent employers from taking those actions that are likely to stop employees from complaining about discrimination, but this unstated premise is unfounded.  While surely <em>one of the purposes </em>of \xc2\xa7704(a) is to prevent employers from engaging in retaliatory measures that dissuade employees from engaging in protected conduct, there is no reason to suppose that this is \xc2\xa7704(a)\xe2\x80\x99s only purpose.  Indeed, the majority itself identifies another purpose of the antiretaliation provision: \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent harm to individuals\xe2\x80\x9d who assert their rights.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test, however, employer conduct that causes harm to an employee is permitted so long as the employer conduct is not so severe as to dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test leads logically to perverse results.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test, \xc2\xa7704(a) reaches retaliation that well might dissuade an employee from making or supporting \xe2\x80\x9ca charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I take it that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>a</em> charge of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d means the particular charge that the employee in question filed,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and if that is the proper interpretation, the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge must be taken into account in applying \xc2\xa7704(a).  Specifically, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation logically implies that the degree of protection afforded to a victim of retaliation is inversely proportional to the severity of the original act of discrimination that prompted the retaliation.  A reasonable employee who is subjected to the most severe discrimination will not easily be dissuaded from filing a charge by the threat of retaliation; the costs of filing the charge, including possible retaliation, will have to be great to outweigh the benefits, such as preventing the continuation of the discrimination in the future and obtaining damages and other relief for past discrimination.  Because the possibility of relatively severe retaliation will not easily dissuade this employee, the employer will be able to engage in relatively severe retaliation without incurring liability under \xc2\xa7704(a).  On the other hand, an employee who is subjected to a much milder form of discrimination will be much more easily dissuaded.  For this employee, the costs of complaining, including possible retaliation, will not have to be great to outweigh the lesser benefits that might be obtained by filing a charge.  These topsy-turvy results make no sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conception of a reasonable worker is unclear.  Although the majority first states that its test is whether a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable worker\xe2\x80\x9d might well be dissuaded, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it later suggests that at least some individual characteristics of the actual retaliation victim must be taken into account.  The majority comments that \xe2\x80\x9cthe significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d and provides the following illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cA schedule change in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This illustration suggests that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test is not whether an act of retaliation well might dissuade the average reasonable worker, putting aside all individual characteristics, but, rather, whether the act well might dissuade a reasonable worker who shares at least some individual characteristics with the actual victim.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s illustration introduces three individual characteristics: age, gender, and family responsibilities.  How many more individual characteristics a court or jury may or must consider is unclear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation contains a loose and unfamiliar causation standard.  As noted, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test asks whether an employer\xe2\x80\x99s retaliatory act \xe2\x80\x9c<em>well might have dissuaded</em> a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  Especially in an area of the law in which standards of causation are already complex, the introduction of this new and unclear standard is unwelcome.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test but would hold that \xc2\xa7704(a) reaches only those discriminatory practices covered by \xc2\xa7703(a).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this interpretation, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.  The actions taken against respondent\xe2\x80\x94her assignment to new and substantially less desirable duties and her suspension without pay\xe2\x80\x94fall within<em> </em>the definition of an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reassignment, <em>Ellerth </em>specifically identified a \xe2\x80\x9creassignment with significantly different responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  524 U. S., at 761.  Here, as the Court of Appeals stated, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n essence, \xe2\x80\xa6 the reassignment was a demotion.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d 789, 803 (CA6 2004).  The \xe2\x80\x9cnew position was by all accounts more arduous and \xe2\x80\x98dirtier,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sole stated rationale for the reassignment was that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior duties were better suited for someone with greater seniority.  This was virtually an admission that respondent was demoted when those responsibilities were taken away from her.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would hold that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suspension without pay likewise satisfied the materially adverse employment action test.  Accordingly, although I would hold that a plaintiff asserting a \xc2\xa7704(a) retaliation claim must show the same type of materially adverse employment action that is required for a \xc2\xa7703(a) discrimination claim, I would hold that petitioner met that standard in this case, and I, therefore, concur in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 703(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or <em>otherwise to discriminate against</em> any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

Without gauging the severity of the initial alleged discrimination, a jury cannot possibly compare the costs and benefits of filing a charge and, thus, cannot possibly decide whether the employer\xe2\x80\x99s alleged retaliatory conduct is severe enough to dissuade the filing of a charge.  A jury will have no way of assessing the severity of the average alleged act of discrimination that leads to the filing of a charge, and, therefore, if \xe2\x80\x9ca charge\xe2\x80\x9d means an average or generic charge, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s test will leave juries hopelessly at sea.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
