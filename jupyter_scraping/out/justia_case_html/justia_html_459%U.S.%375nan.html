The first is whether purchasers of registered securities who allege they were defrauded by misrepresentations in a registration statement may maintain an action under \xc2\xa7 10(b) notwithstanding the express remedy for misstatements and omissions in registration statements provided by \xc2\xa7 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 48 Stat. 82, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77k.

(TIS), filed a registration statement and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission offering a total of $4,398,900 in securities to the public.  The proceeds of the sale were to be used to finance the construction of an automobile speedway.  The entire issue was sold on the offering date, October 30, 1969.  TIS did not meet with success, however, and the corporation filed a petition for bankruptcy on November 30, 1970. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 459 U. S. 378</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1972, plaintiffs Huddleston and Bradley instituted a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of TIS securities.  The complaint alleged violations of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.10b-5 (1982). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Plaintiffs sued most of the participants in the offering, including the accounting firm, Herman &amp; MacLean, which had issued an opinion concerning certain financial statements and a <em>pro forma</em> balance sheet [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] that were contained in the registration statement and prospectus.  Plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misrepresent or conceal material facts regarding the financial condition of TIS, including the costs incurred in building the speedway.  After a 3-week trial, the District Judge submitted the case to the jury on special interrogatories relating to liability.  The judge instructed the jury that liability could be found only if the defendants acted with scienter. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The judge also instructed the jury to determine whether plaintiffs had proved their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 459 U. S. 379</a></p><p> After the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the submitted issues, the judge concluded that Herman &amp; MacLean and others had violated \xc2\xa7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by making fraudulent misrepresentations in the TIS registration statement. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The court then determined the amount of damages and entered judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a cause of action may be maintained under \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act for fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions even when that conduct might also be actionable under \xc2\xa7 11 of the 1933 Act.  640 F.2d 534, 540-543 (1981).  However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court as to the appropriate standard of proof for an action under \xc2\xa7 10(b), concluding that a plaintiff must prove his case by "clear and convincing" evidence.  <em>Id.</em> at 545-546.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s judgment on other grounds and remanded the case for a new trial.  <em>Id.</em> at 547-550, 560.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider whether an implied cause of action under \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act will lie for conduct subject to an express civil remedy under the 1933 Act, an issue we have previously reserved, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and to decide the standard of proof applicable to actions under \xc2\xa7 10(b).

We now affirm the Court of Appeals\' holding that plaintiffs could maintain an action under \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act, but we reverse as to the applicable standard of proof.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Securities Act of 1933 and the 1934 Act "constitute interrelated components of the federal regulatory scheme governing transactions in securities."  <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html">425 U. S. 185</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html#206">425 U. S. 206</a></span> (1976).  The Acts created several express private rights of action, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] one of which is contained in \xc2\xa7 11 of the 1933 Act.  In addition to the private actions created explicitly by the 1933 and 1934 Acts, federal courts have implied private remedies under other provisions of the two laws. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Most significantly for present purposes, a private right of action under \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 has been consistently recognized for more than 35 years. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The existence of this implied remedy is simply beyond peradventure. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 459 U. S. 381</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The issue in this case is whether a party should be barred from invoking this established remedy for fraud because the allegedly fraudulent conduct would apparently also provide the basis for a damages action under \xc2\xa7 11 of the 1933 Act. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The resolution of this issue turns on the fact that the two provisions involve distinct causes of action, and were intended to address different types of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Section 11 of the 1933 Act allows purchasers of a registered security to sue certain enumerated parties in a registered offering when false or misleading information is included in a registration statement.  The section was designed to assure compliance with the disclosure provisions of the Act by imposing a stringent standard of liability [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] on the parties who </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 459 U. S. 382</a></p><p> play a direct role in a registered offering. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  If a plaintiff purchased a security issued pursuant to a registration statement, he need only show a material misstatement or omission to establish his <em>prima facie</em> case. Liability against the issuer of a security is virtually absolute, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] even for innocent misstatements.  Other defendants bear the burden of demonstrating due diligence.  <em>See</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77k(b).</p>\n<p>Although limited in scope, \xc2\xa7 11 places a relatively minimal burden on a plaintiff.  In contrast, \xc2\xa7 10(b) is a "catch-all" antifraud provision, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] but it requires a plaintiff to carry a heavier burden to establish a cause of action.  While a \xc2\xa7 11 action must be brought by a purchaser of a registered security, must be based on misstatements or omissions in a registration statement, and can only be brought against certain parties, a \xc2\xa7 10(b) action can be brought by a purchaser or seller of "<em>any</em> security" against "<em>any</em> person" who has used "<em>any</em> manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance" in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78j (emphasis added).  However, a \xc2\xa7 10(b) plaintiff carries a heavier burden than a \xc2\xa7 11 plaintiff.  Most significantly, he must prove that the defendant acted with scienter, <em>i.e.,</em> with intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Since \xc2\xa7 11 and \xc2\xa7 10(b) address different types of wrongdoing, we see no reason to carve out an exception to \xc2\xa7 10(b) for fraud occurring in a registration statement just because the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 459 U. S. 383</a></p><p> same conduct may also be actionable under \xc2\xa7 11. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Exempting such conduct from liability under \xc2\xa7 10(b) would conflict with the basic purpose of the 1933 Act:  to provide greater protection to purchasers of registered securities.  It would be anomalous indeed if the special protection afforded to purchasers in a registered offering by the 1933 Act were deemed to deprive such purchasers of the protections against manipulation and deception that \xc2\xa7 10(b) makes available to all persons who deal in securities.</p>\n<p>While some conduct actionable under \xc2\xa7 11 may also be actionable under \xc2\xa7 10(b), it is hardly a novel proposition that the 1934 Act and the 1933 Act "prohibit some of the same conduct."  <em>United State v. Naftalin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/768/case.html">441 U. S. 768</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/768/case.html#778">441 U. S. 778</a></span> (1979) (applying \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the 1933 Act to conduct also prohibited by \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the 1934 Act in an action by the SEC).  "<em>The fact that there may well be some overlap is neither unusual nor unfortunate.\'"  <em>Ibid.,</em> quoting <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/453/case.html">393 U.

In saving clauses included in the 1933 and 1934 Acts, Congress rejected the notion that the express remedies of the securities laws would preempt all other rights of action.  Section 16 of the 1933 Act states unequivocally that "[t]he rights and remedies provided by this title shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77p.  Section 28(a) of the 1934 Act contains a parallel provision.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78bb(a).  These provisions confirm that the remedies in each Act were to be supplemented by "any and all" additional remedies.\n</em></p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by our reasoning in <em>Ernst  Ernst v. Hochfelder,</em> which held that actions under \xc2\xa7 10(b) require proof of scienter, and do not encompass negligent conduct.  In so holding, we noted that each of the express civil </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 459 U. S. 384</a></p><p> remedies in the 1933 Act allowing recovery for negligent conduct is subject to procedural restrictions not applicable to a \xc2\xa7 10(b) action. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html#208">425 U. S. 208</a></span>-210.  We emphasized that extension of \xc2\xa7 10(b) to negligent conduct would have allowed causes of action for negligence under the express remedies to be brought instead under \xc2\xa7 10(b), "thereby nullify[ing] the effectiveness of the carefully drawn procedural restrictions on these express actions."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html#210">425 U. S. 210</a></span> (footnote omitted).  In reasoning that scienter should be required in \xc2\xa7 10(b) actions in order to avoid circumvention of the procedural restrictions surrounding the express remedies, we necessarily assumed that the express remedies were not exclusive.  Otherwise there would have been no danger of nullification.  Conversely, because the added burden of proving scienter attaches to suits under \xc2\xa7 10(b), invocation of the \xc2\xa7 10(b) remedy will not "nullify" the procedural restrictions that apply to the express remedies. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>This cumulative construction of the remedies under the 1933 and 1934 Acts is also supported by the fact that, when Congress comprehensively revised the securities laws in 1975, a consistent line of judicial decisions had permitted plaintiffs to sue under \xc2\xa7 10(b) regardless of the availability of express remedies.  In 1975, Congress enacted the</p>\n<p>"most substantial and significant revision of this country\'s Federal securities laws since the passage of the Securities Exchange </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 459 U. S. 385</a></p><p> Act in 1934. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub.L. 94-29, 89 Stat. 97.  When Congress acted, federal courts had consistently and routinely permitted a plaintiff to proceed under \xc2\xa7 10(b) even where express remedies under \xc2\xa7 11 or other provisions were available. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  In light of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 459 U. S. 386</a></p><p> well-established judicial interpretation, Congress\' decision to leave \xc2\xa7 10(b) intact suggests that Congress ratified the cumulative nature of the \xc2\xa7 10(b) action.  <em>See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v.

In enacting the 1934 Act, Congress stated that its purpose was "to impose requirements necessary to make [securities] regulation and control reasonably complete and effective."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78b.  In furtherance of that objective, \xc2\xa7 10(b) makes it unlawful to use "any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance" in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.  The effectiveness of the broad proscription against fraud in \xc2\xa7 10(b) would be undermined if its scope were restricted by the existence of an express remedy under \xc2\xa7 11.

[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that plaintiffs in a \xc2\xa7 10(b) suit must establish their case by clear and convincing evidence.  The Court of Appeals relied primarily on the traditional use of a higher burden of proof in civil fraud actions at common law.  640 F.2d at 545-546.  Reference to common law practices can be misleading, however, since the historical considerations underlying the imposition of a higher standard of proof have questionable pertinence here. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  <em>See Blue Chip Stamp v. Manor Drug Stores,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html">421 U.

Moreover, the antifraud provisions of the securities laws are not coextensive with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 459 U. S. 389</a></p><p> common law doctrines of fraud. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Indeed, an important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived deficiencies in the available common law protections by establishing higher standards of conduct in the securities industry.  <em>See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/182/case.html#186">385 U. S. 186</a></span>.  We therefore find reference to the common law in this instance unavailing.</p>\n<p>Where Congress has not prescribed the appropriate standard of proof and the Constitution does not dictate a particular standard, we must prescribe one.  <em>See Steadman v. SEC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html">450 U. S. 91</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html#95">450 U.

In doing so, we are mindful that a standard of proof "serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision."  <em>Addington v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html">441 U. S. 418</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#423">441 U.

Thus, we have required proof by clear and convincing evidence where particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake.  <em>See, e.g.,Santosky v. Kramer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html">455 U. S. 745</a></span> (1982) (proceeding to terminate parental rights); <em>Addington v.

[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  By contrast, imposition of even severe civil sanctions that do not implicate such interests has been permitted after proof by a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 459 U. S. 390</a></p><p> preponderance of the evidence.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Regan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/37/case.html">232 U.

S. 48</a></span>-49 (1914) (proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices in civil suits involving proof of acts that expose a party to a criminal prosecution).  Thus, in interpreting a statutory provision in <em>Steadman v. SEC, supra,</em> we upheld use of the preponderance standard in SEC administrative proceedings concerning alleged violations of the antifraud provisions.  The sanctions imposed in the proceedings included an order permanently barring an individual from practicing his profession.  And in <em>SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp.,</em> 320 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/344/case.html#355">320 U. S. 355</a></span>, we held that a preponderance of the evidence suffices to establish fraud under \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the 1933 Act.</p>\n<p>A preponderance of the evidence standard allows both parties to "share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion."  <em>Addington v. Texas, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#423">441 U. S. 423</a></span>.  Any other standard expresses a preference for one side\'s interests.  The balance of interests in this case warrants use of the preponderance standard.  On the one hand, the defendants face the risk of opprobrium that may result from a finding of fraudulent conduct, but this risk is identical to that in an action under \xc2\xa7 17(a), which is governed by the preponderance of the evidence standard.  The interests of defendants in a securities case do not differ qualitatively from the interests of defendants sued for violations of other federal statutes such as the antitrust or civil rights laws, for which proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices.  On the other hand, the interests of plaintiffs in such suits are significant.  Defrauded investors are among the very individuals Congress sought to protect in the securities laws.  If they prove that it is more likely than not that they were defrauded, they should recover.</p>\n<p>We therefore decline to depart from the preponderance of the evidence standard generally applicable in civil actions.

When the question whether an implied cause of action can be brought under \xc2\xa7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 was first considered in this Court, we confirmed the existence of such a cause of action without extended discussion.  <em>See Superintendent of Insurance v.

Nixon,</em> 429 F.2d 348, 355 (CA10 1970) (recognizing overlapping actions but resolving conflict in favor of express remedy where that remedy is "explicit").  Two early District Court decisions had refused to recognize an action under Rule 10b-5 in the face of overlap with \xc2\xa7 11.  <em>Rosenberg v. Globe Aircraft Corp.,</em> 80 F.Supp. 123 (ED Pa.1948); <em>Montague v. Electronic Corp. of America,</em> 76 F.Supp. 933 (SDNY 1948).  The latter case was not subsequently followed in the Southern District, <em>e.g., Osborne v. Mallory,</em> 86 F.Supp. 869 (SDNY 1949), and it has no precedential value in light of the Second Circuit\'s decision in <em>Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., supra.</em>  The <em>Rosenberg</em> decision stood alone at the time of the 1975 Amendments, and even that decision had not been followed in the District in which it was decided, <em>Premier Industries, Inc. v. Delaware Valley Financial Corp.,</em> 185 F.Supp. 694 (ED Pa.1960), or elsewhere within the same Circuit, <em>Dauphin Corp. v. Redwall Corp.,</em> 201 F.Supp. 466 (Del.1962).  Since the 1975 Amendments, the lower courts have continued to recognize that an implied cause of action under \xc2\xa7 10(b) can be brought regardless of whether express remedies are available.  <em>See, e.g., Berger v. Bishop Investment Corp.,</em> 695 F.2d 302 (CA8 1982); <em>Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

These include corporate officers other than those specified in 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77k(a), lawyers not acting as "experts," and accountant with respect to parts of a registration statement which they are not named as having prepared or certified.  If, as Herman &amp; MacLean argues, purchasers in registered offerings were required to rely solely on \xc2\xa7 11, they would have no recourse against such individuals even if the excluded parties engaged in fraudulent conduct while participating in the registration statement.  The exempted individuals would be immune from federal liability for fraudulent conduct even though \xc2\xa7 10(b) extends to "any person" who engages in fraud in connection with a purchase or sale of securities.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>We also reject application of the maxim of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</em> <em>See</em> H.

Concerned that claims would be fabricated, the chancery courts imposed a more demanding standard of proof.
