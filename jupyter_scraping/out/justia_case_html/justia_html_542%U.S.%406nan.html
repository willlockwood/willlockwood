S. 367</a>, and <em>McKoy</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/433/index.html">494 U. S. 433</a>, in which it held invalid capital sentencing schemes requiring juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously.  After respondent\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction <em>Mills</em> claim was rejected by the State Supreme Court on the merits, he turned to the federal courts.  Ultimately, the Third Circuit applied the analytical framework set forth in <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a>, under which federal habeas petitioners may not avail themselves of new rules of constitutional criminal procedure outside two narrow exceptions; concluded that <em>Mills </em>did not announce a new rule and therefore could be applied retroactively; and granted respondent relief.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because <em>Mills</em> announced a new rule of constitutional criminal procedure that does not fall within either <em>Teague</em> exception, its rule cannot be applied retroactively.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Teague</em> analysis involves a three-step process requiring a court to determine when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final; whether, given the legal landscape at the time the conviction became final, the rule sought to be applied is actually new; and, if so, whether it falls within either of two exceptions to nonretroactivity.  P.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final before <em>Mills</em> was decided.  The normal rule for determining a state conviction\xe2\x80\x99s finality for retroactivity review\xe2\x80\x94when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a certiorari petition has elapsed or a timely petition has been finally denied\xe2\x80\x94applies here.  That the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the merits of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Mills</em> claim on collateral review does change his conviction\xe2\x80\x99s finality to a date subsequent to <em>Mills</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Mills</em> announced a new rule.  In reaching its conclusion in <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy</em>, this Court relied on a line of cases beginning with <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a>.  <em>Lockett</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general rule that the sentencer must be allowed to consider any mitigating evidence could be thought to support the conclusion in <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy </em>that<em> </em>capital sentencing schemes cannot require juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously<em>,</em> but it did not mandate the <em>Mills</em> rule.  Each of the cases relied on by <em>Mills</em> (and <em>McKoy</em>) considered only obstructions to the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider mitigating evidence.  <em>Mills\xe2\x80\x99 </em>innovation rests with its shift in focus to individual jurors.  Moreover, there is no need to guess whether reasonable jurists could have differed as to whether the <em>Lockett</em> line of cases compelled <em>Mills.  </em>Four dissenting Justices in <em>Mills</em> reasoned that because nothing prevented the jury from hearing the mitigating evidence, <em>Lockett</em> did not control; and three dissenting Justices in <em>McKoy</em> concluded that <em>Lockett</em> did not remotely support the new focus on individual jurors.  Because the <em>Mills</em> rule broke new ground, it applies to respondent on collateral review only if it falls under a <em>Teague</em> exception.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The <em>Mills</em> rule does not fall within either exception.  There is no argument that the first exception applies here.  And this Court has repeatedly emphasized the limited scope of the second exception\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/151/index.html">521 U.

In providing guidance as to what might do so, the Court has repeatedly, and only, referred to the right-to-counsel rule of <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a>, which \xe2\x80\x9caltered [the Court\xe2\x80\x99s] understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements</em> essential to the fairness of a proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sawyer</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/227/index.html">497 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <em>supra.  </em>While <em>Mills </em>and<em> McKoy</em> were decided to avoid potentially arbitrary impositions of the death sentence, the <em>Mills </em>rule has \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in <em>Gideon,\xe2\x80\x9d Saffle</em> v. <em>Parks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/index.html">494 U.

S. 433</a> (1990), this Court held invalid capital sentencing schemes that require juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously.  In this case, we must determine whether the rule announced in <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy</em> can be applied on federal habeas corpus review to a defendant whose conviction became final in 1987.  Under our retroactivity analysis as set forth in <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/288/index.html">489 U.

We conclude that <em>Mills</em> announced a new rule that does not fall within either of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More than 20 years ago, a jury convicted respondent, George Banks, of 12 counts of first-degree murder, and the trial court sentenced him to death.  The facts of this case are set forth in detail in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision affirming respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence on direct review.  See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, 513 Pa. 318, 521 A.\xc2\xa02d 1 (1987).  Direct review ended when this Court denied certiorari on October 5, 1987.  <em>Banks</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/873/index.html">484 U. S. 873</a>.  Approximately eight months later, this Court handed down its decision in <em>Mills</em>, <em>supra, </em>which announced that the Constitution forbids States from imposing a requirement that the jury find a potential mitigating factor unanimously before that factor may be considered in the sentencing decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent pursued state postconviction relief on the theory that the instructions and verdict form given to the jury in his case violated the <em>Mills</em> principle, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected this claim on the merits.  See <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, 540 Pa. 143, 656 A.\xc2\xa02d 467 (1995).  Respondent then turned to the federal courts.  Although the District Court denied relief, <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>63 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 525 (MD Pa. 1999), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence, <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>271 F.\xc2\xa03d 527 (2001).  In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals declined to apply the retroactivity analysis set forth in <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane, supra</em>, to the question whether <em>Mills</em> applied retroactively to respondent.  This was not necessary, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had itself applied <em>Mills</em>.  271 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 543.  We summarily reversed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to performing any analysis required by AEDPA, a federal court considering a habeas petition must conduct a threshold <em>Teague</em> analysis when the issue is properly raised by the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Horn</em> v. <em>Banks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/266/index.html">536 U. S. 266</a>, 272 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em> <em>(Banks I)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Court of Appeals considered the retroactive application of <em>Mills</em>.  <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>316 F.\xc2\xa03d 228 (CA3 2003).  The court recognized that its primary task was to determine whether <em>Mills</em> announced a new rule, and that this, in turn, required it to ascertain whether the precedent existing at the time respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final dictated or compelled the rule in <em>Mills</em>.  316 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 233\xe2\x80\x93235.  From this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/586/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a> (1978), <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a> (1982), and their direct progeny, the Court of Appeals distilled the rule that the \xe2\x80\x9cEighth Amendment prohibits any barrier to the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 239.  The Court of Appeals characterized this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Mills</em> as \xe2\x80\x9cmerely recogniz[ing] that the perceived need for unanimity could constitute one such unconstitutional barrier,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that the existing legal landscape compelled the decision in <em>Mills</em>.  316 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 240.  Accordingly, the court held that <em>Mills</em> applied retroactively to respondent and reinstated the remainder of its previous opinion, again granting respondent relief from his death sentence.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s second petition for certiorari in this case to decide whether <em>Mills</em> applies retroactively to respondent and, if so, whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unreasonably applied federal law in holding that there was no <em>Mills</em> error in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/987/index.html">539 U. S. 987</a> (2003).  Although the <em>Lockett</em>/<em>Eddings</em> line of cases supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Mills</em>, it does not compel that decision.  <em>Mills</em> therefore announced a new rule.  We are also unable to conclude that the <em>Mills</em> rule falls under either <em>Teague</em> exception.  In particular, <em>Mills</em> did not announce a \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saffle</em> v. <em>Parks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/484/index.html">494 U. S. 484</a>, 495 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, we again reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Teague</em>, the determination whether a constitutional rule of criminal procedure applies to a case on collateral review involves a three-step process.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lambrix</em> v. <em>Singletary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/518/index.html">520 U. S. 518</a>, 527 (1997).  First, the court must determine when the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final.  Second, it must ascertain the \xe2\x80\x9clegal landscape as it then existed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graham</em> v.<em> Collins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/461/index.html">506 U. S. 461</a>, 468 (1993), and ask whether the Constitution, as interpreted by the precedent then existing, compels the rule.  <em>Saffle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 488.  That is, the court must decide whether the rule is actually \xe2\x80\x9cnew.\xe2\x80\x9d  Finally, if the rule is new, the court must consider whether it falls within either of the two exceptions to nonretroactivity.  <em>Lambrix</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 527.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ordinarily, ascertaining the date on which a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction becomes final poses no difficulties: State convictions are final \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of retroactivity analysis when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Caspari</em> v. <em>Bohlen,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/383/index.html">510 U.

He argues that, in view of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s unique \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed waiver rule\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94pursuant to which that court considered his <em>Mills</em> claim on the merits\xe2\x80\x94his conviction became final for <em>Teague</em> purposes in 1995 when the State Supreme Court decided the <em>Mills</em> claim against him.  Brief for Respondent 25\xe2\x80\x9331.  Because of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice of considering forfeited claims in capital cases, respondent insists, \xe2\x80\x9cconventional notions of \xe2\x80\x98finality,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d do not apply.  <em>Id.,</em> at 27.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the past, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did, in fact, apply a \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed waiver rule\xe2\x80\x9d in death penalty cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>DeHart</em>, 539 Pa. 5, 25, 650 A.\xc2\xa02d 38, 48 (1994); <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Billa</em>, 521 Pa. 168, 181, 555 A.\xc2\xa02d 835, 842 (1989).  But this practice, which the court has abandoned, see <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Albretcht</em>, 554 Pa. 31, 44\xe2\x80\x9346, 720 A.\xc2\xa02d 693, 700 (1999), \xe2\x80\x9cwas not absolute, but discretionary,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, 573 Pa. 532, 557, n.\xc2\xa09, 827 A.\xc2\xa02d 385, 400, n.\xc2\xa09 (2003) (describing past practice).  Notably, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has expressly stated, in a capital case, that it would decline to apply <em>Mills</em> retroactively.  <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Peterkin</em>, 538 Pa. 455, 465, n.\xc2\xa04, 649 A.\xc2\xa02d 121, 126, n.\xc2\xa04 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A state court\xe2\x80\x99s past discretionary \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98practice\xe2\x80\x99 [of] declin[ing] to apply ordinary waiver principles in capital cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Albretcht</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 44, 720 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 700, does not render convictions and sentences that are no longer subject to direct review nonfinal for <em>Teague</em> purposes.  Such a judgment is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d despite the possibility that a state court might, in its discretion, decline to enforce an available procedural bar and choose to apply a new rule of law.  Cf. <em>Wainwright</em> v. <em>Sykes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/72/index.html">433 U. S. 72</a>, 81\xe2\x80\x9391 (1977).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of <em>Teague</em>.  <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s nonretroactivity principle acts as a limitation on the power of federal courts to grant \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus relief to \xe2\x80\xa6 state prisoner[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Caspari</em>, 510 U. S., at 389.  That is why federal habeas corpus courts \xe2\x80\x9c<em>must</em> apply <em>Teague</em> before considering the merits of [a] claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, whenever <em>the State</em> raises the question, a point we explained in <em>Banks I</em>, see 536 U. S., at 271.  See also <em>id.,</em> at 271\xe2\x80\x93272 (explaining that the Court of Appeals had erred by focusing only on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Mills</em> claim).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This should make clear that the <em>Teague</em> principle protects not only the reasonable judgments of state courts but also the States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in finality quite apart from their courts.  As <em>Teague</em> explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways the application of new rules to cases on collateral review may be more intrusive than the enjoining of criminal prosecutions, cf. <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a>, 43\xe2\x80\x9354 (1971), for it <em>continually</em> forces the States to marshal resources in order to keep in prison defendants whose trials and appeals conformed to then-existing constitutional standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 310.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn short, our rule for determining when a state conviction becomes final applies to this case without modification, and we agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final in 1987.

In <em>Mills</em>, the Court held that the Constitution prohibits States from requiring jurors to find mitigating factors unanimously.  <em>McKoy</em>, 494 U. S., at 444; <em>Mills</em>, 486 U. S., at 374\xe2\x80\x93375; <em>id.,</em> at 384 (vacating death sentence because the jury instructions gave rise to a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial probability that reasonable jurors \xe2\x80\xa6 may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d not found unanimously).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching its conclusion, the Court in <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy</em> relied on a line of cases beginning with <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/586/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/586/index.html">438 U.

S. 104</a> (1982).  In <em>Lockett</em>, a plurality of the Court struck down Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty statute because it prevented the sentencer from \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering, <em>as a mitigating factor</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9caspect[s] of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record and [certain] circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffer[ed] as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  438 U. S., at 604.  A majority of the Court first embraced this principle in <em>Eddings</em>.  There, the Court confronted a situation in which the sentencer had found, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>as a matter of law</em> [that it] was unable even to consider [potentially mitigating] evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  455 U. S., at 113.  The Court held that this limitation violated the <em>Lockett</em> rule.  <em>Id.,</em> at 113\xe2\x80\x93115.  See also <em>Skipper</em> v. <em>South Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/index.html">476 U. S. 1</a>, 4, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1986) (holding that States cannot, through evidentiary rules, exclude relevant mitigating evidence from the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Mills</em>, the Court noted that its previous cases did not depend on the source of the potential barrier to the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider mitigating evidence.  486 U. S., at 375.  The Court then asserted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he same [rule must apply] with respect to a single juror\xe2\x80\x99s holdout vote against finding the presence of a mitigating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>McKoy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 441\xe2\x80\x93443 (quoting <em>Mills</em> and performing the same analysis).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The generalized <em>Lockett</em> rule (that the sentencer must be allowed to consider any mitigating evidence) could be thought to support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy</em>.  But what is essential here is that it does not mandate the <em>Mills</em> rule.  Each of the cases relied on by <em>Mills</em> (and <em>McKoy</em>) specifically considered only obstructions to the <em>sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s</em> ability to consider mitigating evidence.  <em>Mills</em>\xe2\x80\x99 innovation rests with its shift in focus to individual jurors.  We think it clear that reasonable jurists could have differed as to whether the <em>Lockett</em> principle compelled <em>Mills</em>.  See <em>Lambrix</em>, 520 U. S., at 527\xe2\x80\x93528.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there is no need to guess.  In <em>Mills</em>, four justices dissented, reasoning that because nothing prevented the jurors from hearing any mitigating evidence that the defendant proffered, the <em>Lockett</em> principle did not control.  486 U. S., at 394 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  In <em>McKoy</em>, three justices dissented, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the principle established in <em>Lockett</em>\xe2\x80\x99 does not remotely support\xe2\x80\x9d the new focus on individual jurors.  494 U. S., at 464 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see <em>id.,</em> at 466 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> are quite simply irrelevant to the question before us \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 452\xe2\x80\x93453 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that the Court \xe2\x80\x9cstretche[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the <em>Lockett</em> cases \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond their proper bounds\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent in <em>McKoy</em> stressed the Court\xe2\x80\x99s move from jury to juror.  See 494 U. S., at 465\xe2\x80\x93466 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Indeed, prior to <em>Mills</em>, <em>none</em> of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s relevant cases addressed individual jurors, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hitchcock</em> v. <em>Dugger,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/393/index.html">481 U. S. 393</a> (1987), a trend that continued even after <em>Mills</em>, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Saffle</em> v. <em>Parks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/484/index.html">494 U. S. 484</a> (1990); <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/302/index.html">492 U.

S. 164</a> (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>McKoy</em> dissent also explained that the <em>Mills</em> rule governs how the sentencer considers evidence, not what evidence it considers.  In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, the <em>Lockett</em> line governed the latter but not the former.  See 494 U. S., at 465\xe2\x80\x93466 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  For this distinction, the dissent relied on <em>Saffle</em> v. <em>Parks</em>, <em>supra</em>, decided the same day.  There, the Court held that the <em>Lockett</em> line of cases did not compel (assuming it informed) the sought-for rule that States may not \xe2\x80\x9cinstruct the sentencer to render its decision on the evidence without sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 490.  The Court observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cParks asks us to create a rule relating, not to <em>what</em> mitigating evidence the jury must be permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision, but to <em>how</em> it must consider the mitigating evidence.  There is a simple and logical difference between rules that govern what factors the jury must be permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision and rules that govern how the State may guide the jury in considering and weighing those factors in reaching a decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThus, although the Lockett</em> principle\xe2\x80\x94conceived of at a high level of generality\xe2\x80\x94could be thought to support the <em>Mills</em> rule, reasonable jurists differed even as to this point.  It follows <em>a fortiori</em> that reasonable jurists could have concluded that the <em>Lockett</em> line of cases did not compel <em>Mills</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Given the brand new attention <em>Mills</em> paid to individual jurors and the relevance of the what/how distinction drawn in <em>Saffle</em> (which again distinguishes <em>Mills</em> from the <em>Lockett</em> line), we must conclude that the <em>Mills</em> rule \xe2\x80\x9cbr[o]k[e] new ground,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Teague</em>, 489 U. S., at 301.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Accordingly, <em>Mills</em> announced a new rule, which does not apply to respondent on collateral review, unless, of course, it falls under one of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s bar on retroactive application of new rules of constitutional criminal procedure has two exceptions.  First, the bar does not apply to rules forbidding punishment \xe2\x80\x9cof certain primary conduct [or to] rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Penry</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 330; see also <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/151/index.html">521 U. S. 151</a>, 157 (1997).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  There is no argument that this exception applies here.  The second exception is for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Graham</em>, 506 U. S., at 478).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have repeatedly emphasized the limited scope of the second <em>Teague</em> exception, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that \xe2\x80\xa6 are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 157 (quoting <em>Graham</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 478).  And, because any qualifying rule \xe2\x80\x9cwould be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt [that it is] unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graham</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 478 (quoting <em>Teague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 313), it should come as no surprise that we have yet to find a new rule that falls under the second <em>Teague</em> exception.  Perhaps for this reason, respondent does not even attempt to argue that <em>Mills</em> qualifies or to rebut petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that it does not, Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In providing guidance as to what might fall within this exception, we have repeatedly referred to the rule of <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html"></a><a href="/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a> (1963) (right to counsel), and only to this rule.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Saffle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495; cf. <em>Gilmore</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/333/index.html">508 U. S. 333</a>, 364 (1993) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  <em>Gideon</em> overruled <em>Betts</em> v. <em>Brady,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/455/index.html">316 U.

The Court continued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in an orderly society.  Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their defenses.  That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries.  <em>The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours.  From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law.  This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>id.,</em> at 344\xe2\x80\x93345 (quoting <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/index.html">287 U. S. 45</a>, 68\xe2\x80\x9369 (1932)).  <em>Gideon</em>, it is fair to say, \xe2\x80\x9calter[ed] our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements</em> essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sawyer</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/227/index.html">497 U.

In <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em> v. <em>Netherland</em>, <em>supra</em>, for example, we considered the retroactivity of the rule announced in <em>Simmons</em> v. <em>South Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/154/index.html">512 U. S. 154</a> (1994).  <em>Simmons</em> held that a capital defendant must be allowed to inform the sentencer that he would be ineligible for parole if the prosecution argues future dangerousness.  We rejected the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the <em>Simmons</em> rule was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on par\xe2\x80\x99 with <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html"></a><a href="/us/372/335/index.html">372 U.

S. 320</a>, 323 (1985) (holding that the Eighth Amendment bars imposition of the death penalty by a jury that had been led to believe that responsibility for the ultimate decision rested elsewhere).  There too we declined to give retroactive effect to a rule that effectively withheld relevant information from the sentencer.  See <em>Sawyer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 242\xe2\x80\x93245.  We acknowledged that the <em>Caldwell</em> rule was intended to enhance \xe2\x80\x9cthe accuracy of capital sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  497 U. S., at 244.  But because it affected an incremental change, we could not conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthis systemic rule enhancing reliability is an \xe2\x80\x98absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Teague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 314).  See also <em>Graham</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 478 (concluding that the rule announced in <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/302/index.html">492 U.

Eleven of 12 jurors, could, for example, agree that six mitigating circumstances existed, but one holdout juror could nevertheless force the death sentence.  Similarly, all 12 jurors could agree that some mitigating circumstances existed and that these outweighed any aggravators, but because they did not agree on which mitigating circumstances were present, they would again have to return a death sentence.  See <em>Mills</em>, 486 U. S., at 373\xe2\x80\x93374; see\nalso <em>McKoy</em>, 494 U. S., at 439\xe2\x80\x93440 (describing these examples).  Imposition of the death penalty in these circumstances, the Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be the \xe2\x80\x98height of arbitrariness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 440 (quoting <em>Mills</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 374).  See also <em>McKoy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 454 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite obviously, the Court decided <em>Mills</em> and <em>McKoy</em> as it did to avoid this possibility.  But because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll of our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence concerning capital sentencing is directed toward the enhancement of reliability and accuracy in some sense,\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that a new rule removes some remote possibility of arbitrary infliction of the death sentence does not suffice to bring it within <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second exception.  <em>Sawyer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 243.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However laudable the <em>Mills</em> rule might be, \xe2\x80\x9cit has none of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in <em>Gideon</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saffle</em>, 494 U. S., at 495.  The <em>Mills</em> rule applies fairly narrowly and works no fundamental shift in \xe2\x80\x9cour understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements</em>\xe2\x80\x9d essential to fundamental fairness.  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Dell</em>, 521 U.

The Court reaches a different conclusion because it reads <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/367/index.html"></a><a href="/us/486/367/index.html">486 U. S. 367</a> (1988), to announce a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d of criminal procedure that may not be applied on federal habeas review to defendants whose convictions became final before <em>Mills</em> was decided.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  In my opinion, however, <em>Mills</em> simply represented a straightforward application of our longstanding view that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under [a] legal syste[m] that permit[s] this unique penalty to be \xe2\x80\xa6 wantonly and \xe2\x80\xa6 freakishly imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a>, 310 (1972) <em>(per curiam)</em> (Stewart, J., concurring).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispute in <em>Mills</em> concerned jury instructions and a verdict form that the majority read to create a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial probability that reasonable jurors . . . well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  486 U. S., at 384.  The resulting unanimity requirement, the majority concluded, violated the Constitution in that it \xe2\x80\x9callow[ed] a \xe2\x80\x98holdout\xe2\x80\x99 juror to prevent the other jurors from considering mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McKoy</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/433/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/433/index.html">494 U. S. 433</a>, 438 (1990) (quoting <em>Mills</em>, 486 U. S., at 375).  When <em>Mills</em> was decided, there was nothing novel about acknowledging that permitting one death-prone juror to control the entire jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision would be arbitrary.  That acknowledgment was a natural outgrowth of our cases condemning mandatory imposition of the death penalty, <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/633/index.html">431 U. S. 633</a> (1977) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html">428 U. S. 280</a> (1976) (plurality opinion), recognizing that arbitrary imposition of that penalty violates the Eighth Amendment,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U. S. 862</a>, 874 (1983); <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>, 189 (1976); <em>Furman</em>, <em>supra;</em> and mandating procedures that guarantee full consideration of mitigating evidence, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a> (1982); <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a> (1978) (plurality opinion).  Indeed, in my judgment, the kind of arbitrariness that would enable 1 vote in favor of death to outweigh 11 in favor of forbearance would violate the bedrock fairness principles that have governed our trial proceedings for centuries.  Rejecting such a manifestly unfair procedural innovation does not announce a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d covered by <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U.

For the reasons identified by the Third Circuit, <em>Banks</em> v. <em>Horn</em>,<em> </em>271 F.\xc2\xa03d 527, 543\xe2\x80\x93551 (2001); see also <em>Banks</em> v. <em>Horn</em>, 316 F.\xc2\xa03d 228, 247 (2003) (leaving in place the relevant portions of the court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier opinion), particularly with respect to the verdict form, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 549\xe2\x80\x93550, I answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy made precisely this point in his concurrence in <em>McKoy</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/433/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/433/index.html">494 U.

S. 367</a> (1988), did not challenge the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that instructions unambiguously requiring unanimity on the existence of any mitigating factor would be unconstitutional; they argued only that reasonable jurors would have understood that in order \xe2\x80\x9cto mark \xe2\x80\x98<em>no</em>\xe2\x80\x99 to each mitigating factor on the sentencing form, all 12 jurors [had to] agree.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 394 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (emphasis added).  I recognize that some Justices believe the <em>Mills</em> Court had no occasion to consider the constitutionality of a unanimity requirement because the State had conceded the point.  See <em>McKoy</em>, 494 U. S., at 459 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough there is language in <em>Mills</em> . . . suggesting that a unanimity requirement would contravene this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions . . . , that issue plainly was not presented in <em>Mills</em>, and can therefore not have been decided\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Mills</em>\xe2\x80\x99 author, Justice Blackmun, disagreed with this view, however: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Maryland instructions [at issue in <em>Mills</em>] were held to be invalid because they were susceptible of two plausible interpretations, <em>and under one of those interpretations the instructions were unconstitutional</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McKoy</em>, 486 U.

I add this word about the way I see its relation to Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion in <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Summerlin</em>, <em>ante</em>, at ___, and to other cases in the line that began with <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/367/index.html">486 U. S. 367</a> (1988), states a new rule of constitutional law for purpose of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general bar to applying such rules on collateral review, the Court invokes the perspective of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all reasonable jurists,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Lambrix</em> v. <em>Singletary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/518/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/518/index.html">520 U. S. 518</a>, 528 (1997)); see also <em>ante</em>, at 8, 9.  It acknowledges, however, that this standard is objective, so that the presence of actual disagreement among jurists and even among Members of this Court does not conclusively establish a rule\xe2\x80\x99s novelty.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa05; cf. <em>Wright</em> v. <em>West,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/277/index.html">505 U. S. 277</a>, 304 (1992) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  This objectively reasonable jurist is a cousin to the common law\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable person, whose job is to impose a judicially determined standard of conduct on litigants who come before the court.  Similarly, the function of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-jurist standard is to distinguish those developments in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence that state judges should have anticipated from those they could not have been expected to foresee.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying <em>Teague</em>, this Court engages in an ongoing process of defining the characteristics of a reasonable jurist, by identifying arguments that reasonable jurists would or would not accept.  The particular characteristic at stake here is the degree to which a reasonable jurist would avoid the risk of a certain kind of erroneous outcome in a capital case.  <em>Mills</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule protects against essentially the same kind of error that Justice Breyer discusses in <em>Summerlin:</em> a death sentence that is arbitrary because it is inaccurate as a putative expression of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2 (quoting <em>Witherspoon</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/510/index.html">391 U. S. 510</a>, 519 (1968)).  Justice Breyer has explained in his <em>Summerlin</em> opinion why some new rules demanding that kind of accuracy should be applied through a <em>Teague</em> exception, and our longstanding espousal of accurate expression of community conscience should also inform our judgment, in any debatable case, about the newness of a rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Justice Stevens says, a death sentence based upon a verdict by 11 jurors who would have relied on a given mitigating circumstance to spare a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s life, and a single holdout who blocked them from doing so, would surely be an egregious failure to express the public conscience accurately.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (dissenting opinion).  The question presented by this case is ultimately whether the Court should deem reasonable, and thus immunize from collateral attack, at least at the first <em>Teague</em> stage, a reading of its pre-<em>Mills</em> precedents that accepts the risk of such errors that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s or Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s jury instructions and verdict form would have produced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes that, as compared to <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a> (1982), <em>Mills</em> \xe2\x80\x9cshift[ed] \xe2\x80\xa6 focus\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cobstructions to the <em>sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s</em> ability to consider mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to the abilities of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual jurors\xe2\x80\x9d to do so, and that a reasonable jurist could have drawn a distinction on this basis.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  This approach gives considerable weight to a reasonable jurist\xe2\x80\x99s analytical capacity to pick out arguably material differences between sets of facts, and relatively less to the jurist\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the substance of the principles underlying our Eighth Amendment cases that follow <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a> (1972) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the reasonable jurist is not inconsistent with some of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s progeny,*<footcall num="*"> for the reasons given in Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in <em>Summerlin</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937, 8\xe2\x80\x939, I am now convinced that this reading of <em>Teague</em> gives too much importance to the finality of capital sentences and not enough to their accuracy.
