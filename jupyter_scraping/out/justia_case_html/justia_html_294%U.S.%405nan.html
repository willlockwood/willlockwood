S. 412</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This suit, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act of Tennessee, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] was brought, on November 21, 1931, in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Part 1, by the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway against the State Highway Commissioner and the Attorney General.  The purpose of the suit is to secure a determination of the constitutionality of an order entered by the Commission and, as so applied, of Chapter 132 of the Tennessee Public Acts of 1921, upon which the order rests. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The statute authorizes the Commission, whenever a state highway crosses a railroad, to require the separation of grades if, in its discretion, "the elimination of any such grade crossing is necessary for the protection of persons traveling on any such highway or any such railroad," and, without conferring upon the Commission any discretion as to the proportion of the cost to be borne by the railroad, requires the latter to pay, in every case, one-half of the total cost of the separation of grades.  The order requires the railway to construct an underpass so as to separate grades where a proposed state highway will cross its main line within the limits of the little town of Lexington, and to bear one-half the cost thereof. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 294 U. S. 413</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The railway does not question the power of the state to build the proposed highway; nor its power to require the separation of grades; nor the appropriateness of the plan adopted for such separation; nor the reasonableness of the cost, $17,400.  It does not deny that, if the proposed highway is built, safety of travel thereon and on the railroad will be promoted by separation of grades.  It concedes that, in Tennessee, as elsewhere, the rule has long been settled that, ordinarily, the state may, under its police power, impose upon a railroad the whole cost of eliminating a grade crossing, or such part thereof, as it deems appropriate. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The claim of unconstitutionality rests wholly upon the special facts here shown.  The main contention is that to impose upon the railway, under these circumstances, one-half of the cost is action so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive it of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The bill of complaint sets forth in detail the facts relied upon as showing that the action was arbitrary and unreasonable.  The answer justifies the imposition solely as an exercise of the police power.  Because many of the allegations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 294 U. S. 414</a></p><p> of the bill were denied, much evidence was introduced.  That contained in the printed record in this Court occupies, with exhibits, 492 pages.  The trial court found that, with one exception, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the evidence fully supported every averment of fact in the bill.  It held that the order and the statute as applied, is so far as they require the railway to pay one-half the cost of the underpass, are arbitrary and unreasonable, and that they are void.  The decree enjoined the Commissioner from attempting to enforce payment by the railway; ordered that the entire cost of the project (except for contributions by the federal government) be borne by the state highway Commission, and directed the defendants to pay the costs of the cause.  Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of the state reversed that decree, ordered the bill dismissed, and allowed an appeal to this Court.  <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St.L. Ry. v. Baker,</em> 167 Tenn. 470, 71 S.W.2d 678, 680.  Consideration of the jurisdiction thereof was ordered postponed to the hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court declined to consider the special facts relied upon as showing that the order, and the statute as applied, were arbitrary and unreasonable, and did not pass upon the question whether the evidence sustained those findings.  It held that the statute was, upon its face, constitutional; that, when it was passed, the state had, in the exercise of its police power, authority to impose upon railroads one-half of the cost of eliminating existing or future grade crossings, and that the court could not "any more" consider "whether the provisions of the act in question have been rendered burdensome or unreasonable by changed economic and transportation conditions" than it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 294 U. S. 415</a></p><p> "could consider changed mental attitudes to determine the constitutionality or enforceability of a statute."  A rule to the contrary is settled by the decisions of this Court.  A statute valid as to one set of facts may be invalid as to another. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A statute valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The police power is subject to the constitutional limitation that it may not be exerted arbitrarily or unreasonably. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  To this limitation, attention was specifically called in cases which have applied most broadly the power to impose upon railroads the cost of separation of grades.  <em>Cincinnati, I. &amp; W.

S. 416</a></p><p> upon the railway one-half of the cost of the underpass was arbitrary and unreasonable, the Supreme Court obviously erred in refusing to consider them.  The charge of arbitrariness is based primarily upon the revolutionary changes incident to transportation wrought in recent years by the widespread introduction of motor vehicles; the assumption by the federal government of the functions of roadbuilder; the resulting depletion of rail revenues; the change in the character, the construction, and the use of highways; the change in the occasion for elimination of grade crossings, in the purpose of such elimination, and in the chief beneficiaries thereof, and the change in the relative responsibility of the railroads and vehicles moving on the highways as elements of danger and causes of accidents.  The facts specifically found, or of which the courts could take judicial notice, are these:</p>\n<p>1. The decree of the trial court recites, as a finding upon the evidence,</p>\n<p>"that this underpass is a part of a statewide and nationwide plan to foster commerce by motor vehicle on the public highways, the result of which is to afford competition with railroads, and that the decision to build this underpass, its location and construction, was not in any proper sense an exercise of the police power, but rather, as set forth in the bill of complaint, pursuant to a general plan of internal improvement fostered by the Congress of the United States in conjunction with the several States to make a nationwide system of superhighways in the interest of interstate commerce by motor vehicle, much of which is in active competition with the railroads themselves; . . . that, in the interest of commerce by motor vehicles on the public highways, this was a proper engineering project, properly conceived, located, designed and constructed;"</p>\n<p>but</p>\n<p>"that this underpass did not involve an exercise of the police power any more than many other features of this project, such as elimination of curves, grades, widening the pavement, et cetera. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 294 U. S. 417</a></p><p></p>\n<p>2. The state highways of Tennessee (as distinguished from county and city roads and turnpikes) have their origin in the federal aid highway legislation. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The aim of that legislation is "a connected system of roads for the whole Nation;" "to provide complete and economical highway transport throughout the Nation;" to furnish "a new means of transportation, no less important to the country as a whole than that offered by the railroads;" [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] to establish "lines of motor traffic in interstate commerce." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The immediate interest of the federal government is, in part, the national defense, as well as the transportation of the mails. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The relief of the unemployment incident to the business depression has been the main incentive for highway construction since April 4, 1930, the period in which the highway here in question was undertaken and completed. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>To achieve its purposes, the federal government has made large contributions to the cost of the federal aid highway system.  In each year, it has made to each state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 294 U. S. 418</a></p><p> grants in money, proportioned according to various factors, to be expended in defraying up to one-half the cost of constructing therein the designated highways. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In addition, it has, through the War Department, allotted to the several states their <em>pro rata</em> shares of surplus war equipment and supplies valued at more than $224,000,000. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  It has at all times given to the several states the benefit of its economic and physical research, and other aid by its experts and administrators. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  It has, since the depression, given to the several states emergency grants to be expended in highway construction for the relief of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 294 U. S. 419</a></p><p> unemployment. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In the fiscal years ending June 30, 1931, 1932, and 1933, during which this highway was authorized and completed, Tennessee received from the federal government, for the highway system, in cash, $11,063,325; [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and at the close of that period practically the entire expense of building federal aid roads in the state was being borne by the federal government. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, has determined in large measure not only the location of the federal aid highways in the several states, but also their character and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 294 U. S. 420</a></p><p> their incidents.  Early legislation provided that:</p>\n<p>"The Secretary of Agriculture and the State highway department of each State shall agree upon the roads to be constructed therein and the character and method of construction. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Act of 1921 required each state to select and submit to the Secretary, for approval as the object of future federal aid expenditures, "a system of highways not to exceed 7 percentum of the total highway mileage of such State;" the system was to</p>\n<p>"be divided into two classes, one of which shall be known as primary or interstate highways, . . . and the other which shall connect or correlate therewith and be known as secondary or intercounty highways. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]"</p>\n<p>Congress transferred to the Secretary the powers and duties in relation to highways and highway transport originally conferred upon the Council of National Defense. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The War Plans Division of the General Staff and Corps of Engineers of the War Department promptly cooperated with the Bureau of Public Roads "in a study the purpose of which is the selection of those highways which are important from a military standpoint." [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Upon the Secretary devolves the duty of prescribing needful rules and regulations, including such recommendations as he might deem necessary for "insuring the safety of traffic on the highways." [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Both the federal aid legislation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 294 U. S. 421</a></p><p> and the regulations adopted thereunder encourage the elimination of grade crossings. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The general principles adopted by the Bureau of Roads to be applied where possible treat "all intersections of a railway and highway at grade" as "a condition dangerous to traffic on the highway -- which should not exist in a well designed and completed system;" treat topographic conditions as having only an "incidental bearing;" and refuse to treat "unobstructed view of the railway track from the highway" as constituting a safe crossing. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The federal government may pay one-half of the total cost of an underpass, even if the state is relieved by contributions of the railroad or others from paying the other half. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>3. Federal aid highways are designed so that motor vehicles may move thereon at a speed commonly much greater than that of railroad trains. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  The main purpose of grade separation, therefore, is now the furtherance of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 294 U. S. 422</a></p><p> uninterrupted rapid movement by motor vehicles.  In this respect, grade separation is a desirable engineering feature comparable to removal of grades and curves, to widening the highway, to strengthening and draining it, to shortening distance, to setting up guard rails, and to bridging streams. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  The railroad has ceased to be the prime instrument of danger and the main cause of accidents. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 294 U. S. 423</a></p><p> It is the railroad which now requires protection from dangers incident to motor transportation.  Prior to the establishment of the federal aid system, Tennessee highways were built under the direction of the county courts, and paid for out of funds raised locally by taxation or otherwise. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  They served, in the main, local traffic.  The long distance traffic was served almost wholly by the railroads and the water lines.  Under those conditions, the occasion for separation of grades was mainly the danger incident to rail operations, and the promotion of safety was then the main purpose of grade separation.  Then, it was reasonable to impose upon the railroad a large part of the cost of eliminating grade crossings, and the imposition was rarely a hardship.  For the need for eliminating existing crossings, and the need of new highways free from grade crossings, arose usually from the growth of the community in which the grade separation was made; this growth was mainly the result of the transportation facilities offered through the railroad; the separation of grade crossings was a normal incident of the growth of rail operations, and, as the highways were then feeders of rail traffic, the community\'s growth and every improvement of highway facilities benefited the railroad.  The effect upon the railroad of constructing federal aid highways like that here in question is entirely different.  They are not feeders of rail traffic.  They deplete the existing rail traffic and the revenues of the railroads.  Separation of grades serves to intensify the motor competition and to further deplete rail traffic.  The avoidance thereby made possible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 294 U. S. 424</a></p><p> of traffic interruptions incident to crossing at grade are now of far greater importance to the highway users than it is to the railroad crossed.  For the rail operations are few, those of motor vehicles very numerous.</p>\n<p>4. Lexington is a rural community of 1,823 inhabitants located in a sparsely settled territory.  The construction of the new highway with the underpass was not designated to meet local transportation needs.  It was undertaken to serve as a link in a nationwide system of highways. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  State highway No. 20, as formerly routed, passed through Lexington on Clifton Street, and crossed the railroad at grade; it was adequate for the existing traffic and that to be expected.  The traffic on that highway was, and is, small.  The grade crossing has presented no serious interruption to traffic.  The trains are infrequent.  Only six trains are operated now each way in every twenty-four hours; five of these moving between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., when there is substantially no highway travel. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  The grade crossing on the old route is protected by the most modern electrical device.  That the crossing is not dangerous is attested by the fact that, during the ten years following January 1, 1921, there were but two minor accidents, and these were settled for $50.  That the present facilities are deemed locally both safe and adequate is attested by the fact that neither the city authorities nor anyone else has suggested elimination of this grade crossing; that the grade crossing is to remain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 294 U. S. 425</a></p><p> unchanged after the new highway is put into use, and that the Clifton street route will continue to be used for the local traffic. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>5. The underpass required is for a new and additional highway over which state highway No. 20 is being rerouted, which will be a part of a federal aid route between Nashville and Memphis, the best route between those two cities, and which will connect at these termini with highways extending into other states.  This highway was planned by the State Highway Department, acting in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Roads of the federal government.  It is part of the secondary or intercounty system, but, because of the expected traffic, the district engineer of the Bureau of Roads, in recommending its approval, characterized it as a route of primary importance.  The underpass was prescribed not upon consideration of local safety needs, but in conformity to general plans of the federal and state highway engineers, as being a proper engineering feature in the construction of a nationwide system of highways for high-speed motor vehicle transportation, and because it is the policy of the federal authorities to make the avoidance of grade crossings a condition of a grant in aid of construction.  The requirement of the underpass, and the payment by the railway under the 1921 Tennessee Act of one-half the cost of separating the grades, are results of the federal aid legislation.  Final payment of federal aid on this project was conditioned upon commencement of the construction of this underpass. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 294 U. S. 426</a></p><p></p>\n<p>6. The new highway, paralleling lines of the railway and intended for rapid moving motor vehicles, will, through competition for both freight and passenger traffic, seriously decrease rail traffic and deplete the railway\'s revenue and net earnings.  Practically all vehicles moving upon it will directly or indirectly compete for traffic with the railway. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Busses will operate over the new highway in regular scheduled movements in the same way as passenger trains.  Trucks, some of them 70 feet in length and many weighing with load as much as 50,000 pounds, operated by common carriers, by contract carrier, and by private concerns, will compete for the most profitable classes of freight.  The competition, besides reducing the volume of traffic, will compel reduction of rates.</p>\n<p>How disastrously such competition will affect the railway\'s traffic and revenues is shown by its own experience since the state commenced, with the aid of the federal government, a system of highways paralleling the lines of the railway.  The gross passenger revenue fell from $5,661,011.08 in 1920 to $2,095,942.29 in 1930, and to $1,139,238 in the first nine months of 1931.  The railway carried, in 1920, 4,385,630 revenue passengers; in 1930, only 680,347, and in the first nine months of 1931, only 370,445.  The railway\'s freight traffic experienced a similar decline.  Of the less than carload freight, more than two-thirds was diverted from the railroads to motor trucks.  In many </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 294 U. S. 427</a></p><p> classes of carload traffic, similar decreases were experienced by rail carriers.  In 1921, the railroads brought into Nashville 5,689 cars of livestock; being 69.79% of the total.  In 1930, they brought in only 641 cars, being 21.24% of the total.  That the decrease in the railway\'s traffic was due mainly to increased motor competition following the construction of the new highways appears from the fact that the decrease began while general business was active, and that, even in the years of economic depression, the railway\'s freight traffic was practically constant in the relatively few regions where its rail lines were not paralleled by hard surfaced highways, and that traffic increased when highways paralleling its lines were temporarily closed for reconstruction.  The reduction in traffic and depletion in revenues has been particularly severe during the three years preceding 1933.</p>\n<p>7. While the railway, the sufferer from the construction of the new highway, is burdened with one-half the cost of the underpass, the owners of trucks and busses and others who are beneficiaries of its construction are immune from making any direct contribution toward the cost.  It is true that one-half of the cost is, by law, to be borne by the highway fund of Tennessee (except insofar as it may be covered by the federal aid), [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] and that the truck and bus owners and others contribute as taxpayers to that fund.  But, while nearly 28% of the gross revenues of the railway is required annually to pay the state and local taxes and the cost of maintaining the roadway acquired and constructed at its own expense, the state commercial motor carriers, which are supplied by the state with the roadway on which they move, pay in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 294 U. S. 428</a></p><p> state and local taxes not more than 7% of their gross revenues.  The taxes laid upon truck and bus owners are clearly insufficient to pay their fair share even of the cost and maintenance of the highways which serve them.  Motor vehicle taxes of all kinds, <em>ad valorem,</em> privilege, license plate, and others will not pay for one-half of the annual expenditure in Tennessee for highways.  The balance is being paid in part by general property taxes, in part by borrowing, and in part by the federal government . Of the <em>ad valorem</em> taxes paid by the railway to the state and the political divisions thereof, about 20% is allocated directly to roads, some of which are no longer feeders to its traffic, but serve as highways for the traffic taken by its competitors.  The relative <em>pro rata</em> tax burden laid upon common carriers by motor vehicle is alleged to be one-fourth of that laid upon the railroads. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  The Supreme Court of Tennessee erred in refusing to consider whether the facts relied upon by the railway established as arbitrary and unreasonable the imposition upon it of one-half the cost of the underpass.  The promotion of public convenience will not justify requiring of a railroad, any more than of others, the expenditure of money unless it can be shown that a duty to provide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 294 U. S. 429</a></p><p> the particular convenience rests upon it.  <em>Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/164/403/case.html">164 U.

Besides these, the state levies a mileage tax upon commercial vehicles.  Mileage taxes collected from intrastate operators go into the general state funds; those collected from interstate operators, into the highway fund.  In 1932, it was testified, this tax yielded a gross revenue of approximately $100,000, and a net revenue of $40,000 for the general fund, and $18,000 for the highway fund.  The <em>ad valorem</em> taxes paid by common carrier motor vehicles are negligible.
