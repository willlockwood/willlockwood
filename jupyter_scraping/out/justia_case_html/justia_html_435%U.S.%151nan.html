Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S.  151 (1978)</h3><p><b>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield</b></p><p><b>No. 76-930</b></p><p><b>Argued October 31, 1977</b></p><p><b>Decided March 6, 1978</b></p><p><b>435 U.S. 151</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellees challenge the constitutionality of the Washington Tanker Law, which regulates the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in Puget Sound, both enrolled (those engaged in domestic or coastwise trade) and registered (those engaged in foreign trade).  Three operative provisions are involved:  (1) a requirement (\xc2\xa7 88.16.180) that both enrolled and registered oil tankers of at least 50,000 deadweight tons (DWT) carry a Washington-licensed pilot while navigating the Sound; (2) a requirement (\xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2)) that enrolled and registered oil tankers of from 40,000 to 125,000 DWT satisfy certain design or safety standards, or else use tug escorts while operating in the Sound; and (3) a ban on the operation in the Sound of any tanker exceeding 125,000 DWT (\xc2\xa7 88.16.190(1)).  A three-judge District Court adjudged the statute void in its entirety, upholding appellees\' contentions that all the Tanker Law\'s operative provisions were preempted by federal law particularly the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), which is designed to insure vessel safety and the protection of navigable waters and adjacent shore areas from tanker oil spillage.  Title I of the PWSA empowers the Secretary of Transportation to establish, operate, and require compliance with "vessel traffic services and systems" for ports subject to congested traffic and to control vessel traffic in especially hazardous areas by, among other things, establishing vessel size limitations.  Pursuant to this Title, the Secretary, through his delegate, has promulgated the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic System, which contains general and communication rules, vessel movement reporting requirements, a traffic separation scheme, special ship movement rules applying to Rosario Strait (where, under a local Coast Guard rule, the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel -- in bad weather, 40,000 DWT -- in either direction at a given time is prohibited), and other requirements.  A State, though permitted to impose higher equipment or safety standards, may do so "for structures only."  Title II, whose goals are to provide vessel safety and protect the marine environment, provides that the Secretary shall issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of oil tankers; provides for inspection of vessels for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 435 U. S. 152</a></p><p> compliance with the Secretary\'s safety and environmental regulations; and prohibits the carrying of specified cargoes absent issuance of a certificate of inspection evidencing compliance with the regulations.  Title 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 364 provides that every coastwise seagoing steam vessel subject to federal navigation laws not sailing under register shall, when under way, be under the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard.  Title 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 215 adds that no state government shall impose upon steam vessel pilots any obligation to procure a state license in addition to the federal license, though it is specified that the provision does not affect state requirements for carrying pilots on other than coastwise vessels.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. To the extent that \xc2\xa7 88.16.180 requires enrolled tankers to carry state-licensed pilots, the State is precluded by 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 215, 364 from imposing its own pilotage requirements and to that extent the state law is invalid.  The District Court\'s judgment was overly broad, however, in invalidating the pilot provision in its entirety, since under both 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 215 and the PWSA States are free to impose pilotage requirements on registered vessels entering and leaving their ports.

Congress in Title II intended uniform national standards for design and construction of tankers that would foreclose the imposition of different or more stringent state requirements, and since the federal scheme aims at precisely the same ends as \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) of the Tanker Law, the different and higher design requirements of that provision, standing alone, are invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v.

The District Court erred in holding that the alternative tug requirement of \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) was invalid as conflicting with the PWSA, for the Secretary has not as yet promulgated his own tug requirement for Puget Sound tanker navigation or decided that there should be no such requirement.

The exclusion from Puget Sound of any tanker exceeding 125,000 DWT pursuant to \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(1) is invalid under the Supremacy Clause in light of Title I and the Secretary\'s actions thereunder, a conclusion confirmed by the legislative history of Title I, which shows that Congress intended that there be a single federal decisionmaker to promulgate limitations on tanker size.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), 86 Stat. 424, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1221 <em>et seq.</em> (1970 ed., Supp. V), and 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 391a (1970 ed., Supp. V), navigation in Puget Sound, a body of inland water lying along the northwest coast of the State of Washington, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] is controlled in major respects by federal law.  The PWSA also subjects to federal rule the design and operating characteristics of oil tankers.</p>\n<p>This case arose when ch. 125, 1975 Wash. Laws, 1st Extr. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 435 U. S. 155</a></p><p> Sess., Wash.Rev.Code \xc2\xa7 88.16.170 <em>et seq.</em> (Supp. 1975) (Tanker Law), was adopted with the aim of regulating in particular respects the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in Puget Sound.  In response to the constitutional challenge to the law brought by the appellees herein, the District Court held that, under the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which declares that the federal law "shall be the supreme Law of the Land," the Tanker Law could not coexist with the PWSA, and was totally invalid.  <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Evans,</em> No. C-75-648-M (WD Wash. Sept. 24, 1976).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Located adjacent to Puget Sound are six oil refineries having a total combined processing capacity of 359,500 barrels of oil per day.  In 1971, appellee Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) began operating an oil refinery at Cherry Point, situated in the northern part of the Sound.  Since then, the crude oil processed at that refinery has been delivered principally by pipeline from Canada [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and by tankers from the Persian Gulf; tankers will also be used to transport oil there from the terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline at Valdez, Alaska.  Of the 105 tanker deliveries of crude oil to the Cherry Point refinery from 1972 through 1975, 95 were by means of tankers in excess of 40,000 deadweight tons (DWT), [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and, prior to the effective date of the Tanker Law, 15 of them were by means of tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT.</p>\n<p>Appellee Seatrain Lines, Inc. (Seatrain), owns or charters 12 tanker vessels in domestic and foreign commerce, of which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 435 U. S. 156</a></p><p> four exceed 125,000 DWT.  Seatrain also operates through a wholly owned subsidiary corporation a shipbuilding facility in New York City, where it has recently constructed or is constructing four tankers, each with a 225,000 DWT capacity.</p>\n<p>On the day the Tanker Law became effective, ARCO brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.  Seatrain was later permitted to intervene as a plaintiff.  Named as defendants were the state and local officials responsible for the enforcement of the Tanker Law. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The complaint alleged that the statute was preempted by federal law, in particular the PWSA, and that it was thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  It was also alleged that the law imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, and that it interfered with the federal regulation of foreign affairs.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2281, 2284, a three-judge court was convened to determine the case.</p>\n<p>The case was briefed and argued before the District Court on the basis of a detailed stipulation of facts.  Also before the court was the brief of the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> which contended that the Tanker Law was preempted in its entirety by the PWSA and other federal legislation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The three-judge court agreed with the plaintiffs and the United States, ruling that all of the operative provisions of the Tanker Law were preempted, and enjoining appellants and their successors from enforcing the chapter. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We noted probable jurisdiction of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 435 U.

S. 363</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of each of the three operative provisions of the Tanker Law.  We address first Wash.Rev.Code \xc2\xa7 88.16.180 (Supp. 1975), which requires both enrolled and registered [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] oil tankers of at least 50,000 DWT to take on a pilot licensed by the State of Washington while navigating Puget Sound.  The District Court held that, insofar as the law required a tanker "enrolled in the coastwise trade" to have a local pilot on board, it was in direct conflict with 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 215, 364.  We agree.</p>\n<p>Section 364 provides that</p>\n<p>"every coastwise seagoing steam vessel subject to the navigation laws of the United States, . . . not sailing under register, shall, when under way, . . . be under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 435 U. S. 159</a></p><p> the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p>Section 215 adds that</p>\n<p>"[n]o State or municipal government shall impose upon pilots of steam vessels any obligation to procure a State or other license in addition to that issued by the United States . . ."</p>\n<p>It goes on to explain that the statute shall not be construed to</p>\n<p>"affect any regulation established by the laws of any State, requiring vessels entering or leaving a port in any such State, <em>other than coastwise steam vessels,</em> to take a pilot duly licensed or authorized by the laws of such State. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The Court has long held that these two statutes, read together, give the Federal Government exclusive authority to regulate pilots on enrolled vessels, and that they preclude a State from imposing its own pilotage requirements upon them.  <em>See Anderson v. Pacific Coast S.S. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/225/187/case.html">225 U. S. 187</a></span> (1912); <em>Spraigue v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/90/case.html">118 U. S. 90</a></span> (1886).  Thus, to the extent that the Tanker Law requires enrolled tankers to take on state-licensed pilots, the District Court correctly concluded, as the State now concedes, that it was in conflict with federal law, and was therefore invalid.</p>\n<p>While the opinion of the court below indicated that the pilot provision of the Tanker Law was void only to the extent that it applied to tankers enrolled in the coastwise trade, the judgment itself declared the statute null and void in its entirety.  No part of the statute was excepted from the scope of the injunctive relief.  The judgment was overly broad, for just as it is clear that States may not regulate the pilots of enrolled vessels, it is equally clear that they are free to impose pilotage requirements on registered vessels entering and leaving their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 435 U. S. 160</a></p><p> ports.  Not only does 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 215 so provide, as was noted above, but so also does \xc2\xa7 101(5) of the PWSA, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1221(5) (1970 ed., Supp. V), which authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to</p>\n<p>"require pilots on self-propelled vessels engaged in the foreign trades in areas and under circumstances where a pilot is not otherwise required by State law to be on board until the State having jurisdiction of an area involved establishes a requirement for a pilot in that area or under the circumstances involved. . . ."</p>\n<p>Accordingly, as appellees now agree, the State was free to require registered tankers in excess of 50,000 DWT to take on a state-licensed pilot upon entering Puget Sound.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We next deal with \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) of the Tanker Law, which requires enrolled and registered oil tankers of from 40,000 to 125,000 DWT to possess all of the following "standard safety features":</p>\n<p>"(a) Shaft horsepower in the ratio of one horsepower to each two and one-half deadweight tons; and"</p>\n<p>"(b) Twin screws; and"</p>\n<p>"(c) Double bottoms, underneath all oil and liquid cargo compartments; and"</p>\n<p>"(d) Two radars in working order and operating, one of which must be collision avoidance radar; and"</p>\n<p>"(e) Such other navigational position location systems as may be prescribed from time to time by the board of pilotage commissioners. . . ."</p>\n<p>This section contains a proviso, however, stating that, if the</p>\n<p>"tanker is in ballast or is under escort of a tug or tugs with an aggregate shaft horsepower equivalent to five percent of the deadweight tons of that tanker . . . ,"</p>\n<p>the design requirements are not applicable.  The District Court held invalid this alternative design/tug requirement of the Tanker Law.  We agree insofar as we hold that the foregoing design requirements, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 435 U. S. 161</a></p><p> standing alone, are invalid in the light of the PWSA and its regulatory implementation.</p>\n<p>The PWSA contains two Titles representing somewhat overlapping provisions designed to insure vessel safety and the protection of the navigable waters, their resources, and shore areas from tanker cargo spillage.  The focus of Title I, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1221-1227 (1970 ed., Supp. V), is traffic control at local ports; Title II\'s principal concern is tanker design and construction. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  For present purposes, the relevant part is Title II, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 391a (1970 ed., Supp. V), which amended the Tank Vessel Act of 1936, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 4417a, as added, 49 Stat. 1889.</p>\n<p>Title II begins by declaring that the protection of life, property, and the marine environment from harm requires the promulgation of "comprehensive minimum standards of design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, and operation" for vessels carrying certain cargoes in bulk, primarily oil and fuel tankers.  \xc2\xa7 391a(1).  To implement the twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment, it is provided that the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is located [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] "shall establish" such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of the covered vessels and with respect to a variety of related matters.  \xc2\xa7 391a(3).  In issuing regulations, the Secretary is to consider the kinds and grades of cargo permitted to be on board such vessels, to consult with other federal agencies, and to identify separately the regulations established for vessel safety and those to protect marine environment.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 435 U. S. 162</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Section 391a(5) provides for inspection of vessels for compliance with the Secretary\'s safety regulations. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  No vessel subject to Title II may have on board an of the specified cargoes until a certificate of inspection has been issued to the vessel and a permit endorsed thereon</p>\n<p>"indicating that such vessel is in compliance with the provisions of this section and the rules and regulations for vessel safety established hereunder, and showing the kinds and grades of such cargo that such vessel may have on board or transport."</p>\n<p>It is provided that in lieu of inspection under this section the Secretary is to accept from vessels of foreign nations valid certificates of inspection "recognized under law or treaty by the United States."</p>\n<p>Title II also directs the Secretary to inspect tank vessels for compliance with the regulations which he is required to issue for the protection of the marine environment. \xc2\xa7 391a(6). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Compliance with these separate regulations, which must </p><p><a class="page-number" name="163">Page 435 U. S. 163</a></p><p> satisfy specified standards, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and the consequent privilege of having on board the relevant cargo are evidenced by certificates of compliance issued by the Secretary or by appropriate endorsements on the vessels\' certificates of inspection.  Certificates are valid for the period specified by the Secretary ad are subject to revocation when it is found that the vessel does not comply with the conditions upon which the certificate was issued. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In lieu of a certificate of compliance with his own environmental regulations relating to vessel design, construction, alteration, and repair, the Secretary may, but need not, accept valid certificates from foreign vessels evidencing compliance with rules and regulations issued under a treaty, convention, or agreement providing for reciprocity of recognition of certificates or similar documents.  \xc2\xa7 391a(7)(D).</p>\n<p>This statutory pattern shows that Congress, insofar as design characteristics are concerned, has entrusted to the Secretary the duty of determining which oil tankers are sufficiently safe to be allowed to proceed in the navigable waters of the United States.  This indicates to us that Congress intended uniform national standards for design and construction of tankers that would foreclose the imposition of different or more stringent state requirements. In particular, as we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 435 U. S. 164</a></p><p> see it, Congress did not anticipate that a vessel found to be in compliance with the Secretary\'s design and construction regulations and holding a Secretary\'s permit, or its equivalent, to carry the relevant cargo would nevertheless be barred by state law from operating in the navigable waters of the United States on the ground that its design characteristics constitute an undue hazard.</p>\n<p>We do not question in the slightest the prior cases holding that enrolled and registered vessels must conform to "reasonable, nondiscriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures . . . " imposed by a State.  <em>Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/265/case.html">431 U.

Detroit,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/440/case.html">362 U. S. 440</a></span> (1960).  Similarly, the mere fact that a vessel has been inspected and found to comply with the Secretary\'s vessel safety regulations does not prevent a State or city from enforcing local laws having other purposes, such as a local smoke abatement law.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But in none of the relevant cases sustaining the application of state laws to federally licensed or inspected vessels did the federal licensing or inspection procedure implement a substantive rule of federal law addressed to the object also sought to be achieved by the challenged state regulation.  <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit,</em> for example, made it plain that there was "no overlap between the scope of the federal ship inspection laws and that of the municipal ordinance . . . " there involved.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/440/case.html#446">362 U. S. 446</a></span>.

There, the Court concluded that the Federal Motor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 435 U. S. 165</a></p><p> Boat Act, although applicable to the vessels in question, was of limited scope and did not include provision for "the inspection of the hull and machinery of respondents motor-driven tugs in order to insure safety or determine seaworthiness . . . ," as long as the tugs did not carry passengers, freight, or inflammable liquid cargo.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/1/case.html#8">302 U. S. 8</a></span>.  It followed that state inspection to insure safety was not in conflict with federal law, the Court also holding that the limited federal regulations did not imply an intent to exclude state regulation of those matters not touched by the federal statute.</p>\n<p>Here, we have the very situation that <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit</em> and <em>Kelly v. Washington</em> put aside.  Title II aims at insuring vessel safety and protecting the marine environment, and the Secretary must issue all design and construction regulations that he deems necessary for these ends, after considering the specified statutory standards.  The federal scheme thus aims precisely at the same ends as does \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) of the Tanker Law.  Furthermore, under the PWSA, after considering the statutory standards and issuing all design requirements that in his judgment are necessary, the Secretary inspects and certifies each vessel as sufficiently safe to protect the marine environment and issues a permit or its equivalent to carry tank vessel cargoes.  Refusing to accept the federal judgment, however, the State now seeks to exclude from Puget Sound vessels certified by the Secretary as having acceptable design characteristics unless they satisfy the different and higher design requirements imposed by state law.  The Supremacy Clause dictates that the federal judgment that a vessel is safe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment.</p>\n<p>Enforcement of the state requirements would at least frustrate what seems to us to be the evident congressional intention to establish a uniform federal regime controlling the design of oil tankers.  The original Tank Vessel Act, amended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 435 U. S. 166</a></p><p> by Title II, sought to effect a "reasonable and uniform set of rules and regulations concerning ship construction . . . ," H.R.Rep. No. 2962, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (196); and far from evincing a different purpose, the Title II amendments strongly indicate that, insofar as tanker design is concerned, Congress anticipated the enforcement of federal standards that would preempt state efforts to mandate different or higher design requirements. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>That the Nation was to speak with one voice with respect to tanker design standards is supported by the legislative history of Title II, particularly as it reveals a decided congressional preference for arriving at international standards for building tank vessels.  The Senate Report recognizes that vessel design "has traditionally been an area for international, rather than national, action," and that "international solutions in this area are preferable, since the problem of marine pollution is world-wide." [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Senate Report 23.  Congress did provide that the Secretary\'s safety regulations would not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 435 U. S. 167</a></p><p> apply to foreign ships holding compliance certificates under regulations arrived at by international agreement; but, in the end, the environmental protection regulation were made applicable to foreign, as well as to American, vessels, since it was thought to be necessary for the achievement of the Act\'s purposes. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Although not acceding to the request of those who thought that foreign vessels should be completely exempt from regulation under Title II, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] Congress did not abandon the effort to achieve international agreement on what the proper design standards should be.  It wrote into Title II a deferral procedure, requiring the Secretary at the outset to transmit his proposed environmental protection rules and regulations with respect to vessel design to the appropriate international forums for consideration as international standards.  \xc2\xa7 391a(7)(b).  In order to facilitate the international consideration of these design requirements, Title II specified that the rules and regulations governing foreign vessels and United States vessels engaged in foreign trade could not become effective before January 1, 1974, unless they were consonant with an international agreement.  \xc2\xa7 391a(7)(C).  As noted by the Senate Report, this requirement demonstrated the "committee\'s strong intention that standards for the protection of the marine environment be adopted, multilaterally if possible, but adopted in any event."  Senate Report 28.</p>\n<p>Congress expressed a preference for international action and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 435 U. S. 168</a></p><p> expressly anticipated that foreign vessels would or could be considered sufficiently safe for certification by the Secretary if they satisfied the requirements arrived at by treaty or convention; it is therefore clear that Title II leaves no room for the States to impose different or stricter design requirements than those which Congress has enacted with the hope of having them internationally adopted, or has accepted as the result of international accord.  A state law in this area, such as the first part of \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2), would frustrate the congressional desire of achieving uniform international standards, and is thus at odds with "the object sought to be obtained by [Title II] and the character of obligations imposed by it. . . ."  <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span>.  In this respect, the District Court was quite correct. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Of course, that a tanker is certified under federal law as a safe vessel insofar as its design and construction characteristics are concerned does not mean that it is free to ignore otherwise valid state or federal rules or regulations that do </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 435 U. S. 169</a></p><p> not constitute design or construction specifications.  Registered vessels, for example, as we have already indicated, must observe Washington\'s pilotage requirement.  In our view, both enrolled and registered vessels must also comply with the provision of the Tanker Law that requires tug escorts for tankers over 40,000 DWT that do not satisfy the design provisions specified in \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2).  This conclusion requires analysis of Title I of the PWSA, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1221-1227 (1970 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In order to prevent damage to vessels, structures, and shore areas, as well as environmental harm to navigable waters and the resources therein that might result from vessel or structure damage, Title I authorizes the Secretary to establish and operate "vessel traffic services and systems" for ports subject to congested traffic, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] as well as to require ships to comply with the systems and to have the equipment necessary to do so.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1221(1) and (2).  The Secretary may "control vessel traffic" under various hazardous conditions by specifying the times for vessel movement, by establishing size and speed limitations and vessel operating conditions, and by restricting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 435 U. S. 170</a></p><p> vessel operation to those vessels having the particular operating characteristics which he considers necessary for safe operation under the circumstances.  \xc2\xa7 1221(3).  In addition, the Secretary may require vessels engaged in foreign trade to carry pilots until the State having jurisdiction establishes a pilot requirement, \xc2\xa7 1221(5); he may establish minimum safety equipment requirements for shore structures, \xc2\xa7 1221(7); and he may establish waterfront safety zones or other measures for limited, controlled, or conditional access when necessary for the protection of vessels, structures, waters, or shore areas, \xc2\xa7 1221(8).</p>\n<p>In carrying out his responsibilities under the Act, the Secretary may issue rules and regulations.  \xc2\xa7 1224.  In doing so, he is directed to consider a wide variety of interests that might affect the exercise of his authority, such as possible environmental impact, the scope and degree of the hazards involved, and</p>\n<p>"vessel traffic characteristics including minimum interference with the flow of commercial traffic, traffic volume, the sizes and types of vessels, the usual nature of local cargoes, and similar factors."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1222(e).  Section 1222(b) provides that nothing in Title I is to</p>\n<p>"prevent a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing for structures only higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter."</p>\n<p>Exercising this authority, the Secretary, through his delegate, the Coast Guard, has issued Navigation Safety Regulations, 33 CFR Part 164 (adopted at 42 Fed.Reg. 5956 (1977)).  Of particular importance to this case, he has promulgated the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic System containing general rules, communication rules, vessel movement reporting requirements, a traffic separation scheme, special rules for ship movement in Rosario Strait, descriptions and geographic coordinates of the separation zones and traffic lanes, and a specification for precautionary areas and reporting points. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  33 CFR Part 161, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 435 U. S. 171</a></p><p> Subpart B (1976), as amended, 42 Fed.Reg. 29480 (1977).  There is also delegated to Coast Guard district commanders and captains of ports the authority to exercise the Secretary\'s powers under \xc2\xa7 1221(3) to direct the anchoring, mooring, and movements of vessels; temporarily to establish traffic routing schemes; and to specify vessel size and speed limitations and operating conditions.  33 CFR \xc2\xa7 160.35 (1976).  Traffic in Rosario Strait is subject to a local Coast Guard rule prohibiting "the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait in either direction at any given time."  During the periods of bad weather, the size limitation is reduced to approximately 40,000 DWT.  App. 65.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>A tug escort provision is not a design requirement, such as is promulgated under Title II.  It is more akin to an operating rule arising from the peculiarities of local waters that call for special precautionary measures, and, as such, is a safety measure clearly within the reach of the Secretary\'s authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1221(3)(iii) and (iv) to establish "vessel size and speed limitations and vessel operating conditions" and to restrict vessel operation to those with "particular operating characteristics and capabilities. . . ."  Title I, however, merely authorizes, and does not require, the Secretary to issue regulations to implement the provisions of the Title; and, assuming that \xc2\xa7 1222(b) prevents a State from issuing "higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards," <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#174">435 U. S. 174</a></span>, it does so only with respect to those requirements or standards "which may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter."</p>\n<p>The relevant inquiry under Title I with respect to the State\'s power to impose a tug escort rule is thus whether the Secretary has either promulgated his own tug requirement for Puget Sound tanker navigation or has decided that no such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 435 U. S. 172</a></p><p> requirement should be imposed at all.  It does not appear to us that he has yet taken either course.  He has, however, issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, 41 Fed.Reg. 18770 (1976), to amend his Navigation Safety Regulations issued under Title I, 33 CFR Part 164 (1977), so as to require tug escorts for certain vessels operating in confined waters. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The notice says that these rules, if adopted, "are intended to provide uniform guidance for the maritime industry and Captains of the Port."  41 Fed.Reg. 18771 (1976).  It may be that rules will be forthcoming that will preempt the State\'s present tug escort rule, but until that occurs, the State\'s requirement need not give way under the Supremacy Clause. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Nor, for constitutional purposes, does it make substantial difference that. under the Tanker Law, those vessels that satisfy the State\'s design requirements are, in effect, exempted from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 435 U. S. 173</a></p><p> the tug escort requirement. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Given the validity of a general rule prescribing tug escorts for all tankers, Washington is also privileged, insofar as the Supremacy Clause is concerned, to waive the rule for tankers having specified design characteristics. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  For this reason, we conclude that the District Court erred in holding that the alternative tug requirement of \xc2\xa7 88.1.190(2) was invalid because of its conflict with the PWSA.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>We cannot arrive at the same conclusion with respect to the remaining provision of the Tanker Law at issue here.  Section 88.16.190(1) excludes from Puget Sound under any circumstances any tanker in excess of 125,000 DWT.  In our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 435 U. S. 174</a></p><p> view, this provision is invalid in light of Title I and the Secretary\'s actions taken thereunder.</p>\n<p>We begin with the premise that the Secretary has the authority to establish "vessel size and speed limitations," \xc2\xa7 1221(3)(iii), and that local Coast Guard officers have been authorized to exercise this power on his behalf.  Furthermore, \xc2\xa7 1222(b), by permitting the State to impose higher equipment or safety standards "for structures only," impliedly forbids higher state standards for vessels.  The implication is strongly supported by the legislative history of the PWSA.  The House Report explains that the original wording of the bill did "not make it absolutely clear that the Coast Guard regulation of vessels preempts state action in this field," and says that \xc2\xa7 1222(b) was amended to provide "a positive statement retaining State jurisdiction over structures and making clear that State regulation of vessels is not contemplated."  House Report 15.</p>\n<p>Relying on the legislative history, the appellants argue that the preclusive effect of \xc2\xa7 1222(b) is restricted to vessel equipment requirements.  The statute, however, belies this argument, for it expressly reaches vessel "safety standards," as well as equipment.  A limitation on vessel size would seem to fall squarely within the category of safety standards, since the Secretary\'s authority to impose size limits on vessels navigating Puget Sound is designed to prevent damage to vessels and to the navigable waters. and is couched in terms of controlling vessel traffic in areas "which he determines to be especially hazardous."</p>\n<p>The pertinent inquiry at this point thus becomes whether the Secretary, through his delegate, has addressed and acted upon the question of size limitations.  Appellees and the United States insist that he has done so by his local navigation rule with respect to Rosario Strait:  the rule prohibits the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait in either direction at any given time, and in periods of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 435 U. S. 175</a></p><p> bad weather, the "size limitation" is reduced to approximately 40,000 DWT.  On the record before us, it appears sufficiently clear that federal authorities have indeed dealt with the issue of size, and have determined whether and in what circumstances tanker size is to limit navigation in Puget Sound.  The Tanker Law purports to impose a general ban on large tankers, but the Secretary\'s response has been a much more limited one.  Because, under \xc2\xa7 1222(b), the State may not impose higher safety standards than those prescribed by the Secretary under Title I, the size limitation of \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(1) may not be enforced.</p>\n<p>There is also force to the position of appellees and the United States that the size regulation imposed by the Tanker Law, if not preempted under Title I, is similar to or indistinguishable from a design requirement which Title II reserves to the federal regime.  This may be true if the size limit represents a state judgment that, as a matter of safety and environmental protection generally, tankers should not exceed 125,000 DWT.  In that event, the State should not be permitted to prevail over a contrary design judgment made by federal authorities in pursuit of uniform national and international goals.  On the other hand, if Washington\'s exclusion of large tankers from Puget Sound is, in reality, based on water depth in Puget Sound or on other local peculiarities, the Tanker Law in this respect would appear to be within the scope of Title I, in which event also state and federal law would represent contrary judgments, and the state limitation would have to give way. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Our conclusion as to the State\'s ban on large tankers is consistent with the legislative history of Title I.  In exercising his authority under the Title, the Secretary is directed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 435 U. S. 176</a></p><p> to consult.with other agencies in order "to assure consistency of regulations . . . ," \xc2\xa7 1222(c), and also to "consider fully the wide variety of interests which may be affected. . . ."  \xc2\xa7 1222(e).  These twin themes -- consistency of regulation and thoroughness of consideration -- reflect the substance of the Committee Reports.  The House Report indicates that a good number of the witnesses who testified before the House subcommittee stated that one of the strong points of Title I was</p>\n<p>"the imposition of federal control in the areas envisioned by the bill which will insure regulatory and enforcement uniformity throughout all the covered areas."</p>\n<p>House Report 8. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Such a view was expressed by the Commandant of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 435 U. S. 177</a></p><p> Coast Guard, Admiral Bender, who pointed out that, with a federally operated traffic system, the necessary research and development could be carried out by a single authority, and then utilized around the country "with differences applied . . . to the particular ports. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  He added that the same agency of the Federal Government that developed the traffic systems should then be responsible for enforcing them.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>While the House Report notes the importance of uniformity of regulation and enforcement, the Senate Report stresses the careful consideration that the Secretary must give to various factors before exercising his authority under Title I.  It states that the Secretary</p>\n<p>"is required to balance a number of considerations, including the scope and degree of hazard, vessel traffic characteristics, conditions peculiar to a particular port or waterway, environmental factors, economic impact, and so forth."</p>\n<p>Senate Report 34.  It was also</p>\n<p>"anticipated that the exercise of the authority provided . . . regarding the establishment of vessels size and speed limitations [would] not be imposed universally, but rather [would] be exercised with due consideration to the factors"</p>\n<p>set forth above, and with due regard for</p>\n<p>"such matters as combinations of horsepower, drafts of vessels, rivers, depth and width of channels, design types of vessels involved, and other relevant circumstances."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 33.</p>\n<p>We read these statements by Congress as indicating that it desired someone with an overview of all the possible ramifications of the regulation of oil tankers to promulgate limitations on tanker size, and that he should act only after balancing all of the competing interests.  While it was not anticipated that the final product of this deliberation would be the promulgation of traffic safety systems applicable across the board to all United States ports, it was anticipated that there would be a single decisionmaker, rather than a different one in each State.</p>\n<p>Against this background, we think the preemptive impact </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 435 U. S. 178</a></p><p> of \xc2\xa7 1222(b) is an understandable expression of congressional intent.  Furthermore, even without \xc2\xa7 1222(b), we would be reluctant to sustain the Tanker Law\'s absolute ban on tankers larger than 125,00 DWT.  The Court has previously recognized that</p>\n<p>"where failure of . . . federal officials affirmatively to exercise their full authority takes on the character of a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to the policy of the statute,"</p>\n<p>States are not permitted to use their police power to enact such a regulation.  <em>Bethehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/767/case.html">330 U.

Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/605/case.html">272 U. S. 605</a></span> (1928).  We think that, in this case, the Secretary\'s failure to promulgate a ban on the operations of oil tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT in Puget Sound takes on such a character.  As noted above, a clear policy of the statute is that the Secretary shall carefully consider "the wide variety of interests which may be affected by the exercise of his authority," \xc2\xa7 1222(e), and that he shall restrict the application of vessel size limitations to those areas where they are particularly necessary.  In the case of Puget Sound, the Secretary has exercised his authority in accordance with the statutory directives, and has promulgated a vessel traffic control system which contains only a narrow limitation on the operation of supertankers.  This being the case, we conclude that Washington is precluded from enforcing the size limitation contained in the Tanker Law.

S. 179</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>We also reject appellees\' additional constitutional challenges to the State\'s tug escort requirement for vessels not satisfying its design standards. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Appellees contend that this provision, even if not preempted by the PWSA, violates the Commerce Clause because it is an indirect attempt to regulate the design and equipment of tankers, an area of regulation that appellees contend necessitates a uniform national rule.  We have previously rejected this claim, concluding that the provision may be viewed as simply a tug escort requirement, since it does not have the effect of forcing compliance with the design specifications set forth in the provision.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F25" name="T25">n</a> 25, <em>supra.</em>  So viewed, it become apparent that the Commerce Clause does not prevent a State from enacting a regulation of this type.  Similar in its nature to a local pilotage requirement, a requirement that a vessel take on a tug escort when entering a particular body of water is not the type of regulation that demands a uniform national rule.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/53/299/case.html">Cooley v. Board of Wardens,</a></span></em> 12 How. 299 (1852).  Nor does it appear from the record that the requirement impedes the free and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 435 U. S. 180</a></p><p> efficient flow of interstate and foreign commerce, for the cost of tug escort for a 120,000 DWT tanker is less than one cent per barrel of oil, and the amount of oil processed at Puget Sound refineries has not declined as a result of the provision\'s enforcement.  App. 68.  Accordingly, we hold that \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) of the Tanker Law is not invalid under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we cannot agree with the additional claim that the tug escort provision interferes with the Federal Government\'s authority to conduct foreign affairs.  Again, appellees\' argument is based on the contention that the overall effect of \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) is to coerce tanker owners into outfitting their vessels with the specified design requirements.  Were that so, we might agree that the provision constituted an invalid interference with the Federal Government\'s attempt to achieve international agreement on the regulation of tanker design.  The provision as we view it, however, does no more than require the use of tug escorts within Puget Sound, a requirement with insignificant international consequences.  We, therefore, decline to declare \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) invalid for either of the additional reasons urged by appellees.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the three-judge District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It s so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Puget Sound is an estuary consisting of 2,500 square miles of inlets, bays, and channels in the northwestern part of Washington.

In that case, we sustained the state regulation against claims of preemption, but we did not rely solely on the statutory reference to "minimum standards" or indicate that it furnished a litmus paper test for resolving issues of preemption.  Indeed, there were other provisions in the Federal Act in question that "militate[d] even more strongly against federal displacement of [the] state regulations."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#148">373 U.

That Act based the President\'s authority to promulgate rules governing the operation and inspection of vessels upon his determination that the country\'s national security was endangered.  H.R.Rep.

The House Committee that considered Title I of the PWSA intended it to broaden the Coast Guard\'s authority to establish rules for port safety and protection of the environment.  The Committee Report states:</p>\n<p>"The enactment of H.R. 8140 would serve an important dual purpose.

Appellees submit letters or other evidence indicating that the local Coast Guard authorities have required tug escorts for carriers of liquefied petroleum gas and on one occasion for another type of vessel.  This evidence is not part of the record before us; but even accepting it, we cannot say that federal authorities have settled upon whether and in what circumstances tug escorts for oil tankers in Puget Sound should be required.  The entire subject of tug escorts has been placed on the Secretary\'s agenda, seemingly for definitive action, by the notice of proposed rulemaking referred to in the text.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>In fact, at the time of trial, all tankers entering Puget Sound were required to have a tug escort, for no tanker then afloat had all of the design features required by the Tanker Law.

The cost of tug escorts for all of appellee ARCO\'s tankers in Puget Sound is estimated at $277,500 per year.  While not a negligible amount, it is only a fraction of the estimated cost of outfitting a single tanker with the safety features required by \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2).  The Office of Technology Assessment of Congress has estimated that constructing a new tanker with a double bottom and twin screws, just two of the required features, would add roughly $8.8 million to the cost of a 150,000 DWT tanker.  Thus, contrary to the appellees\' contention, it is very doubtful that the provision will pressure tanker operators into complying with the design standards specified in \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2).  While the tug provision may be viewed as a penalty for noncompliance with the State\'s design requirements, it does not "stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."  <em>Hines v.

S. 181</a></p><p> utilize tug escorts while operating in Puget Sound, \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2); and (3) a size limitation, barring tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT from the Sound, \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(1).</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the pilotage requirement is preempted only with respect to enrolled vessels.  I also agree that the tug escort requirement is fully valid, at least until such time as the Secretary of Transportation or his delegate promulgates a federal tug escort rule or decides, after full consideration, that no such rule is necessary.  I therefore join Parts I, II, III, V, and VII of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>In the current posture of this case, however, I see no need to speculate, as the Court does, on the validity of the safety features alternative to the tug requirement.  Since the effective date of the Tanker Law, all tankers -- including those owned or chartered by appellees -- have employed tug escorts rather than attempting to satisfy the alternative safety requirements.  The relative expense of compliance, moreover, makes it extremely unlikely, at least for the foreseeable future, that any tankers will be constructed or redesigned to meet the law\'s requirements. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Indeed, the Court itself concludes that \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2)</p>\n<p>"may be viewed as simply a tug escort requirement, since it does not have the effect of forcing compliance with the design specifications set forth in the provision."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#179">435 U.

To reach this conclusion, the Court relies primarily on an analysis of Title I of the PWSA and the Secretary of Transportation\'s actions thereunder.  I agree with the Court that the Secretary has authority to establish vessel size limitations based on the characteristics of particular waters, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and that a State is not free to impose more stringent requirements once the Secretary has exercised that authority or has decided, after balancing all of the relevant factors, that a size limitation would not be appropriate.  On the other hand, Title I does not, by its own force, preempt all state regulation of vessel size, since it "merely authorizes, and does not require, the Secretary to issue regulations to implement the provisions of the Title."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#171">435 U.

The Court concludes that the Secretary\'s delegate, the Coast Guard, has in fact considered the issue of size limitations for Puget Sound and reached a judgment contrary to the one embodied in the Tanker Law.  Under well established principles, however, state law should be displaced "<em>only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of\'" </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 435 U.

Viewed in light of these principles, the record simply does not support the Court\'s finding of conflict between state and federal law.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Coast Guard\'s unwritten "local navigation rule," which prohibits passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait at any given time, is the sole evidence cited by the Court to show that size limitations for Puget Sound have been considered by federal authorities.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#174">435 U. S. 174</a></span>-175.  On this record, however, the rule cannot be said to reflect a determination that the size limitations set forth in the Tanker Law are inappropriate or unnecessary.  First, there is no indication that, in establishing the vessel traffic rule for Rosario Strait, the Coast Guard considered the need for promulgating size limitations for the entire Sound. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Second, even assuming that the Rosario Strait rule resulted from consideration of the size issue with respect to the entire area, appellees have not demonstrated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 435 U. S. 184</a></p><p> that the rule evinces a judgment contrary to the provisions of the Tanker Law.  Under the express terms of the PWSA, the existence of local vessel traffic control schemes must be weighed in the balance in determining whether, and to what extent, federal size limitations should be imposed. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  There is no evidence in the record that the Rosario Strait "size limitation" was in existence or even under consideration prior to passage of the Tanker Law. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Thus, appellees have left unrebutted the inference that the Coast Guard\'s own limited rule was built upon, and is therefore entirely consistent with, the framework already created by the Tanker Law\'s restrictions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in recognition of the tenuousness of its finding of conflict with federal regulation under Title I, the Court suggests that the size limitation imposed by the Tanker Law might also be preempted under Title II of the PWSA.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#175">435 U. S. 175</a></span>.  In particular, the Court theorizes that the state rule might be preempted if it "represents a state judgment that, as a matter of safety and environmental protection <em>generally,</em> tankers should not exceed 125,000 DWT."  <em>Ibid.</em>  (Emphasis added.)  It is clear, however, that the Tanker Law was not merely a reaction to the problems arising out of tanker operations in general, but instead was a measure tailored to respond to unique local conditioning -- in particular, the unusual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 435 U. S. 185</a></p><p> susceptibility of Puget Sound to damage from large oil spills and the peculiar navigational problems associated with tanker operations in the Sound. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Thus, there is no basis for preemption under Title II. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 435 U. S. 186</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For similar reasons, I would hold that Washington\'s size regulation does not violate the Commerce Clause.  Since water depth and other navigational conditions vary from port to port, local regulation of tanker access -- like pilotage and tug requirements, and other harbor and river regulation -- is certainly appropriate, and perhaps even necessary, in the absence of determinative federal action.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/53/299/case.html">53 U.

[<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Consequently, it is clear that appellees have not carried their burden of showing that the provision\'s impact on interstate or foreign commerce "is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits."  <em>Pike v.

Neither Atlantic Richfield nor Seatrain has plans to modify any tankers currently in operation to satisfy the design standards, "because such retrofit is not economically feasible under current and anticipated market conditions."  App. 67.  Moreover, the vessels being constructed by Seatrain will not meet the majority of the design requirements, and, as the Court convincingly demonstrates, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#173">435 U.

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The federal interest in uniform regulation of commerce on the high seas, reinforced by the Supremacy Clause, "dictates that the federal judgment that a vessel is safe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#165">435 U.

S. 188</a></p><p> an oil tanker of 40,000 to 125,000 deadweight tons cannot safely navigate in Puget Sound unless it possesses the "standard safety features" prescribed by \xc2\xa7 88.16.190(2) of the Washington Code. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  As the Court holds, the state statute imposing those design requirements is invalid.  It follows, I believe, that the State may not impose any special restrictions on vessels which do not satisfy these invalid criteria.</p>\n<p>The Court correctly holds that the State may not exclude vessels in that category from Puget Sound but it inconsistently allows the State to impose a costly tug escort requirement on those vessels and no others.  This tug escort requirement is not, by its terms, a general safety rule from which tankers are exempt if they possess the invalid design features.

The federal interest that prohibits state enforcement of those requirements should also prohibit state enforcement of a special penalty for failure to comply with them.</p>\n<p>If the federal interest in uniformity is to be vindicated, the magnitude of the special burden imposed by any one State\'s attempt to penalize noncompliance with its invalid rules is of no consequence.  The tug escort penalty imposed by Washington will cost appellee ARCO approximately $277,500 per year.  The significance of that cost cannot be determined simply by comparison with the capital investment which would be involved in complying with Washington\'s invalid design specifications.  Rather, it should be recognized that this initial burden is subject to addition and multiplication by similar action in other States. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Moreover, whether or not so multiplied, the imposition of any special restriction impairs the congressional determination to provide uniform standards for vessel design and construction.

S. 173</a></span>, seems to characterize the tug escort requirement as such a "general rule."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The possibility of States\' enacting legislation similar to Washington\'s is not remote.  Alaska has enacted legislation requiring payment of a "risk charge" by vessels that do not conform to state design requirements, Alaska Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 30.20.010 <em>et seq.</em> (Sept.1977), and California is considering comparable legislation.  <em>See</em> Brief for State of California <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3 n. 2.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/4" name="F3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>No matter how small the cost in the individual case, the State\'s effort here to enforce its general determinations on vessel safety must be viewed as an "obstacle" to the attainment of Congress\' objective of providing comprehensive standards for vessel design.  <em>See Hines v. Davidowitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html">312 U. S. 52</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/case.html#67">312 U. S. 67</a></span>.  This does not mean that the State cannot adopt any general rules imposing tug escort requirements, but it does mean that it cannot condition those requirements on safety determinations that are preempted by federal law, thus "impos[ing] additional burdens not contemplated by Congress."  <em>De Canas v. Bica,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/351/case.html">424 U. S. 351</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/351/case.html#358">424 U. S. 358</a></span> n. 6.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The validity of Washington\'s tug escort provision may be short-lived, despite today\'s opinion.  The Secretary is now contemplating regulations in this area, and even the majority concedes that they may preempt the State\'s regulation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#172">435 U. S. 172</a></span>.  While this lessens the impact of the State\'s regulation and the threat it poses to the federal scheme, the legal issue is not affected by the imminence of agency action.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
