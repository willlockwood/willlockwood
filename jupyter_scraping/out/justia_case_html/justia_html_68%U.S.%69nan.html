And in that case it is true the district court could have granted a new trial at its discretion.</p>\n<p>The 24th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 governs the practice in cases brought up and reviewed in this Court.  It is bound to give such judgment as the court below ought to have given, and the law directs that a mandate shall be sent down to have the judgment entered as final in the lower courts, when it is for the defendant below, as here.  The district court had no power to set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court, its authority extending only to executing the mandate. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>We order that a writ of mandamus do issue to the Circuit Court of the District of Iowa commanding it to vacate and erase the order granting a new trial in the aforesaid cause, and that a judgment be entered in conformity to the mandate of this Court.</p>\n<p><em>Order accordingly.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/64/66/case.html">Dubuque &amp; Pacific Railroad v.
