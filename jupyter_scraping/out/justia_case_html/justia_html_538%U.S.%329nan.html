Petitioners filed this suit against respondent, the Commissioner of Kentucky\'s Department of Insurance, asserting that the AWP laws are pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which pre-empts all state laws "insofar as they ... relate to any employee benefit plan," 29 U.

We granted certiorari to decide whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) pre-empts either, or both, of these "Any Willing Provider" (AWP) statutes.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Petitioners include several health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and a Kentucky-based association of HMOs. In order to control the quality and cost of health-care delivery, these HMOs have contracted with selected doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers to create exclusive "provider networks." Providers in such networks agree to render health-care services to the HMOs\' subscribers at discounted rates and to comply with other contractual requirements. In return, they receive the benefit of patient volume higher than that achieved by nonnetwork providers who lack access to petitioners\' subscribers.</p><p>Kentucky\'s AWP statutes impair petitioners\' ability to limit the number of providers with access to their networks, and thus their ability to use the assurance of high patient volume as the <i>quid pro quo </i>for the discounted rates that network membership entails. Petitioners believe that AWP laws will frustrate their efforts at cost and quality control, and will ultimately deny consumers the benefit of their costreducing arrangements with providers.</p><p>In April 1997, petitioners filed suit against respondent, the Commissioner of Kentucky\'s Department of Insurance, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="333">333</a></p><p>of Kentucky, asserting that ERISA, 88 Stat. 832, as amended, pre-empts Kentucky\'s AWP laws. ERISA preempts all state laws "insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a), but state "law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance, banking, or securities" are saved from pre-emption, \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A). The District Court concluded that although both AWP statutes "relate to" employee benefit plans under \xc2\xa7 1144(a), each law "regulates insurance" and is therefore saved from preemption by \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A). App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a-84a. In affirming the District Court, the Sixth Circuit also concluded that the AWP laws "regulat[e] insurance" and fall within ERISA\'s saving clause. <i>Kentucky Assn. of Health Plans, Inc. </i>v. <i>Nichols, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/227/352/">227 F.3d 352</a>, 363-372 (2000). Relying on <i>UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America </i>v. <i>Ward, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/358/case.html">526 U. S. 358</a> (1999), the Sixth Circuit first held that Kentucky\'s AWP laws regulate insurance "as a matter of common sense," 227 F. 3d, at 364, because they are "specifically directed toward \'insurers\' and the insurance industry ... ," <i>id., </i>at 366. The Sixth Circuit then considered, as "checking points or guideposts" in its analysis, the three factors used to determine whether a practice fits within "the business of health insurance" in our cases interpreting the McCarran- Ferguson Act. <i>Id., </i>at 364. These factors are: <i>"first, </i>whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\'s risk; <i>second, </i>whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and <i>third, </i>whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry." <i>Union Labor Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Pireno, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/119/case.html">458 U. S. 119</a>, 129 (1982). The Sixth Circuit found all three factors satisfied. 227 F. 3d, at 368-371. Notwithstanding its analysis of the McCarran-Ferguson factors, the Sixth Circuit reiterated that the "basic test" under ERISA\'s saving clause is whether, from a commonsense view, the Kentucky AWP laws regulate insurance. <i>Id., </i>at 372.

S. 956 (2002).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>To determine whether Kentucky\'s AWP statutes are saved from pre-emption, we must ascertain whether they are "law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance" under \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A).</p><p>It is well established in our case law that a state law must be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry in order to fall under ERISA\'s saving clause; laws of general application that have some bearing on insurers do not qualify. <i>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Dedeaux, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html">481 U. S. 41</a>, 50 (1987); see also <i>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. </i>v. <i>Moran, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/case.html">536 U.

At the same time, not all state laws "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry will be covered by \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A), which saves laws that regulate <i>insurance, </i>not insurers. As we explained in <i>Rush Prudential, </i>insurers must be regulated "with respect to their insurance practices," 536 U. S., at 366. Petitioners contend that Kentucky\'s AWP laws fall outside the scope of \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) for two reasons. First, because Kentucky has failed to "specifically direc[t]" its AWP laws toward the insurance industry; and second, because the A WP laws do not regulate an insurance practice. We find neither contention persuasive.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Petitioners claim that Kentucky\'s statutes are not "specifically directed toward" insurers because they regulate not only the insurance industry but also doctors who seek to form and maintain limited provider networks with HMOs. That is to say, the AWP laws equally prevent <i>providers </i>from entering into limited network contracts with <i>insurers, </i>just as they prevent insurers from creating exclusive networks in the first place. We do not think it follows that Kentucky</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="335">335</a></p><p>has failed to specifically direct its AWP laws at the insurance industry.</p><p>Neither of Kentucky\'s AWP statutes, by its terms, imposes any prohibitions or requirements on health-care providers. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 304.17 A-270 (West 2001) (imposing obligations only on "health insurer[s]" not to discriminate against any willing provider); \xc2\xa7304.17A-171 (imposing obligations only on "health benefit planes] that includ[e] chiropractic benefits"). And Kentucky health-care providers are still capable of entering exclusive networks with insurers who conduct business outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky or who are otherwise not covered by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7304.17A-270 or 304.17 A-171. Kentucky\'s statutes are transgressed only when a "health insurer," or a "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits," excludes from its network a provider who is willing and able to meet its terms.</p><p>It is of course true that as a <i>consequence </i>of Kentucky\'s A WP laws, entities outside the insurance industry (such as health-care providers) will be unable to enter into certain agreements with Kentucky insurers. But the same could be said about the state laws we held saved from pre-emption in <i>FMC Corp. </i>and <i>Rush Prudential. </i>Pennsylvania\'s law prohibiting insurers from exercising subrogation rights against an insured\'s tort recovery, see <i>FMC Corp., supra, </i>at 55, n. 1, also prevented insureds from entering into enforceable contracts with insurers allowing subrogation. Illinois\' requirement that HMOs provide independent review of whether services are "medically necessary," <i>Rush Prudential, supra, </i>at 372, likewise excluded insureds from joining an HMO that would have withheld the right to independent review in exchange for a lower premium. Yet neither case found the effects of these laws on noninsurers, significant though they may have been, inconsistent with the requirement that laws saved from pre-emption by \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry. Regulations "directed toward" certain entities will almost always disable</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="336">336</a></p><p>336 KENTUCKY ASSN. OF HEALTH PLANS, INC. <i>v. </i>MILLER</p><p>other entities from doing, with the regulated entities, what the regulations forbid; this does not suffice to place such regulation outside the scope of ERISA\'s saving clause.1</p><p>1 Petitioners also contend that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 304.17 A-270 (West 2001) is not "specifically directed toward" insurers because it applies to "self-insurer or multiple employer welfare arrangement[s] not exempt from state regulation by ERISA." \xc2\xa7 304. 17A-005(23). We do not think \xc2\xa7 304. 17A-270\'s application to self-insured non-ERISA plans forfeits its status as a "law ... which regulates insurance" under 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A). ERISA\'s saving clause does not require that a state law regulate "insurance <i>companies" </i>or even <i>"the business of insurance" </i>to be saved from pre-emption; it need only be a "law ... which regulates <i>insurance," ibid. </i>(emphasis added), and self-insured plans engage in the same sort of risk pooling arrangements as separate entities that provide insurance to an employee benefit plan. Any contrary view would render superfluous ERISA\'s "deemer clause," \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(B), which provides that an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA may not "be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer ... or to be engaged in the business of insurance ... for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts .... " That clause has effect only on state laws saved from pre-emption by \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) that would, in the absence of \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(B), be allowed to regulate self-insured employee benefit plans. Under petitioners\' view, such laws would never be saved from pre-emption in the first place. (The deemer clause presents no obstacle to Kentucky\'s law, which reaches only those employee benefit plans "not exempt from state regulation by ERISA.")</p><p>Both of Kentucky\'s AWP laws apply to all HMOs, including HMOs that do not act as insurers but instead provide only administrative services to self-insured plans. Petitioners maintain that the application to noninsuring HMOs forfeits the laws\' status as "law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance." \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A). We disagree. To begin with, these noninsuring HMOs would be administering self-insured plans, which we think suffices to bring them within the activity of insurance for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A).

Kentucky\'s AWP laws operate in a similar manner with respect to the insurance industry: Those who wish to provide health insurance in Kentucky (any "health insurer") may not discriminate against any willing provider. This "regulates" insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance; whether or not an HMO\'s contracts with providers constitute "the business of insurance" under <i>Royal Drug </i>is beside the point.</p><p>We emphasize that conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance must also substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured to be covered by ERISA\'s saving clause.

A state law requiring all insurance companies to pay their janitors twice the minimum wage would not "regulate insurance," even though it would be a prerequisite to engaging in the business of insurance, because it does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement undertaken by insurer and insured. Petitioners contend that Kentucky\'s A WP statutes fail this test as well, since they do not alter or affect the terms of insurance policies, but concern only the relationship between insureds and third-party providers, Brief for Petitioners 29. We disagree. We have never held that state laws must alter or control the actual terms of insurance policies to be deemed "laws ... which regulat[e] insurance" under \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A); it suffices that they substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between insurer and insured.

In determining whether certain practices constitute "the <i>business of </i>insurance" under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (emphasis added), our cases have looked to three factors: <i>"first, </i>whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\'s risk; <i>second, </i>whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and <i>third, </i>whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry." <i>Pireno, </i>458 U.

See <i>supra, </i>at 337-338. The noticeprejudice rule governs whether or not an insurance company must cover claims submitted late, which dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk that it has assumed.

That is unsurprising, since the statutory language of \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) differs substantially from that of the McCarran- Ferguson Act. Rather than concerning itself with whether certain practices constitute "[t]he business of insurance," 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1012(a), or whether a state law was "enacted ... <i>for the purpose of </i>regulating the business of insurance," \xc2\xa7 1012(b) (emphasis added), 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) asks merely whether a state law is a "law ... which regulates insurance, banking, or securities." What is more, the McCarran- Ferguson factors were developed in cases that characterized <i>conduct </i>by private actors, not state laws. See <i>Pireno, supra, </i>at 126 ("The only issue before us is <i>whether petitioners\' peer review practices </i>are exempt from antitrust scrutiny as part of the \'business of insurance\'" (emphasis added)); <i>Royal Drug, </i>440 U.

Maya state law satisfy <i>any </i>two of the three McCarran- Ferguson factors and still fall under the saving clause? Just one? What happens if two of three factors are satisfied, but not "securely satisfied" or "clearly satisfied," as they were in <i>UNUM </i>and <i>Rush Prudential? </i>526 U. S., at 374; 536 U. S., at 373. Further confusion arises from the question whether the <i>state law itself </i>or the <i>conduct regulated by that law </i>is the proper subject to which one applies the McCarran-Ferguson factors.
