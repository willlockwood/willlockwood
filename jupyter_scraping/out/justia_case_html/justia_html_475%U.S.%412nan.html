While he was in police custody, his sister attempted to retain a lawyer to represent him.

Suffering from injuries to her skull apparently inflicted by a metal pipe found at the scene, she was rushed to a nearby hospital.  Three weeks later, she died from her wounds.</p>\n<p>Several months after her death, the Cranston, Rhode Island, police arrested respondent and two others in connection with a local burglary.  Shortly before the arrest, Detective Ferranti of the Cranston police force had learned from a confidential informant that the man responsible for Ms. Hickey\'s death lived at a certain address and went by the name of "Butch."  Upon discovering that respondent lived at that address and was known by that name, Detective Ferranti informed respondent of his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  When respondent refused to execute a written waiver, Detective Ferranti spoke separately with the two other suspects arrested on the breaking and entering charge and obtained statements further implicating respondent in Ms. Hickey\'s murder.  At approximately 6 p.m., Detective Ferranti telephoned the police in Providence to convey the information he had uncovered.  An hour later, three officers from that department arrived at the Cranston headquarters for the purpose of questioning respondent about the murder.</p>\n<p>That same evening, at about 7:45 p.m., respondent\'s sister telephoned the Public Defender\'s Office to obtain legal assistance for her brother.  Her sole concern was the breaking and entering charge, as she was unaware that respondent was then under suspicion for murder.  She asked for Richard Casparian, who had been scheduled to meet with respondent earlier that afternoon to discuss another charge unrelated to either the break-in or the murder.  As soon as the conversation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 475 U. S. 417</a></p><p> ended, the attorney who took the call attempted to reach Mr. Casparian.  When those efforts were unsuccessful, she telephoned Allegra Munson, another Assistant Public Defender, and told her about respondent\'s arrest and his sister\'s subsequent request that the office represent him.</p>\n<p>At 8:15 p.m., Ms. Munson telephoned the Cranston police station and asked that her call be transferred to the detective division.  In the words of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, whose factual findings we treat as presumptively correct, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254(d), the conversation proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p>"A male voice responded with the word \'Detectives.\'  Ms. Munson identified herself and asked if Brian Burbine was being held; the person responded affirmatively.  Ms. Munson explained to the person that Burbine was represented by attorney Casparian, who was not available; she further stated that she would act as Burbine\'s legal counsel in the event that the police intended to place him in a lineup or question him.  The unidentified person told Ms. Munson that the police would not be questioning Burbine or putting him in a lineup, and that they were through with him for the night.  Ms. Munson was not informed that the Providence Police were at the Cranston police station or that Burbine was a suspect in Mary\'s murder."</p>\n<p><em>State v. Burbine,</em> 451 A.2d 22, 23-24 (1982).  At all relevant times, respondent was unaware of his sister\'s efforts to retain counsel and of the fact and contents of Ms. Munson\'s telephone conversation.</p>\n<p>Less than an hour later, the police brought respondent to an interrogation room and conducted the first of a series of interviews concerning the murder.  Prior to each session, respondent was informed of his <em>Miranda</em> rights, and on three separate occasions he signed a written form acknowledging that he understood his right to the presence of an attorney and explicitly indicating that he "[did] not want an attorney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 475 U. S. 418</a></p><p> called or appointed for [him]" before he gave a statement.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 94, 103, 107.  Uncontradicted evidence at the suppression hearing indicated that at least twice during the course of the evening, respondent was left in a room where he had access to a telephone, which he apparently declined to use.  Tr. of Suppression Hearing 23, 85.  Eventually, respondent signed three written statements fully admitting to the murder.</p>\n<p>Prior to trial, respondent moved to suppress the statements.  The court denied the motion, finding that respondent had received the <em>Miranda</em> warnings and had "knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his privilege against self-incrimination [and] his right to counsel."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116.  Rejecting the contrary testimony of the police, the court found that Ms. Munson did telephone the detective bureau on the evening in question, but concluded that "there was no . . . conspiracy or collusion on the part of the Cranston Police Department to secrete this defendant from his attorney."  <em>Id.</em> at 114.  In any event, the court held, the constitutional right to request the presence of an attorney belongs solely to the defendant, and may not be asserted by his lawyer.  Because the evidence was clear that respondent never asked for the services of an attorney, the telephone call had no relevance to the validity of the waiver or the admissibility of the statements.</p>\n<p>The jury found respondent guilty of murder in the first degree, and he appealed to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.  A divided court rejected his contention that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution required the suppression of the inculpatory statements, and affirmed the conviction.  Failure to inform respondent of Ms. Munson\'s efforts to represent him, the court held, did not undermine the validity of the waivers.</p>\n<p>"It hardly seems conceivable that the additional information that an attorney whom he did not know had called the police station would have added significantly to the quantum of information necessary for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 475 U. S. 419</a></p><p> accused to make an informed decision as to waiver."</p>\n<p><em>State v. Burbine,</em> 451 A.2d 22, 29 (1982).  Nor, the court concluded, did <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> or any other decision of this Court independently require the police to honor Ms. Munson\'s request that interrogation not proceed in her absence.  In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that, because two different police departments were operating in the Cranston station house on the evening in question, the record supported the trial court\'s finding that there was no "conspiracy or collusion" to prevent Ms. Munson from seeing respondent.  451 A.2d at 30, n. 5.  In any case, the court held, the right to the presence of counsel belongs solely to the accused, and may not be asserted by "benign third parties, whether or not they happen to be attorneys."  <em>Id.</em> at 28.</p>\n<p>After unsuccessfully petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island for a writ of habeas corpus, 589 F.Supp. 1245 (1984), respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  That court reversed.  753 F.2d 178 (1985).  Finding it unnecessary to reach any arguments under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, the court held that the police\'s conduct had fatally tainted respondent\'s "otherwise valid" waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and right to counsel.  <em>Id.</em> at 184.  The court reasoned that, by failing to inform respondent that an attorney had called and that she had been assured that no questioning would take place until the next day, the police had deprived respondent of information crucial to his ability to waive his rights knowingly and intelligently.  The court also found that the record would support "no other explanation for the refusal to tell Burbine of Attorney Munson\'s call than . . . deliberate or reckless irresponsibility."  <em>Id.</em> at 185.  This kind of "blameworthy action by the police," the court concluded, together with respondent\'s ignorance of the telephone call, "vitiate[d] any claim that [the] waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary."  <em>Id.</em> at 185, 187. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 475 U. S. 420</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to decide whether a prearraignment confession preceded by an otherwise valid waiver must be suppressed either because the police misinformed an inquiring attorney about their plans concerning the suspect or because they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney\'s efforts to reach him.  471 U.S. 1098 (1985).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> the Court recognized that custodial interrogations, by their very nature, generate</p>\n<p>"compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\'s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#467">384 U. S. 467</a></span>.  To combat this inherent compulsion, and thereby protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, <em>Miranda</em> imposed on the police an obligation to follow certain procedures in their dealings with the accused.  In particular, prior to the initiation of questioning, they must fully apprise the suspect of the State\'s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, and must inform him of his rights to remain silent and to "have counsel present . . . if [he] so desires."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#468">384 U. S. 468</a></span>-470.  Beyond this duty to inform, <em>Miranda</em> requires that the police respect the accused\'s decision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.</p>\n<p>"If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, [or if he] states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#473">384 U.

S. 477</a></span> (1981).</p>\n<p>Respondent does not dispute that the Providence police followed these procedures with precision.  The record amply supports the state court findings that the police administered the required warnings, sought to assure that respondent understood his rights, and obtained an express written waiver prior to eliciting each of the three statements.  Nor does respondent contest the Rhode Island courts\' determination that he at no point requested the presence of a lawyer. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 475 U.

In the alternative, he suggests that, to fully protect the Fifth Amendment values served by <em>Miranda,</em> we should extend that decision to condemn the conduct of the Providence police.  We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Echoing the standard first articulated in <em>Johnson v.

First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice, rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.  Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.  Only if the "totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation" reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda</em> rights have been waived.  <em>Fare v.

The voluntariness of the waiver is not at issue.  As the Court of Appeals correctly acknowledged, the record is devoid of any suggestion that police resorted to physical or psychological pressure to elicit the statements.  753 F.2d at 184.  Indeed it appears that it was respondent, and not the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 475 U.

Arizona, supra.</em>  Nor is there any question about respondent\'s comprehension of the full panoply of rights set out in the <em>Miranda</em> warnings and of the potential consequences of a decision to relinquish them.  Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals believed that the "[d]eliberate or reckless" conduct of the police, in particular their failure to inform respondent of the telephone call, fatally undermined the validity of the otherwise proper waiver.  753 F.2d at 187.  We find this conclusion untenable as a matter of both logic and precedent.</p>\n<p>Events occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.  Under the analysis of the Court of Appeals, the same defendant, armed with the same information and confronted with precisely the same police conduct, would have knowingly waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights had a lawyer not telephoned the police station to inquire about his status.  Nothing in any of our waiver decisions or in our understanding of the essential components of a valid waiver requires so incongruous a result.  No doubt the additional information would have been useful to respondent; perhaps even it might have affected his decision to confess.  But we have never read the Constitution to require that the police supply a suspect with a flow of information to help him calibrate his self-interest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights. <em>See, e.g., Oregon v.

Once it is determined that a suspect\'s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\'s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 475 U. S. 423</a></p><p> is complete, and the waiver is valid as a matter of law. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court of Appeals\' conclusion to the contrary was in error.</p>\n<p>Nor do we believe that the level of the police\'s culpability in failing to inform respondent of the telephone call has any bearing on the validity of the waivers.  In light of the state court findings that there was no "conspiracy or collusion" on the part of the police, 451 A.2d at 30, n. 5, we have serious doubts about whether the Court of Appeals was free to conclude that their conduct constituted "deliberate or reckless irresponsibility."  753 F.2d at 185; <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254(d).  But whether intentional or inadvertent, the state of mind of the police is irrelevant to the question of the intelligence and voluntariness of respondent\'s election to abandon his rights.  Although highly inappropriate, even deliberate deception of an attorney could not possibly affect a suspect\'s decision to waive his <em>Miranda</em> rights unless he were at least aware of the incident.  <em>Compare Escobedo v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html">378 U.

Nor was the failure to inform respondent of the telephone call the kind of "trick[ery]" that can vitiate the validity of a waiver.  <em>Miranda,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#476">384 U.

S. 424</a></em></p><p><em> matter of ethics, such conduct is only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.  Because respondent\'s voluntary decision to speak was made with full awareness and comprehension of all the information <em>Miranda</em> requires the police to convey, the waivers were valid.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>At oral argument respondent acknowledged that a constitutional rule requiring the police to inform a suspect of an attorney\'s efforts to reach him would represent a significant extension of our precedents.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33.  He contends, however, that the conduct of the Providence police was so inimical to the Fifth Amendment values <em>Miranda</em> seeks to protect that we should read that decision to condemn their behavior.  Regardless of any issue of waiver, he urges, the Fifth Amendment requires the reversal of a conviction if the police are less than forthright in their dealings with an attorney or if they fail to tell a suspect of a lawyer\'s unilateral efforts to contact him.  Because the proposed modification ignores the underlying purposes of the <em>Miranda</em> rules, and because we think that the decision as written strikes the proper balance between society\'s legitimate law enforcement interests and the protection of the defendant\'s Fifth Amendment rights, we decline the invitation to further extend <em>Miranda\'s</em> reach.</p>\n<p>At the outset, while we share respondent\'s distaste for the deliberate misleading of an officer of the court, reading <em>Miranda</em> to forbid police deception of an <em>attorney</em> "would cut [the decision] completely loose from its own explicitly stated rationale."  <em>Beckwith v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/341/case.html">425 U.

Their objective is not to mold police conduct for its own sake.  Nothing in the Constitution vests in us the authority to mandate a code of behavior for state officials wholly unconnected to any federal right or privilege.  The purpose of the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, instead, is to dissipate the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation and, in so doing, guard against abridgment of the suspect\'s Fifth Amendment rights.  Clearly, a rule that focuses on how the police treat an attorney -- conduct that has no relevance at all to the degree of compulsion experienced by the defendant during interrogation -- would ignore both <em>Miranda\'s</em> mission and its only source of legitimacy.</p>\n<p>Nor are we prepared to adopt a rule requiring that the police inform a suspect of an attorney\'s efforts to reach him.  While such a rule might add marginally to <em>Miranda\'s</em> goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, overriding practical considerations counsel against its adoption.  As we have stressed on numerous occasions, "[o]ne of the principal advantages" of <em>Miranda</em> is the ease and clarity of its application.  <em>Berkemer v. McCarty,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/case.html">468 U. S. 420</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/case.html#430">468 U. S. 430</a></span> (1984); <em>see also New York v.

We have little doubt that the approach urged by respondent and endorsed by the Court of Appeals would have the inevitable consequence of muddying <em>Miranda\'s</em> otherwise relatively clear waters.  The legal questions it would spawn are legion:  to what extent should the police be held accountable for knowing that the accused has counsel?  Is it enough that someone in the station house knows, or must the interrogating officer himself know of counsel\'s efforts to contact the suspect?  Do counsel\'s efforts to talk to the suspect concerning one criminal investigation trigger the obligation to inform the defendant before interrogation may proceed on a wholly separate matter?  We are unwilling to modify <em>Miranda</em> in a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 475 U. S. 426</a></p><p> manner that would so clearly undermine the decision\'s central</p>\n<p>"virtue of informing police and prosecutors with specificity . . . what they may do in conducting [a] custodial interrogation, and of informing courts under what circumstances statements obtained during such interrogation are not admissible."</p>\n<p><em>Fare v. Michael C., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/707/case.html#718">442 U. S. 718</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, problems of clarity to one side, reading <em>Miranda</em> to require the police in each instance to inform a suspect of an attorney\'s efforts to reach him would work a substantial and, we think, inappropriate shift in the subtle balance struck in that decision.  Custodial interrogations implicate two competing concerns. On the one hand, "the need for police questioning as a tool for effective enforcement of criminal laws" cannot be doubted.  <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/case.html">412 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/case.html#225">412 U. S. 225</a></span> (1973).  Admissions of guilt are more than merely "desirable," <em>United States v. Washington,</em> 431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/181/case.html#186">431 U. S. 186</a></span>; they are essential to society\'s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.  On the other hand, the Court has recognized that the interrogation process is "inherently coercive," and that, as a consequence, there exists a substantial risk that the police will inadvertently traverse the fine line between legitimate efforts to elicit admissions and constitutionally impermissible compulsion.  <em>New York v. Quarles, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html#656">467 U. S. 656</a></span>.  <em>Miranda</em> attempted to reconcile these opposing concerns by giving the <em>defendant</em> the power to exert some control over the course of the interrogation.  Declining to adopt the more extreme position that the actual presence of a lawyer was necessary to dispel the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation, <em>see</em> Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> O.T. 1965, No. 759, pp. 22-31, the Court found that the suspect\'s Fifth Amendment rights could be adequately protected by less intrusive means.  Police questioning, often an essential part of the investigatory process, could continue in its traditional form, the Court held, but only if the suspect clearly understood </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 475 U. S. 427</a></p><p> that, at any time, he could bring the proceeding to a halt or, short of that, call in an attorney to give advice and monitor the conduct of his interrogators.</p>\n<p>The position urged by respondent would upset this carefully drawn approach in a manner that is both unnecessary for the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege and injurious to legitimate law enforcement.  Because, as <em>Miranda</em> holds, full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process, a rule requiring the police to inform the suspect of an attorney\'s efforts to contact him would contribute to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege only incidentally, if at all.  This minimal benefit, however, would come at a substantial cost to society\'s legitimate and substantial interest in securing admissions of guilt.  Indeed, the very premise of the Court of Appeals was not that awareness of Ms. Munson\'s phone call would have dissipated the coercion of the interrogation room, but that it might have convinced respondent not to speak at all.  753 F.2d at 185.  Because neither the letter nor purposes of <em>Miranda</em> require this additional handicap on otherwise permissible investigatory efforts, we are unwilling to expand the <em>Miranda</em> rules to require the police to keep the suspect abreast of the status of his legal representation.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that a number of state courts have reached a contrary conclusion.  <em>Compare State v. Jones,</em> 19 Wash.App. 850, 578 P.2d 71 (1978), <em>with State v. Beck,</em> 687 S.W.2d 155 (Mo.1985) (en banc).  We recognize also that our interpretation of the Federal Constitution, if given the dissent\'s expansive gloss, is at odds with the policy recommendations embodied in the American Bar Association Standards of Criminal Justice.  <em>Cf.</em> ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 5-7.1 (2d ed.1980).  Notwithstanding the dissent\'s protestations, however, our interpretive duties go well beyond deferring to the numerical preponderance of lower court decisions or to the subconstitutional recommendations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 475 U. S. 428</a></p><p> of even so esteemed a body as the American Bar Association.  <em>See Nix v. Whiteside, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/157/case.html#189">475 U. S. 189</a></span> (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).  Nothing we say today disables the States from adopting different requirements for the conduct of its employees and officials as a matter of state law.  We hold only that the Court of Appeals erred in construing the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution to require the exclusion of respondent\'s three confessions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent also contends that the Sixth Amendment requires exclusion of his three confessions. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It is clear, of course, that, absent a valid waiver, the defendant has the right to the presence of an attorney during any interrogation occurring after the first formal charging proceeding, the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel initially attaches.  <em>United States v.

S. 478</a></span> (1964), he maintains that <em>Gouveia, Kirby,</em> and our other "critical stage" cases concern only the narrow question of when the right <em>to</em> counsel -- that is, to the appointment or presence of counsel -- attaches.  The right to noninterference with an attorney\'s dealings with a criminal suspect, he asserts, arises the moment that the relationship is formed, or, at the very least, once the defendant is placed in custodial interrogation.\n</em></p>\n<p>We are not persuaded.  At the outset, subsequent decisions foreclose any reliance on <em>Escobedo</em> and <em>Miranda</em> for the proposition that the Sixth Amendment right, in any of its manifestations, applies prior to the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings.  Although <em>Escobedo</em> was originally decided as a Sixth Amendment case,</p>\n<p>"the Court in retrospect perceived that the \'prime purpose\' of <em>Escobedo</em> was not to vindicate the constitutional right to counsel as such, but, like <em>Miranda,</em> \'to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>Kirby v. Illinois, supra,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 475 U. S. 430</a></p><p> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#689">406 U.

Clearly then, <em>Escobedo</em> provides no support for respondent\'s argument.  Nor, of course, does <em>Miranda,</em> the holding of which rested exclusively on the Fifth Amendment.  Thus, the decision\'s brief observation about the reach of <em>Escobedo\'s</em> Sixth Amendment analysis is not only dictum, but reflects an understanding of the case that the Court has expressly disavowed.  <em>See also United States v. Gouveia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/case.html#188">467 U. S. 188</a></span>, n. 5; Y. Kamisar, Police Interrogation and Confessions 217-218, n. 94 (1980).</p>\n<p>Questions of precedent to one side, we find respondent\'s understanding of the Sixth Amendment both practically and theoretically unsound.  As a practical matter, it makes little sense to say that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at different times depending on the fortuity of whether the suspect or his family happens to have retained counsel prior to interrogation.  <em>Cf. id.</em> at 220-221.  More importantly, the suggestion that the existence of an attorney-client relationship itself triggers the protections of the Sixth Amendment misconceives the underlying purposes of the right to counsel.  The Sixth Amendment\'s intended function is not to wrap a protective cloak around the attorney-client relationship for its own sake, any more than it is to protect a suspect from the consequences of his own candor.  Its purpose, rather, is to assure that, in any "criminal prosecutio[n]," U.S.Const., Amdt. 6, the accused shall not be left to his own devices in facing the "<em>prosecutorial forces of organized society.\'"  <em>Maine v. Moulton, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html#170">474 U. S. 170</a></span> (quoting <em>Kirby v.

By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government\'s role shifts from investigation to accusation.  For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the "intricacies . . . of law," <em>ibid.,</em> is needed to assure that the prosecution\'s case encounters "the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing."  <em>United States v.

S. 431</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Indeed, in <em>Maine v. Moulton,</em> decided this Term, the Court again confirmed that looking to the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings, far from being mere formalism, is fundamental to the proper application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  There, we considered the constitutional implications of a surreptitious investigation that yielded evidence pertaining to two crimes.  For one, the defendant had been indicted; for the other, he had not.  Concerning the former, the Court reaffirmed that, after the first charging proceeding, the government may not deliberately elicit incriminating statements from an accused out of the presence of counsel.  <em>See also Massiah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html">377 U. S. 201</a></span> (1964).  The Court made clear, however, that the evidence concerning the crime for which the defendant had not been indicted -- evidence obtained in precisely the same manner from the identical suspect -- would be admissible at a trial limited to those charges.  <em>Maine v. Moulton,</em> 474 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/159/case.html#180">474 U. S. 180</a></span>, and n. 16.  The clear implication of the holding, and one that confirms the teaching of <em>Gouveia,</em> is that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges.  Moreover, because Moulton already had legal representation, the decision all but forecloses respondent\'s argument that the attorney-client relationship itself triggers the Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p>Respondent contends, however, that custodial interrogations require a different rule.  Because confessions elicited during the course of police questioning often seal a suspect\'s fate, he argues, the need for an advocate -- and the concomitant right to noninterference with the attorney-client relationship -- is at its zenith, regardless of whether the State has initiated the first adversary judicial proceeding.  We do not doubt that a lawyer\'s presence could be of value to the suspect; and we readily agree that, if a suspect confesses, his attorney\'s case at trial will be that much more difficult.  But these concerns are no more decisive in this context than they were for the equally damaging preindictment lineup </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 475 U.

For an interrogation, no more or less than for any other "critical" pretrial event, the possibility that the encounter may have important consequences at trial, standing alone, is insufficient to trigger the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  As <em>Gouveia</em> made clear, until such time as the "<em>government has committed itself to prosecute, and . . . the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified,\'" the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach.  467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/case.html#189">467 U.

Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U.

When a suspect <em>has</em> requested counsel, the interrogation must cease, regardless of any question of waiver, unless the suspect himself initiates the conversation.  In the course of its lengthy exposition, however, the dissent never comes to grips with the crucial distinguishing feature of this case -- that Burbine at no point requested the presence of counsel, as was his right under <em>Miranda</em> to do.  We do not quarrel with the dissent\'s characterization of police interrogation as a "privilege terminable at the will of the suspect."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#458">475 U. S. 458</a></span>.  We reject, however, the dissent\'s entirely undefended suggestion that the Fifth Amendment "right to counsel" requires anything more than that the police inform the suspect of his right to representation and honor his request that the interrogation cease until his attorney is present.  <em>See, e.g., Michigan v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html">423 U. S. 96</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#104">423 U.

Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider whether a waiver for one purpose necessarily operates as a general waiver of the right to counsel for all purposes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the Rhode Island Supreme Court\'s finding that, as a matter of state law, no attorney-client relationship existed between respondent and Ms. Munson, the Sixth Amendment issue is properly before us.  <em>State v. Burbine,</em> 461 A.2d 22, 29 (1982).  Petitioner now concedes that such a relationship existed, and invites us to decide the Sixth Amendment question based on that concession.  Of course, a litigant\'s concession cannot be used to circumvent the rule that this Court may not disregard a state court\'s interpretation of state law.  Respondent\'s argument, however, does not focus on whether an attorney-client relationship actually existed as a formal matter of state law.  He argues instead that, on the particular facts of this case, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been violated.  In any event, even if the existence of an attorney-client relationship could somehow independently trigger the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a position we reject, the type of circumstances that would give rise to the right would certainly have a federal definition.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Among its other failings, the dissent declines to follow <em>Oregon v. Elstad,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html">470 U. S. 298</a></span> (1986), a decision that categorically forecloses JUSTICE STEVENS\' major premise -- that <em>Miranda</em> requires the police to inform a suspect of any and all information that would be useful to a decision whether to remain silent or speak with the police.  <em>See also United States v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/181/case.html">431 U. S. 181</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/181/case.html#188">431 U. S. 188</a></span> (1977).  The dissent also launches a novel "agency" theory of the Fifth Amendment under which any perceived deception of a lawyer is automatically treated as deception of his or her client.  This argument entirely disregards the elemental and established proposition that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is, by hypothesis, a personal one that can only be invoked by the individual whose testimony is being compelled.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the dissent\'s misreading of <em>Miranda</em> itself is breathtaking in its scope.  For example, it reads <em>Miranda</em> as creating an undifferentiated right to the presence of an attorney that is triggered automatically by the initiation of the interrogation itself.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#463">475 U. S. 463</a></span>.  Yet, as both <em>Miranda</em> and subsequent decisions construing <em>Miranda</em> make clear beyond refute, "<em>the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present\' <em>only</em> `[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney.\'"  <em>Michigan v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html">423 U. S. 96</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#104">423 U.

The dissent condemns us for embracing "incommunicado questioning . . . as a societal goal of the highest order that justifies police deception of the shabbiest kind."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#439">475 U. S. 439</a></span>.  We, of course, do nothing of the kind.  As any reading of <em>Miranda</em> reveals, the decision, rather than proceeding from the premise that the rights and needs of the defendant are paramount to all others, embodies a carefully crafted balance designed to fully protect <em>both</em> the defendant\'s and society\'s interests.  The dissent may not share our view that the Fifth Amendment rights of the defendant are amply protected by application of <em>Miranda as written.</em>  But the dissent is "simply wrong," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#452">475 U. S. 452</a></span>, in suggesting that exclusion of Burbine\'s three confessions follows perfunctorily from <em>Miranda\'s</em> mandate.  Y. Kamisar, Police Interrogation and Confessions 217-218, n. 94 (1980).\n</em></p>\n<p>Quite understandably, the dissent is outraged by the very idea of police deception of a lawyer.  Significantly less understandable is its willingness to misconstrue this Court\'s constitutional holdings in order to implement its subjective notions of sound policy.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case poses fundamental questions about our system of justice.  As this Court has long recognized, and reaffirmed only weeks ago, "ours is an accusatorial, and not an inquisitorial, system."  <em>Miller v. Fenton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html">474 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html#110">474 U. S. 110</a></span> (1985). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The Court\'s opinion today represents a startling departure from that basic insight. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 475 U. S. 435</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the police may deceive an attorney by giving her false information about whether her client will be questioned, and that the police may deceive a suspect by failing to inform him of his attorney\'s communications and efforts to represent him. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  For the majority, this conclusion, though "distaste[ful]," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#424">475 U. S. 424</a></span>, is not even debatable.  The deception of the attorney is irrelevant, because the attorney has no right to information, accuracy, honesty, or fairness in the police response to her questions about her client.  The deception of the client is acceptable, because, although the information would affect the client\'s assertion of his rights, the client\'s actions in ignorance of the availability of his attorney are voluntary, knowing, and intelligent; additionally, society\'s interest in apprehending, prosecuting, and punishing criminals outweighs the suspect\'s interest in information regarding his attorney\'s efforts to communicate with him.  Finally, even mendacious police interference in the communications between a suspect and his lawyer does not violate any notion of fundamental fairness, because it does not shock the conscience of the majority.</p>\n<p>The case began in March, 1977, with the discovery of Mary Jo Hickey, unconscious and disheveled in a deserted parking lot, lying in a pool of blood, with semen on her clothes, her dentures broken, and a piece of heavy, bloodstained metal nearby.  Days later, Brian Burbine, then 20 years old, went to Maine and stayed with friends.  According to the friends\' testimony at trial, he was upset, and described a night out with Hickey, who was then 35.  After several drinks, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 475 U. S. 436</a></p><p> Burbine told them, a ride home turned into a violent encounter; he hit Hickey several times and threw her out of the car.  Three weeks after she was discovered in the parking lot, Hickey died.  Three months later, after the 21-hour period of detention by the Cranston and Providence, Rhode Island, police that is the focus of this dispute, Burbine was charged with her murder, and ultimately found guilty of it.</p>\n<p>The murder of Mary Jo Hickey was a vicious crime, fully meriting a sense of outrage and a desire to find and prosecute the perpetrator swiftly and effectively.  Indeed, by the time Burbine was arrested on an unrelated breaking-and-entering charge, the Hickey murder had been the subject of a local television special. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Not surprisingly, Detective Ferranti, the Cranston Detective who "broke" the case, was rewarded with a special commendation for his efforts. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The recognition that ours is an accusatorial, and not an inquisitorial, system nevertheless requires that the government\'s actions, even in responding to this brutal crime, respect those liberties and rights that distinguish this society from most others.  As Justice Jackson observed shortly after his return from Nuremberg, cases of this kind present</p>\n<p>"a real dilemma in a free society . . . for the defendant is shielded by such safeguards as no system of law except the Anglo-American concedes to him. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]"</p>\n<p>Justice Frankfurter similarly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 475 U. S. 437</a></p><p> emphasized that it is "a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have been forged in controversies involving not very nice people." [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  And, almost a century and a half ago, Macaulay observed that the guilt of Titus Oates could not justify his conviction by improper methods:</p>\n<p>"That Oates was a bad man is not a sufficient excuse; for the guilty are almost always the first to suffer those hardships which are afterwards used as precedents against the innocent. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding focuses on the period after a suspect has been taken into custody and before he has been charged with an offense.  The core of the Court\'s holding is that police interference with an attorney\'s access to her client during that period is not unconstitutional.  The Court reasons that a State has a compelling interest, not simply in custodial interrogation, but in lawyer-free, incommunicado custodial interrogation.  Such incommunicado interrogation is so important that a lawyer may be given false information that prevents her presence and representation; it is so important that police may refuse to inform a suspect of his attorney\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 475 U. S. 438</a></p><p> communications and immediate availability. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  This conclusion flies in the face of this Court\'s repeated expressions of deep concern about incommunicado questioning. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Until </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 475 U. S. 439</a></p><p> today, incommunicado questioning has been viewed with the strictest scrutiny by this Court; today, incommunicado questioning is embraced as a societal goal of the highest order that justifies police deception of the shabbiest kind.</p>\n<p>It is not only the Court\'s ultimate conclusion that is deeply disturbing; it is also its manner of reaching that conclusion.  The Court completely rejects an entire body of law on the subject -- the many carefully reasoned state decisions that have come to precisely the opposite conclusion. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 475 U. S. 440</a></p><p> similarly dismisses the fact that the police deception which it sanctions quite clearly violates the American Bar Association\'s Standards for Criminal Justice [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] -- Standards which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 475 U. S. 441</a></p><p> THE CHIEF JUSTICE has described as</p>\n<p>"the single most comprehensive and probably the most monumental undertaking in the field of criminal justice ever attempted by the American legal profession in our national history, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]"</p>\n<p>and which this Court frequently finds helpful. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  And, of course, the Court dismisses the fact that the American Bar Association has emphatically endorsed the prevailing state court position, and expressed its serious concern about the effect that a contrary view -- a view, such as the Court\'s, that exalts incommunicado interrogation, sanctions police deception, and demeans the right to consult with an attorney -- will have in police stations and courtrooms throughout this Nation. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Of greatest importance, the Court misapprehends or rejects the central principles that have, for several decades, animated this Court\'s decisions concerning incommunicado interrogation. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Police interference with communications between an attorney and his client is a recurrent problem.  The factual variations in the many state court opinions condemning this interference as a violation of the Federal Constitution suggest the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 475 U. S. 442</a></p><p> variety of contexts in which the problem emerges.  In Oklahoma, police led a lawyer to several different locations while they interrogated the suspect; [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] in Oregon, police moved a suspect to a new location when they learned that his lawyer was on his way; [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] in Illinois, authorities failed to tell a suspect that his lawyer had arrived at the jail and asked to see him; [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] in Massachusetts, police did not tell suspects that their lawyers were at or near the police station. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  In all these cases, the police not only failed to inform the suspect, but also misled the attorneys.  The scenarios vary, but the core problem of police interference remains.  "Its recurrence suggests that it has roots in some condition fundamental and general to our criminal system."  <em>Watts v. Indiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/49/case.html">338 U. S. 49</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/49/case.html#57">338 U. S. 57</a></span> (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring in result).</p>\n<p>The near-consensus of state courts and the legal profession\'s Standards about this recurrent problem lends powerful support to the conclusion that police may not interfere with communications between an attorney and the client whom they are questioning.  Indeed, at least two opinions from this Court seemed to express precisely that view. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  The Court today flatly rejects that widely held view, and responds to this recurrent problem by adopting the most restrictive interpretation of the federal constitutional restraints on police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 475 U. S. 443</a></p><p> deception, misinformation, and interference in attorney-client communications.</p>\n<p>The exact reach of the Court\'s opinion is not entirely clear because, on the one hand, it indicates that more egregious forms of police deception might violate the Constitution, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#432">475 U. S. 432</a></span>, while, on the other hand, it endeavors to make its disposition of this case palatable by making findings of fact concerning the voluntariness of Burbine\'s confessions that the trial judge who heard the evidence declined to make. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Before addressing the legal issues, it therefore seems appropriate to make certain additional comments about what the record discloses concerning the incriminating statements made by Burbine during the 21-hour period that he was detained by the Cranston and Providence police on June 29 and June 30, 1977</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>As the majority points out, with respect to attorney Munson\'s telephone call, the Rhode Island Supreme Court\'s summary of factual findings provides the common ground for analysis:</p>\n<p>"At approximately 8:15 [on June 29, 1977], Ms. Munson called the Cranston police station and asked that her call be transferred to the detective division.  A male voice responded with the word \'Detectives.\'  Ms. Munson identified herself and asked if Brian Burbine was being held; the person responded affirmatively.  Ms. Munson explained to the person that Burbine was represented by attorney Casparian, who was not available; she further stated that she would act as Burbine\'s legal counsel in the event that the police intended to place him in a lineup or question him.  The unidentified person told Ms. Munson that the police would not be questioning Burbine or putting him in a lineup, and that they were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 475 U. S. 444</a></p><p> through with him for the night.  Ms. Munson was not informed that the Providence police were at the Cranston police station, or that Burbine was a suspect in Mary\'s murder.  The trial justice found as a fact that Ms. Munson did make the call, but further found that there was no collusion or conspiracy on the part of the police \'to secrete [Burbine] from his attorney. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>State v. Burbine</em>, 451 A.2d 22, 23-24 (1982). [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p>Although this paragraph accurately describes attorney Munson\'s 8:15 call, the significance of the false response to her inquiry is best understood in the context of the events that were then proceeding in the police station.  The difficulty in reconstructing some of those events illustrates the need for strict presumptions regarding the consequences of custodial interrogation -- a need this Court has repeatedly recognized. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 475 U. S. 445</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On June 27, 1977, an unidentified person advised Detective Ferranti that a man known as "Butch," who lived at 306 New York Avenue in Providence, was responsible for the death of Mary Jo Hickey.  The record does not explain why Ferranti, who was a member of the Cranston Police Force, was informed about a crime that occurred in Providence.</p>\n<p>At about 3 p.m. on June 29, 1977, Cranston police officers apprehended respondent Burbine and two other men (DiOrio and Sparks) in "a burned-out building in the Cranston area."  S.H. 6, 180.  The three men were taken to the Cranston police station, charged with "breaking and entering," and placed in separate rooms.  After noticing that DiOrio and Burbine lived at 306 New York Avenue in Providence, Detective Ferranti talked to DiOrio and was told that Burbine was the only "Butch" at that address.  <em>Id.</em> at 146-147.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:30, Ferranti "went in the room where Burbine was" and asked him "if there was anybody that he knew by the name of Butch on the street, and he said he was the only Butch."  <em>Id.</em> at 148. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  After the brief questioning about the identity of "Butch," Detective Ferranti left Burbine in the interrogation room -- where he remained until about 9 p.m. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>] -- and interrogated DiOrio and Sparks.  They both "made damaging statements relative to Burbine\'s being involved in the murder in Providence"; Ferranti therefore "immediately contacted Providence Police."  <em>Id.</em> at 149-150.  The Providence officers -- Captain Wilson (the Chief of Detectives), Lieutenant Gannon, and Detective Trafford -- responded promptly, and arrived at the Cranston station between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 475 U. S. 446</a></p><p> 6 and 7 p.m.  Lieutenant Gannon testified that, as he drove to the Cranston police station, he knew that he might not be able to question Burbine</p>\n<p>"[i]f for some reason he didn\'t want to give me a statement, if for some reason he chose to get an attorney and the attorney informed us that he didn\'t want him to give a statement."</p>\n<p>Trial Tr. 407.</p>\n<p>After arriving at the station, the three Providence officers, as well as Ferranti and a second Cranston officer (Lieutenant Ricard), either remained in the large central room in the basement of the Cranston police station or participated in the questioning of DiOrio and Sparks in interrogation rooms adjacent to that large central room.</p>\n<p>It was at this point -- with Burbine alone in another adjacent room, with Providence police on hand, with police from two Departments questioning Sparks and DiOrio about Burbine\'s involvement in the Hickey homicide -- that attorney Munson telephoned.  Her call arrived at 8:15; she asked for "Detectives," and was told that the police "would not be questioning Burbine" and that they were "through" with him for the night.  These statements were false.  Moreover, she was not told that Burbine would be questioned about a homicide, rather than the breaking-and-entering charge on which he had been arrested, and she was not told that Providence police were at the Cranston police station preparing to question Burbine about a Providence crime.</p>\n<p>At about 9, some 45 minutes after Munson received the assurance that the police were "through" with Burbine, the officers completed their questioning of DiOrio and Sparks and were prepared to question Burbine.  There is no dispute about the fact that Burbine was brought into the central room at about 9, that all five police officers were then present, and that Burbine appeared somewhat upset and professed that he "<em>didn\'t do anything wrong.\'"  S.H. 21.  Detective Ferranti testified that this statement was in response to questions from the Providence police about the Hickey </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 475 U. S. 447</a></em></p><p><em> homicide; [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>] Lieutenant Gannon of the Providence police testified that the statement was about the Hickey homicide, but that Providence police did not question Burbine, and that they merely saw Burbine being escorted by Ferranti. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  Burbine was not told that attorney Munson had called and had asked about him; nor was he told that Munson had been informed that the police were through with him for the night.  After his protestations, Burbine was taken into another interrogation room.\n</em></p>\n<p>Detective Ferranti then went into that room and, according to the testimony of the Providence officers, spent either "ten minutes" or from "five to ten minutes" alone with Burbine. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]  The record does not tell us whether he told Burbine that Sparks and DiOrio had just given statements implicating him in the Hickey homicide.  Nor does it resolve the question whether Burbine\'s decision to confess was made <em>before</em> his session with Ferranti or <em>as a result</em> of that session.  The Court evidently makes the former assumption, for it asserts that Burbine "initiated" this encounter.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#421">475 U. S. 421</a></span>-422. However, the state courts made no finding about this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 475 U. S. 448</a></p><p> "initiation" by Burbine.  Detective Ferranti testified that Burbine banged and kicked on the door, S.H. 153-154; Lieutenant Gannon testified that he "believed" there was a knocking or some communication from Burbine, <em>id.</em> at 22, but he was "not sure."  <em>Id.</em> at 66. [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]  None of the other officers, who were apparently in the large room adjacent to Burbine\'s, corroborated this testimony by mentioning any "banging," "kicking," or other noise from Burbine\'s direction.  In all events, some minutes later, Detective Ferranti came back out of the room and indicated that Burbine wanted to talk.</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Gannon and Detective Trafford of the Providence police accompanied Detective Ferranti "back into the room."  During the period between 9:30 and 10:20 p.m., they administered <em>Miranda</em> warnings and typed out a four-page statement which Burbine signed, waiving his constitutional rights, acknowledging his responsibility for the death of Hickey, and reciting his version of that event.  Ferranti alternately testified that Burbine was "coherent" and "incoherent" at the time of this questioning.  <em>Id.</em> at 157-158;  Trial Tr.198, 208-209.  Apparently for the first time since his arrival at the station in the afternoon, the police then brought Burbine some food.  S.H. 160, Trial Tr. 205.</p>\n<p>After obtaining Burbine\'s signature on the first written statement at 10:20 p.m., the police were still not "through" with Burbine.  Burbine\'s first statement included no mention of the clothes that he had been wearing, or of a glass that was found with Hickey\'s purse a few blocks from the homicide.  Soon after the completion of the first statement, and after the Providence and Cranston officers had discussed the first statement and expressed pleasure with their success, [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 475 U. S. 449</a></p><p> Gannon, Trafford, and Ferranti again questioned Burbine.  They ascertained that he was wearing his "red toke" and "black windbreaker" at the time, and that Hickey had left the bar with a glass in hand. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  At 11:20 p.m., Burbine signed the second statement.</p>\n<p>The following morning, the officers obtained a warrant, conducted a search of Burbine\'s residence, and seized the clothing that he had described in the second statement.  In the meantime, Burbine was arraigned in Cranston court on the charge for which he had been arrested.  Still without counsel, Burbine pleaded guilty to malicious damage.  After the Cranston proceeding, Providence officers instantly arrested him for the Hickey homicide.  Trial Tr. 501.  Burbine was taken to the Providence police station, where he executed a third waiver of rights and identified the coat and jacket that the officers had seized.  Shortly after noon, Major Leyden called the Public Defender\'s Office and requested counsel for Burbine because he would be placed in a lineup.  <em>Id.</em> at 423.</p>\n<p>Thus, although there are a number of ambiguities in the record, the state court findings established (1) that attorney Munson made her call at about 8:15 p.m.; (2) that she was given false information; (3) that Burbine was not told of her </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 475 U. S. 450</a></p><p> call; and (4) that he was thereafter given the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, waived his rights, and signed three incriminating statements without receiving any advice from an attorney.  The remainder of the record underscores two points.  The first is the context of the call -- a context in which two Police Departments were on the verge of resolving a highly publicized, hauntingly brutal homicide, and in which, as Lieutenant Gannon testified, the police were aware that counsel\'s advice to remain silent might be an obstacle to obtaining a confession.  The second is the extent of the uncertainty about the events that motivated Burbine\'s decision to waive his rights.  The lawyer-free privacy of the interrogation room, so exalted by the majority, provides great difficulties in determining what actually transpired.  It is not simply the ambiguity that is troublesome; if so, the problem would be not unlike other difficult evidentiary problems.  Rather, the particularly troublesome aspect is that the ambiguity arises in the very situation -- incommunicado interrogation -- for which this Court has developed strict presumptions, and for which this Court has, in the past, imposed the heaviest burden of justification on the government.  It is in this context, and the larger context of our accusatorial system, that the deceptive conduct of the police must be evaluated.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Well-settled principles of law lead inexorably to the conclusion that the failure to inform Burbine of the call from his attorney makes the subsequent waiver of his constitutional rights invalid.  Analysis should begin with an acknowledgment that the burden of proving the validity of a waiver of constitutional rights is always on the <em>government.</em> [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>] When </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 475 U. S. 451</a></p><p> such a waiver occurs in a custodial setting, that burden is an especially heavy one because custodial interrogation is inherently coercive, [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>] because disinterested witnesses are seldom available to describe what actually happened, [<a href="#F2/34" name="T2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>] and because history has taught us that the danger of overreaching during incommunicado interrogation is so real. [<a href="#F2/35" name="T2/35">Footnote 2/35</a>]</p>\n<p>In applying this heavy presumption against the validity of waivers, this Court has sometimes relied on a case-by-case totality of the circumstances analysis. [<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>]  We have found, however, that some custodial interrogation situations require strict presumptions against the validity of a waiver.  <em>Miranda</em> established that a waiver is not valid in the absence of certain warnings.  <em>Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981), similarly established that a waiver is not valid if police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 475 U. S. 452</a></p><p> initiate questioning after the defendant has invoked his right to counsel.  In these circumstances, the waiver is invalid as a matter of law even if the evidence overwhelmingly establishes, as a matter of fact, that</p>\n<p>"a suspect\'s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew that he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\'s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction,"</p>\n<p><em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#422">475 U. S. 422</a></span>.  In light of our decision in <em>Edwards,</em> the Court is simply wrong in stating that "the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law" when these facts have been established.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#422">475 U. S. 422</a></span>-423. [<a href="#F2/37" name="T2/37">Footnote 2/37</a>]  Like the failure to give warnings and like police initiation of interrogation after a request for counsel, police deception of a suspect through omission of information regarding attorney communications greatly exacerbates the inherent problems of incommunicado interrogation, and requires a clear principle to safeguard the presumption against the waiver of constitutional rights.  As in those situations, the police deception should render a subsequent waiver invalid.</p>\n<p>Indeed, as <em>Miranda</em> itself makes clear, proof that the required warnings have been given is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition for establishing a valid waiver.  As the Court plainly stated in <em>Miranda,</em></p>\n<p>"any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.  The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 475 U. S. 453</a></p><p> Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#476">384 U. S. 476</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In this case, it would be perfectly clear that Burbine\'s waiver was invalid if, for example, Detective Ferranti had "threatened, tricked, or cajoled" Burbine in their private preconfession meeting -- perhaps by misdescribing the statements obtained from DiOrio and Sparks -- even though, under the Court\'s truncated analysis of the issue, Burbine fully understood his rights.  For <em>Miranda</em> clearly condemns threats or trickery that cause a suspect to make an unwise waiver of his rights even though he fully understands those rights.  In my opinion, there can be no constitutional distinction -- as the Court appears to draw, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#423">475 U. S. 423</a></span>-424 -- between a deceptive misstatement and the concealment by the police of the critical fact that an attorney retained by the accused or his family has offered assistance, either by telephone or in person. [<a href="#F2/38" name="T2/38">Footnote 2/38</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, the Court\'s truncated analysis, which relies in part on a distinction between deception accomplished by means of an omission of a critically important fact and deception by means of a misleading statement, is simply untenable.  If, as the Court asserts, "the analysis is at an end" as soon as the suspect is provided with enough information to have the capacity to understand and exercise his rights, I see no reason why the police should not be permitted to make the same kind of misstatements to the suspect that they are apparently allowed to make to his lawyer.  <em>Miranda,</em> however, clearly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 475 U. S. 454</a></p><p> establishes that both kinds of deception vitiate the suspect\'s waiver of his right to counsel. [<a href="#F2/39" name="T2/39">Footnote 2/39</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court notes, the question is whether the deceptive police conduct</p>\n<p>"deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#424">475 U. S. 424</a></span>.  This question has been resoundingly answered time and time again by the state courts that, with rare exceptions, [<a href="#F2/40" name="T2/40">Footnote 2/40</a>] have correctly understood the meaning of the <em>Miranda</em> opinion. [<a href="#F2/41" name="T2/41">Footnote 2/41</a>]  The majority\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 475 U. S. 455</a></p><p> blithe assertion of "no doubt" about the outcome of this case, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#421">475 U. S. 421</a></span>, simply ignores the prevailing view of the state courts that have considered this issue.  Particularly in an opinion that relies on a desire to avoid "a federal intrusion into the criminal processes of the States," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#434">475 U. S. 434</a></span>, one would expect at least some indication why, in the majority\'s view, so many state courts have been so profoundly wrong on this precise issue.  Unlike the majority, the state courts have realized that attorney communication to the police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 475 U. S. 456</a></p><p> about the client is an event that has a direct "bearing" on the knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights.  As the Oregon Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<p>"To pass up an abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer is very different from refusing to talk with an identified attorney actually available to provide at least initial assistance and advice, whatever might be arranged in the long run.  A suspect indifferent to the first offer may well react quite differently to the second."</p>\n<p><em>State v. Haynes,</em> 288 Ore. 59, 72, 602 P.2d 272, 278 (1979), <em>cert. denied,</em> 446 U.S. 945 (1980). [<a href="#F2/42" name="T2/42">Footnote 2/42</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, settled principles about construing waivers of constitutional rights and about the need for strict presumptions in custodial interrogations, as well as a plain reading of the <em>Miranda</em> opinion itself, overwhelmingly support the conclusion reached by almost every state court that has considered the matter -- a suspect\'s waiver of his right to counsel is invalid if police refuse to inform the suspect of his counsel\'s communications.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court makes the alternative argument that requiring police to inform a suspect of his attorney\'s communications to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 475 U. S. 457</a></p><p> and about him is not required because it would upset the careful "balance" of <em>Miranda.</em>  Despite its earlier notion that the attorney\'s call is an "outside event" that has "no bearing" on a knowing and intelligent waiver, the majority does acknowledge that information of attorney Munson\'s call "would have been useful to respondent," and "might have affected his decision to confess."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#422">475 U. S. 422</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/43" name="T2/43">Footnote 2/43</a>]  Thus, a rule requiring the police to inform a suspect of an attorney\'s call would have two predictable effects.  It would serve "<em>Miranda\'s</em> goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#425">475 U. S. 425</a></span>, and it would disserve the goal of custodial interrogation, because it would result in fewer confessions.  By a process of balancing these two concerns, the Court finds the benefit to the individual outweighed by the "substantial cost to society\'s legitimate and substantial interest in securing admissions of guilt."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#427">475 U. S. 427</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s balancing approach is profoundly misguided.  The cost of suppressing evidence of guilt will always make the value of a procedural safeguard appear "minimal," "marginal," or "incremental."  Indeed, the value of any trial at all seems like a "procedural technicality" when balanced against the interest in administering prompt justice to a murderer or a rapist caught redhanded.  The individual interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of error is easily discounted when the fact of guilt appears certain beyond doubt.</p>\n<p>What is the cost of requiring the police to inform a suspect of his attorney\'s call?  It would decrease the likelihood that custodial interrogation will enable the police to obtain a confession.  This is certainly a real cost, but it is the same cost that this Court has repeatedly found necessary to preserve </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 475 U. S. 458</a></p><p> the character of our free society and our rejection of an inquisitorial system.  Three examples illustrate the point.</p>\n<p>In <em>Escobedo v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html">378 U. S. 478</a></span> (1964), we excluded a confession by a defendant who had not been permitted to consult with his lawyer, and whose lawyer had not been permitted to see him.  We emphasized the "lesson of history" that our system of justice is not founded on a fear that a suspect will exercise his rights.</p>\n<p>"If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html#490">378 U. S. 490</a></span>.  In <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), we similarly stressed this character of our system, despite its "cost," by unequivocally holding that an individual has an absolute right to refuse to respond to police interrogation and to have the assistance of counsel during any questioning. [<a href="#F2/44" name="T2/44">Footnote 2/44</a>]  Thus, as a matter of law, the assumed right of the police to interrogate a suspect is no right at all; at best, it is a mere privilege terminable at the will of the suspect.  And, more recently, in <em>Dunaway v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html">442 U. S. 200</a></span> (1979), the Court corrected the long-held but mistaken view of the police that they have some sort of right to take any suspect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 475 U. S. 459</a></p><p> into custody for the purpose of questioning him, even though they may not have probable cause to arrest. [<a href="#F2/45" name="T2/45">Footnote 2/45</a>]</p>\n<p>Just as the "cost" does not justify taking a suspect into custody or interrogating him without giving him warnings simply because police desire to question him, so too the "cost" does not justify permitting police to withhold from a suspect knowledge of an attorney\'s communication, even though that communication would have an unquestionable effect on the suspect\'s exercise of his rights.  The "cost" that concerns the Court amounts to nothing more than an acknowledgment that the law enforcement interest in obtaining convictions suffers whenever a suspect exercises the rights that are afforded by our system of criminal justice.  In other words, it is the fear that an individual may exercise his rights that tips the scales of justice for the Court today.  The principle that ours is an accusatorial, not an inquisitorial, system, however, has repeatedly led the Court to reject that fear as a valid reason for inhibiting the invocation of rights.</p>\n<p>If the Court\'s cost-benefit analysis were sound, it would justify a repudiation of the right to a warning about counsel itself.  There is only a difference in degree between a presumption that advice about the immediate availability of a lawyer would not affect the voluntariness of a decision to confess and a presumption that every citizen knows that he has a right to remain silent, and therefore no warnings of any kind are needed.  In either case, the withholding of information serves precisely the same law enforcement interests.  And in both cases, the cost can be described as nothing more than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 475 U. S. 460</a></p><p> an incremental increase in the risk that an individual will make an unintelligent waiver of his rights.</p>\n<p>In cases like <em>Escobedo, Miranda,</em> and <em>Dunn,</em> the Court has viewed the balance from a much broader perspective.  In all these cases -- indeed, whenever the distinction between an inquisitorial and an accusatorial system of justice is implicated -- the law enforcement interest served by incommunicado interrogation has been weighed against the interest in individual liberty that is threatened by such practices.  The balance has never been struck by an evaluation of empirical data of the kind submitted to legislative decisionmakers -- indeed, the Court relies on no such data today.  Rather, the Court has evaluated the quality of the conflicting rights and interests.  In the past, that kind of balancing process has led to the conclusion that the police have <em>no right</em> to compel an individual to respond to custodial interrogation, and that the interest in liberty that is threatened by incommunicado interrogation is so precious that special procedures must be followed to protect it.  The Court\'s contrary conclusion today can only be explained by its failure to appreciate the value of the liberty that an accusatorial system seeks to protect.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court also argues that a rule requiring the police to inform a suspect of an attorney\'s efforts to reach him would have an additional cost:  it would undermine the "clarity" of the rule of the <em>Miranda</em> case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#425">475 U. S. 425</a></span>-426.  This argument is not supported by any reference to the experience in the States that have adopted such a rule.  The Court merely professes concern about its ability to answer three quite simple questions. [<a href="#F2/46" name="T2/46">Footnote 2/46</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 475 U. S. 461</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, the Court\'s evaluation of the interest in "clarity" is rather one-sided.  For a police officer with a printed card containing the exact text he is supposed to recite, perhaps the rule is clear.  But the interest in clarity that the <em>Miranda</em> decision was intended to serve is not merely for the benefit of the police.  Rather, the decision was also, and primarily, intended to provide adequate guidance to the person in custody who is being asked to waive the protections afforded by the Constitution. [<a href="#F2/47" name="T2/47">Footnote 2/47</a>]  Inevitably, the <em>Miranda</em> decision also serves the judicial interest in clarifying the inquiry </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 475 U. S. 462</a></p><p> into what actually transpired during a custodial interrogation. [<a href="#F2/48" name="T2/48">Footnote 2/48</a>]  Under the Court\'s conception of the interest in clarity, however, the police would presumably prevail whenever they could convince the trier of fact that a required ritual was performed before the confession was obtained.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the time attorney Munson made her call to the Cranston police station, she was acting as Burbine\'s attorney.  Under ordinary principles of agency law, the deliberate deception of Munson was tantamount to deliberate deception of her client. [<a href="#F2/49" name="T2/49">Footnote 2/49</a>]  If an attorney makes a mistake in the course of her representation of her client, the client must accept the consequences of that mistake. [<a href="#F2/50" name="T2/50">Footnote 2/50</a>]  It is equally clear that, when an attorney makes an inquiry on behalf of her client, the client is entitled to a truthful answer.  Surely the client must have the same remedy for a false representation to his lawyer that he would have if he were acting <em>pro se</em> and had propounded the question himself.</p>\n<p>The majority brushes aside the police deception involved in the misinformation of attorney Munson.  It is irrelevant to the Fifth Amendment analysis, concludes the majority, because that right is personal; it is irrelevant to the Sixth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 475 U. S. 463</a></p><p> Amendment analysis, continues the majority, because the Sixth Amendment does not apply until formal adversary proceedings have begun.</p>\n<p>In my view, as a matter of law, the police deception of Munson was tantamount to deception of Burbine himself.  It constituted a violation of Burbine\'s right to have an attorney present during the questioning that began shortly thereafter. The existence of that right is undisputed. [<a href="#F2/51" name="T2/51">Footnote 2/51</a>]  Whether the source of that right is the Sixth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, or a combination of the two is of no special importance, for I do not understand the Court to deny the existence of the right.</p>\n<p>The pertinent question is whether police deception of the attorney is utterly irrelevant to that right.  In my judgment, it blinks at reality to suggest that misinformation which prevented the presence of an attorney has no bearing on the protection and effectuation of the right to counsel in custodial interrogation.  The majority parses the role of attorney and suspect so narrowly that the deception of the attorney is of no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 475 U. S. 464</a></p><p> constitutional significance.  In other contexts, however, the Court does not hesitate to recognize an identity between the interest of attorney and accused. [<a href="#F2/52" name="T2/52">Footnote 2/52</a>]  The character of the attorney-client relationship requires rejection of the Court\'s notion that the attorney is some entirely distinct, completely severable entity, and that deception of the attorney is irrelevant to the right of counsel in custodial interrogation. [<a href="#F2/53" name="T2/53">Footnote 2/53</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 475 U. S. 465</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The possible reach of the Court\'s opinion is stunning.  For the majority seems to suggest that police may deny counsel all access to a client who is being held.  At least since <em>Escobedo v. Illinois,</em> it has been widely accepted that police may not simply deny attorneys access to their clients who are in custody.  This view has survived the recasting of <em>Escobedo</em> from a Sixth Amendment to a Fifth Amendment case that the majority finds so critically important.  That this prevailing view is shared by the police can be seen in the state court opinions detailing various forms of police deception of attorneys. [<a href="#F2/54" name="T2/54">Footnote 2/54</a>]  For, if there were no obligation to give attorneys access, there would be no need to take elaborate steps to avoid access, such as shuttling the suspect to a different location [<a href="#F2/55" name="T2/55">Footnote 2/55</a>] or taking the lawyer to different locations; [<a href="#F2/56" name="T2/56">Footnote 2/56</a>] police could simply refuse to allow the attorneys to see the suspects.  But the law enforcement profession has apparently believed, quite rightly in my view, that denying lawyers access to their clients is impermissible.  The Court today seems to assume that this view was error -- that, from the federal constitutional perspective, the lawyer\'s access is, as a question from the Court put it in oral argument, merely "a matter of prosecutorial grace."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.  Certainly, nothing in the Court\'s Fifth and Sixth Amendment analysis acknowledges that there is <em>any</em> federal constitutional bar to an absolute denial of lawyer access to a suspect who is in police custody.</p>\n<p>In sharp contrast to the majority, I firmly believe that the right to counsel at custodial interrogation is infringed by police treatment of an attorney that prevents or impedes the attorney\'s representation of the suspect at that interrogation. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 475 U. S. 466</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court devotes precisely five sentences to its conclusion that the police interference in the attorney\'s representation of Burbine did not violate the Due Process Clause.  In the majority\'s new, the due process analysis is a simple "shock the conscience" test.  Finding its conscience troubled, [<a href="#F2/57" name="T2/57">Footnote 2/57</a>] but not shocked, the majority rejects the due process challenge.</p>\n<p>In a variety of circumstances, however, the Court has given a more thoughtful consideration to the requirements of due process.  For instance, we have concluded that use of a suspect\'s post-<em>Miranda</em> warnings silence against him violates the due process requirement of fundamental fairness because such use breaches an implicit promise that "silence will carry no penalty." [<a href="#F2/58" name="T2/58">Footnote 2/58</a>]  Similarly, we have concluded that</p>\n<p>"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment. [<a href="#F2/59" name="T2/59">Footnote 2/59</a>]"</p>\n<p>We have also concluded that vindictive prosecution violates due process; [<a href="#F2/60" name="T2/60">Footnote 2/60</a>] so too does vindictive sentencing. [<a href="#F2/61" name="T2/61">Footnote 2/61</a>]  Indeed, we have emphasized that analysis of the "voluntariness" of a confession is frequently a "convenient shorthand" for reviewing objectionable police methods under the rubric of the due process requirement of fundamental fairness.

Just as the police cannot impliedly promise a suspect that his silence will not be used against him and then proceed to break that promise, so too police cannot tell a suspect\'s attorney that they will not question the suspect and then proceed to question him.  Just as the government cannot conceal from a suspect material and exculpatory evidence, so too the government cannot conceal from a suspect the material fact of his attorney\'s communication. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 475 U.

Burbine\'s attorney was given completely false information about the lack of questioning, moreover, she was not told that her client would be questioned regarding a murder charge about which she was unaware.  Burbine, in turn, was not told that his attorney had phoned and that she had been informed that he would not be questioned.  Quite simply, the Rhode Island police effectively drove a wedge between an attorney and a suspect through misinformation and omissions.</p>\n<p>The majority does not "question that on facts more egregious than those presented here police deception might rise to a level of a due process violation."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#432">475 U.

In my view, the police deception disclosed by this record plainly does rise to that level.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case turns on a proper appraisal of the role of the lawyer in our society.  If a lawyer is seen as a nettlesome obstacle to the pursuit of wrongdoers -- as in an inquisitorial society -- then the Court\'s decision today makes a good deal of sense.  If a lawyer is seen as an aid to the understanding and protection of constitutional rights -- as in an accusatorial society -- then today\'s decision makes no sense at all.</p>\n<p>Like the conduct of the police in the Cranston station on the evening of June 29, 1977, the Court\'s opinion today serves the goal of insuring that the perpetrator of a vile crime is punished.  Like the police on that June night as well, however, the Court has trampled on well-established legal principles and flouted the spirit of our accusatorial system of justice.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice Frankfurter succinctly explained the character of that distinction in his opinion in <em>Watts v.

S. 54</a></span> (1949):</p>\n<p>"Ours is the accusatorial, as opposed to the inquisitorial, system.  Such has been the characteristic of Anglo-American criminal justice since it freed itself from practices borrowed by the Star Chamber from the Continent whereby an accused was interrogated in secret for hours on end.  <em>See</em> Ploscowe, The Development of Present-Day Criminal Procedures in Europe and America, 48 Harv.L.Rev. 433, 457-458, 467-473 (1935).  Under our system, society carries the burden of proving its charge against the accused not out of his own mouth.  It must establish its case, not by interrogation of the accused, even under judicial safeguards, but by evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.  \'The law will not suffer a prisoner to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction.\'  2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 46, \xc2\xa7 34 (8th ed. 1824).  The requirement of specific charges, their proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the protection of the accused from confessions extorted through whatever form of police pressures, the right to a prompt hearing before a magistrate, the right to assistance of counsel, to be supplied by government when circumstances make it necessary, the duty to advise an accused of his constitutional rights -- these are all characteristics of the accusatorial system and manifestations of its demands.  Protracted, systematic and uncontrolled subjection of an accused to interrogation by the police for the purpose of soliciting disclosures or confession is subversive of the accusatorial system.  <em>See generally Malloy v.

In my view, for federal constitutional purposes, members of a suspect\'s family may provide a lawyer with authority to act on a suspect\'s behalf while the suspect is in custody.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Tr. of Suppression Hearing 167 (S.

The suspect neither had nor was advised of his right to get counsel.  This presents a real dilemma in a free society.  To subject one without counsel to questioning which may and is intended to convict him is a real peril to individual freedom.  To bring in a lawyer means a real peril to solution of the crime, because, under our adversary system, he deems that his sole duty is to protect his client -- guilty or innocent -- and that, in such a capacity, he owes no duty whatever to help society solve its crime problem.  Under this conception of criminal procedure, any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances."</p>\n<p>"If the State may arrest on suspicion and interrogate without counsel, there is no denying the fact that it largely negates the benefits of the constitutional guaranty of the right to assistance of counsel.  Any lawyer who has ever been called into a case after his client has \'told all\' and turned any evidence he has over to the Government knows how helpless he is to protect his client against the facts thus disclosed."</p>\n<p>"I suppose the view one takes will turn on what one thinks should be the right of an accused person against the State.  Is it his right to have the judgment on the facts?  Or is it his right to have a judgment based on only such evidence as he cannot conceal from the authorities, who cannot compel him to testify in court and also cannot question him before?  Our system comes close to the latter by any interpretation, for the defendant is shielded by such safeguards as no system of law except the Anglo-American concedes to him. Watts v.

Although a suspect is told that a lawyer will be appointed if he "cannot afford one," he may have no way of determining whether his resources are adequate to pay an attorney; even Members of this Court cannot agree when a person is too poor to pay his own legal costs.  <em>See, e.g., Pfeil v. Rogers,</em> 474 U.S. 812 (1985) (Court splits 5-4 on whether to grant petitioner leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em>); <em>Barrett v. United States Customs Service,</em> 474 U.S. 812 (1985) (same).  Similarly, although a suspect is entitled to rely on the implicit promise that his silence will not be used against him, <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/284/case.html">474 U. S. 284</a></span> (1986); <em>Doyle v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/610/case.html">426 U. S. 610</a></span> (1976), it is by no means clear that every suspect will understand that promise; many may fear that silence or a request for counsel will be construed as an admission of guilt.  <em>Cf. Griffin v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html">380 U. S. 609</a></span>, 610-611 (1965) (prosecutor argued that defendant\'s silence was probative of his guilt); App. in <em>Michigan v. Jackson,</em> O.T. 1985, No. 84-1531, pp. 157-158 (police statement to suspect) ("I think you need a brick to hit you against a wall to realize that your in serious trouble here, and that the only way that you have any hope is by us.

The standard written waiver form used by the police in this case recited:  "I have the right to the presence of an attorney prior to and during any questioning by the police."</p>\n<p>In his argument for the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> the Solicitor General advanced the remarkable suggestion that <em>Miranda\'s</em> requirement that an individual be told that he has a right to consult with counsel while in custody is "a sort of a white lie" that is "harmless" and "useful."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 21.  He contended that "police do not have to provide a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer.  They need simply terminate the interrogation."  <em>Ibid.</em>  I find this view completely untenable, and I take it that the Court\'s opinion, in today\'s sanctioning of police deception, does not in any way accept the suggestion that this Court\'s required warnings are themselves a constitutionally compelled form of deception, or "white lie."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/52" name="F2/52">Footnote 2/52</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Strickland v.

Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/297/278/case.html">297 U. S. 278</a></span> (1936), was the wellspring of this notion, now deeply embedded in our criminal law.  Faced with statements extracted by beatings and other forms of physical and psychological torture, the Court held that confessions procured by means \'revolting to the sense of justice\' could not be used to secure a conviction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/297/278/case.html#286">297 U. S. 286</a></span>.  On numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has set aside convictions secured through the admission of an improperly obtained confession. . . .

Indeed, even after holding that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies in the context of custodial interrogations, . . . and is binding on the States, . . . the Court has continued to measure confessions against the requirements of due process.  <em>See, e.g., Mincey v.
