UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x936822.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 6, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 2, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">After pleading guilty to drug charges, petitioner Pepper was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to 24 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, a nearly 75 percent downward departure from the low end of the Guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance, followed by five years of supervised release.  In <em>Pepper I, t</em>he Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>.  Pepper, who had begun serving his supervised release, testified at his resentencing hearing that he was no longer a drug addict, having completed a 500-hour drug treatment program while in prison; that he was enrolled in community college and had achieved very good grades; and that he was working part time.  Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s father testified that he and his son were no longer estranged, and Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s probation officer testified that a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low recidivism risk.  The District Court again sentenced Pepper to 24 months, granting a 40 percent downward departure based on Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance and a further downward variance based on, <em>inter alia</em>, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.  In <em>Pepper II, </em>the Eighth Circuit again reversed and remanded for resentencing, concluding that Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation could not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance, and directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge.  After this Court vacated and remanded the <em>Pepper II </em>judgment in light of <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/38/index.html">552 U. S. 38</a>, the Eighth Circuit, in <em>Pepper III,</em> reversed and remanded once more<em>. </em> At the second resentencing hearing, Pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in school, was about to be promoted at his job, and had married and was supporting his new family.  Noting the nearly identical remand language of <em>Pepper II</em> and <em>Pepper III,</em> the court observed that it was not bound to reduce Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s range by 40 percent for substantial assistance.  Instead, it found him entitled to a 20 percent reduction and refused to grant a further downward variance for, <em>inter alia</em>, postsentencing rehabilitation.  It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12 months of supervised release.  In <em>Pepper IV, </em>the Eighth Circuit once again rejected Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation argument.  It also rejected his claim that the law of the case from <em>Pepper II</em> and <em>Pepper III</em> required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40 percent.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0When a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guidelines range.

S. 241</a>, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform policy \xe2\x80\x9cunder which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 246, particularly \xe2\x80\x9cthe fullest information possible concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s life and characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 247.  That principle is codified at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73661, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information\xe2\x80\x9d a sentencing court may consider \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning the [defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] background, character, and conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d and at \xc2\xa73553(a), which specifies that sentencing courts must consider, among other things, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chistory and characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(1).  The Guidelines, which <em>Booker</em> made \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively advisory,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U. S., at 245, \xe2\x80\x9cshould be the starting point and the initial benchmark,\xe2\x80\x9d but district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, subject to appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/38/index.html">552 U. S. 38</a>, 49\xe2\x80\x9351.  This sentencing framework applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal.

The plain language of \xc2\xa73661 makes clear that there is \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o limitation \xe2\x80\xa6 on \xe2\x80\xa6 background, character, and conduct\xe2\x80\x9d information, and it makes no distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing.  In addition, postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be highly relevant to several \xc2\xa73553(a) factors that district courts are required to consider at sentencing.  The extensive evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence here.  Most fundamentally, that evidence provides the most up-to-date picture of his \xe2\x80\x9chistory and characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(1).  At the time of his initial sentencing, he was an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family and sold drugs.  By his second resentencing, he had been drug-free for nearly five years, was attending college, was a top employee slated for promotion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and was married and supporting a family.  His postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must consider.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C).  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The contrary arguments advanced by <em>amicus </em>appointed to defend the judgment are unpersuasive.

Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the provision.  While applying \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a partial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively mandatory in some cases and advisory in others.  The fact that \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.  And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating \xc2\xa73742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0This Court finds unpersuasive <em>amicus\xe2\x80\x99</em> arguments focusing on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing objectives under \xc2\xa73553(a).  Contrary to <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 contention, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.  Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of whether \xc2\xa73553(a) permits consideration of such evidence.  Nor is the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the sentencing factor in \xc2\xa73553(a)(5)\xe2\x80\x94which directs sentencing courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cany pertinent policy statement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x94particularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant sentencing statutes.  Consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is also not inconsistent with \xc2\xa73553(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x94which requires courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as any disparity arises only from the normal trial and sentencing process.  The differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under \xc2\xa73553(a)(6).  Pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0On remand, the District Court should consider and give appropriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct since his last sentencing.  Pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because the Eighth Circuit in <em>Pepper III</em> set aside Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s entire sentence and remanded for <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the District Court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the same 40 percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.  To avoid undermining a district court\xe2\x80\x99s original sentencing intent, an appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cmay vacate the entire sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan \xe2\x80\xa6 to satisfy [\xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s] sentencing factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Greenlaw </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/237/index.html">554 U.

S. 241</a>, 246\xe2\x80\x93247 (1949).  Congress codified this principle at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73661, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information\xe2\x80\x9d a sentencing court may consider \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning the [defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] background, character, and con-duct,\xe2\x80\x9d and at \xc2\xa73553(a), which sets forth certain factors that sentencing courts must consider, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(1).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded in this case that the District Court, when resentencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set aside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.  That conclusion conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentenc-ing law and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express directives in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73661 and 3553(a).  Although a separate statutory provision, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing\xe2\x80\x94thus effectively precluding the court from considering postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence\xe2\x80\x94that provision did not survive our holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a> (2005), and we expressly invalidate it today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.  Separately, we affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling that the law of the case doctrine did not require the District Court in this case to apply the same percentage departure from the Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prior sentencing.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7846.  After pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing before then-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.  Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121 months.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Government moved for a downward departure pursuant to USSG \xc2\xa75K1.1 based on Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance and recommended a 15 percent downward departure.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The District Court, however, sentenced Pepper to a 24-month prison term, resulting in an approximately 75 percent downward departure from the low end of the Guidelines range, to be followed by five years of supervised release.  The Government appealed Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, and in June 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of our intervening decision in <em>Booker </em>(and for another reason not relevant here).  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper</em>, 412 F.\xc2\xa03d 995, 999 (2005) <em>(Pepper I)</em>.  Pepper completed his 24-month sentence three days after <em>Pepper I</em> was issued and began serving his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2006, the District Court conducted a resentencing hearing and heard from three witnesses.  In his testimony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously been a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour drug treatment program while in prison and he no longer used any drugs.  App. 104\xe2\x80\x93105.  Pepper then explained that since his release from prison, he had enrolled at a local community college as a full-time student and had earned A\xe2\x80\x99s in all of his classes in the prior semester.  <em>Id.</em>, at 106\xe2\x80\x93107.  Pepper also testified that he had obtained employment within a few weeks after being released from custody and was continuing to work part-time while attending school.  <em>Id.</em>, at 106\xe2\x80\x93110.  Pepper confirmed that he was in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised release and described his changed attitude since his arrest.  See <em>id.</em>, at 111 (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]y life was basically headed to either where\xe2\x80\x94I guess where I ended up, in prison, or death.

Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s drug treatment program, according to his father, \xe2\x80\x9ctruly sobered him up\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmade his way of thinking change.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.</em>, at 121.  He explained that Pepper was now \xe2\x80\x9cmuch more mature\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cserious in terms of planning for the future,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 119, and that as a consequence, he had re-established a relationship with his son, <em>id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93119.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s probation officer testified that, in his view, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low risk of recidivism.  <em>Id.</em>, at 126\xe2\x80\x93131.  The probation officer also prepared a sentencing memorandum that further set forth the reasons supporting his recommendation for a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court adopted as its findings of fact the testimony of the three witnesses and the probation officer\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing memorandum.  The court granted a 40 percent downward departure based on Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance, reducing the bottom of the Guidelines range from 97 to 58 months.  The court then granted a further 59 percent downward variance based on, <em>inter alia</em>, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.  <em>Id.</em>, at 143\xe2\x80\x93148.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of imprisonment, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cit would [not] advance any purpose of federal sentencing policy or any other policy behind the federal sentencing guidelines to send this defendant back to prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 149\xe2\x80\x93150.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government again appealed Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, and the Court of Appeals again reversed and remanded for resentencing.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper</em>, 486 F.\xc2\xa03d 408, 410, 413 (CA8 2007) <em>(Pepper II)</em>.  The court concluded that, while it was \xe2\x80\x9ca close call, [it could not] say the district court abused its discretion\xe2\x80\x9d by granting the 40 percent downward departure for substantial assistance.  <em>Id.</em>, at 411.  The court found the further 59 percent downward variance, however, to be an abuse of discretion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 412\xe2\x80\x93413.  In doing so, the court held that Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpost-sentencing rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 413.  The court stated that evidence of postsentencing reha-bilitation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is not relevant and will not be permitted at resentencing because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original\nsentencing,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and permitting courts to consider post-sentencing rehabilitation at resentencing \xe2\x80\x9cwould create\nunwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant inequities into the sentencing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court of Appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different district judge for resentencing.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 mandate issued, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R.

In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order on the scope of the remand from <em>Pepper II</em>, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court will not consider itself bound to reduce [Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40% pursuant to USSG \xc2\xa75K1.1.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper</em>, No. 03\xe2\x80\x93CR\xe2\x80\x934113\xe2\x80\x93LRR, 2007 WL 2076041, *4 (ND Iowa 2007).  In the meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition, vacated the judgment in <em>Pepper II</em>, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html">552 U.

The court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant a 20 percent downward departure for substantial assistance resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97 months.  The court also granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to account for investigative assistance Pepper provided after he was initially sentenced.

The court further noted that, although issues decided by an appellate court become law of the case on remand to the sentencing court, its earlier decisions merely held that a 40 percent downward departure for substantial assistance was not an abuse of discretion, not that the district court would be bound by the 40 percent departure previously granted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 963\xe2\x80\x93964.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a district court, after a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence has been set aside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward variance when resentencing the defendant, a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals;[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and (2) whether the resentencing court was required, under the law of the case doctrine, to apply the same percentage departure from the Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s prior sentencing.  Because the United States has confessed error in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling on the first question, we appointed an <em>amicus curiae</em> to defend the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  We now vacate the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the first question and affirm its ruling on the second.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Koon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html">518 U.

In doing so, however, Congress recodified \xc2\xa73577 without change at \xc2\xa73661.  The Sentencing Commission, moreover, expressly incorporated \xc2\xa73661 in the Guidelines:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, <em>without limitation</em>, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.  <em>See</em> 18 U.

In our seminal decision in <em>Booker</em>, we held that where facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence increased the applicable Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.  543 U.

Accordingly, although the \xe2\x80\x9cGuidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark,\xe2\x80\x9d district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \xc2\xa73553(a), subject to appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gall</em>, 552 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73661.  The plain language of \xc2\xa73661 makes no distinction between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sentence has been set aside on appeal.  We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe broad language of \xc2\xa73661\xe2\x80\x9d does not provide \xe2\x80\x9cany basis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against considering certain types of evidence at sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Watts</em>, 519 U. S., at 152.  A categorical bar on the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would directly contravene Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expressed intent in \xc2\xa73661.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors that Congress has expressly instructed district courts to consider at sentencing.  For example, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to \xe2\x80\x9cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(1).  Such evidence may also be pertinent to \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for the sentence imposed\xe2\x80\x9d to serve the general purposes of sentencing set forth in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94in particular, to \xe2\x80\x9cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training \xe2\x80\xa6 or other correctional treatment in the most ef-fective manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D); see <em>McMannus</em>, 496 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn assessing \xe2\x80\xa6 deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18 U.

Postsentencing rehabilitation may also critically inform a sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s overarching duty under \xc2\xa73553(a) to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the original sentencing judge recognized, the extensive evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence in this case.  Most fundamentally, evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct since his release from custody in June 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chistory and characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(1); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryson</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] court\xe2\x80\x99s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he stands before the court on the day of sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the time of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25-year-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from his family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a methamphetamine conspiracy.  By the time of his second resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for nearly five years, had attended college and achieved high grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and was married and supporting his wife\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.  There is no question that this evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct since his initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the \xe2\x80\x9chistory and characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d of a defendant that Congress intended sentencing courts to consider.  \xc2\xa73553(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a central factor that district courts must assess when imposing sentence.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C); <em>Gall</em>, 552 U. S., at 59 (\xe2\x80\x9cGall\xe2\x80\x99s self-motivated rehabilitation \xe2\x80\xa6 lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts\xe2\x80\x9d (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C))).  As recognized by Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s probation officer, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s steady employment, as well as his successful completion of a 500-hour drug treatment program and his drug-free condition, also\nsuggest a diminished need for \xe2\x80\x9ceducational or vocation-\nal training \xe2\x80\xa6 or other correctional treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(D).  Finally, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s exemplary postsentencing conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of \xe2\x80\x9chis present purposes and tendencies and significantly to suggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline that ought to be imposed upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ashe</em>, 302 U. S., at 55.  Accordingly, evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation bears directly on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s overarching duty to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to serve the purposes of sentencing.  \xc2\xa73553(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling prohibiting the District Court from considering any evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and contravenes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 directives in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73661 and 3553(a).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em> nevertheless advances two principal arguments in defense of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling: (1) 18 U.

We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 main argument relies on 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(g)(2), a provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below.  That provision states that when a sentence is set aside on appeal, the district court to which the case is remanded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cshall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn operation, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a district court on remand by precluding the court from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a \xe2\x80\x9cground of departure\xe2\x80\x9d that was expressly relied upon in the prior sentencing and upheld on appeal.  <em>Amicus</em> thus correctly contends that, on its face, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) effectively forecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a practical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the prior sentencing.  As the Government concedes, however, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) is invalid after <em>Booker</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have explained, <em>Booker</em> held that where judicial factfinding increases a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances would violate the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.

We recognized in <em>Booker</em> that, although the SRA permitted departures from the applicable Guidelines range in limited circumstances,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cdepartures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 234.  Because in those instances, \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge is bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range,\xe2\x80\x9d we concluded that the availability of departures in certain circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not avoid the constitutional issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the Guidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provisions of the SRA: 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and \xc2\xa73742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of appellate review, including <em>de novo</em> review of Guidelines departures.  543 U. S., at 259.  We invalidated these provisions even though we recognized that mandatory application of the Guidelines would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Indeed, although the Government suggested in <em>Booker </em>that we render the Guidelines advisory only in cases in which the Constitution prohibits judicial factfinding, we rejected that two-track proposal, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a non-mandatory system in others, given the administrative complexities that such a system would create.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 266; see <em>Dillon</em>, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe incomplete remedy we rejected in <em>Booker</em> would have required courts to treat the Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and considerable administrative challenges\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>We did not expressly mention \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) in <em>Booker</em>,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] but the rationale we set forth in that opinion for invalidating \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) applies equally to \xc2\xa73742(g)(2).  As with those provisions, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) requires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases.  Specifically, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) precludes a district court on remand from imposing a sentence \xe2\x80\x9coutside the applicable guidelines range\xe2\x80\x9d except upon a \xe2\x80\x9cground of departure\xe2\x80\x9d that was expressly relied upon by the court at the prior sentencing and upheld by the court of appeals.  In circumstances in which the district court did not rely upon such a departure ground at the prior sentencing, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) would require the court on remand to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, thus rendering the Guidelines effectively mandatory.  Because in a large set of cases, judicial factfinding will increase the applicable Guidelines range beyond that supported solely by the facts established by the jury verdict (or guilty plea), requiring a sentencing judge on remand to apply the Guidelines range, as \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) does, will often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the reasons we explained in <em>Booker</em>.  Accordingly, as with the provisions in <em>Booker</em>, the proper remedy here is to invalidate \xc2\xa73742(g)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sentencing proceeding at issue in <em>Booker </em>itself illustrates why \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) cannot withstand Sixth Amendment scrutiny.  The district court in <em>Booker </em>increased the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s then-mandatory Guidelines range based on a drug-quantity finding that it, rather than\nthe jury, made.  543 U. S., at 227.  After we held that the Guidelines must be treated as advisory, we remanded the case for resentencing.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Had \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) remained valid after <em>Booker</em>, the district court on remand would have been required to sentence within the Guidelines range because it did not depart from the Guidelines at the original sentencing.  Accordingly, the resentencing judge in <em>Booker </em>would have been required under \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on judge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise result that <em>Booker</em> forbids.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same result would occur in any sentencing in which a district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a misunderstanding of its authority to depart under or vary from the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for United States 16.  For example, if \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no remedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed the Guidelines were presumptively reasonable, see <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) <em>(per curiam)</em> (slip op., at 2), or if it mistakenly thought that a non-Guidelines sentence required extraordinary circumstances, see <em>Gall</em>, 552 U. S., at 47, or if it incorrectly concluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine, see <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U. S., at 101.  In such cases, the district court at the initial sentencing proceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence within the Guidelines range, and thus \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) would require the imposition of a Guidelines sentence on remand.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3\xe2\x80\x935 (describing further categories of cases where \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>Booker </em>remedy would be entirely unavailable if \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) were valid\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, applying \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation.  For example, where the applicable Guidelines range rests solely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, application of \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) at resentencing would not render the sentence constitutionally infirm.  But, as explained above, that possibility was equally true with respect to the sentencing provisions we invalidated in <em>Booker</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16.  As with those provisions, \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot assume that Congress, if faced with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity in key applications, would have preferred to apply the statute in as many other instances as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 248.  Just as we rejected a two-track system in <em>Booker</em> that would have made the Guidelines mandatory in some cases and advisory in others, we reject a partial invalidation of \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) that would leave us with the same result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in cases where the prior sentence expressly relied upon a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.  As explained above, we observed in <em>Booker</em> that the availability of departures from the applicable Guidelines ranges in specified circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not avoid the constitutional issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 234.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cdepartures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, we held that remedying the Sixth Amendment problem required invalidation of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1).  That same remedial approach requires us to invalidate \xc2\xa73742(g)(2).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Amicus</em> contends that any constitutional infirmity in \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating \xc2\xa73742(j)(1)(B) rather than \xc2\xa73742(g)(2).

Because \xc2\xa73742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a cross-reference to \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in <em>Booker</em>, <em>amicus </em>suggests that invalidating \xc2\xa73742(j)(1)(B) would cure any constitutional defect in \xc2\xa73742(g)(2)(B).  As the Government explains, however, even if \xc2\xa73742(j)(1)(B) were invalidated and a district court could depart on any ground at an initial sentencing, the district court would not be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing so long as \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) remains in force.  Because <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 proposed solution would still result in the Guidelines being effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire set of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitutional defect of \xc2\xa73742(g)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 next cluster of arguments focuses on Con-\ngress\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing objectives under \xc2\xa73553(a).  Preliminarily, <em>amicus </em>contends that even if \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) is constitutionally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy determination that only information available at the time of original sentencing should be considered, and that this policy determination should inform our analysis of whether \xc2\xa73553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.  This argument, however, is based on a faulty premise.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 contention, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing.  To be sure, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on postsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from resentencing outside the Guidelines range on a \xe2\x80\x9cground of departure\xe2\x80\x9d on which it did not previously rely.  But on its face, nothing in \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from considering postsentencing developments\xe2\x80\x94including postsentencing rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94in selecting a sentence <em>within</em> the applicable Guidelines range.  Section 3742(g)(2) also does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons other than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded (<em>e.g.</em>, when a sentence is set aside on collateral review under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255).  In such circumstances, \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at all, much less with respect to consideration of postsentencing developments.  Accordingly, because we see no general congressional policy reflected in \xc2\xa73742(g)(2) to preclude resentencing courts from considering postsentencing information,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] that provision has no bearing on our analysis of whether \xc2\xa73553(a) permits consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the sentencing factors that Congress has specifically instructed district courts to consider.  See <em>supra</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315 (discussing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D)).  <em>Amicus</em>, however, argues that consideration of postsentencing reha-bilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors: \xc2\xa73553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cany pertinent policy statement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Sentencing Commission, and \xc2\xa73553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to \xc2\xa73553(a)(5), <em>amicus</em> points to the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement in USSG \xc2\xa75K2.19, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense[,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to <em>amicus</em>, that policy statement is \xe2\x80\x9cclear and unequivocal,\xe2\x80\x9d and as an exercise of the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccore function,\xe2\x80\x9d should be given effect.  Brief for <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in Support of Judgment Below 31\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, we have recognized that the Commission post-<em>Booker </em>continues to \xe2\x80\x9cfil[l] an important institutional role\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t has the capacity courts lack to base its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U. S., at 109 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, we have instructed that district courts must still give \xe2\x80\x9crespectful consideration\xe2\x80\x9d to the now-advisory Guidelines (and their accompanying policy statements).  <em>Id</em>., at 101.  As <em>amicus</em> acknowledges, however, our post-<em>Booker</em> decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views.  See <em>id</em>., at 109\xe2\x80\x93110.  That is particularly true where, as here, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views rest on wholly unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentencing statutes Congress enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The commentary to USSG \xc2\xa75K2.19 expresses the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view that departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation would \xe2\x80\x9c(1) be inconsistent with the policies established by Congress under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73624(b) [governing good time credit] and other statutory provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentenced <em>de novo</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  With regard to the first proffered rationale, a sentencing reduction based on postsentencing rehabilitation can hardly be said to be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the policies\xe2\x80\x9d underlying an award of good time credit under \xc2\xa73624(b) because the two serve distinctly different penological interests.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Indeed, the difference between the two is reflected most obviously in the fact that the BOP has no authority to award good time credit where, as in this case, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s good behavior occurs after a sentence has already been served.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered rationale fares no better.  To be sure, allowing district courts to consider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may result in disparate treatment between those defendants who are sentenced properly and those who must be resentenced.  But that disparity arises not because of arbitrary or random sentencing practices, but because of the ordinary operation of appellate sentencing review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a closely related vein, <em>amicus</em> argues that consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with \xc2\xa73553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.  The Court of Appeals also rested its holding on this ground, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98allowing [postsentencing rehabilitation] evidence to influence [defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] sentence would be grossly unfair to the vast majority of defendants who receive no sentencing-court review of any positive post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 965 (quoting <em>McMannus</em>, 496 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 852, n.\xc2\xa04).  But <em>amicus</em> points to no evidence, nor are we aware of any, suggesting that Congress enacted \xc2\xa73553(a)(6) out of a concern with disparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing process.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under \xc2\xa73553(a)(6).  Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaBonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/751/index.html">520 U. S. 751</a>, 761\xe2\x80\x93762 (1997) (disparity arising from exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rhodes</em>, 145 F.\xc2\xa03d 1375, 1381 (CADC 1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cDistinguishing between prisoners whose convictions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly seems \xe2\x80\x98unwarranted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Government explains, moreover, the logic of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach below\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cpost-sentence rehabilitation is not relevant .\xc2\xa0. . because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d 570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 965 (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94would require sentencing courts categorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation, but <em>any</em> postsentencing information, including, for example, evidence that a defendant had committed postsentencing offenses.  Our precedents, however, provide no basis to support such a categorical bar.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wasman</em>, 468 U. S., at 572 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/711/index.html">395 U. S. 711</a>, 723 (1969).  Indeed, even the Court of Appeals below does not accept the logical consequence of its approach as it permits district courts to consider postsentencing conduct that would support a higher sentence.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stapleton</em>, 316 F.\xc2\xa03d 754, 757 (CA8 2003).  Nothing in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a) and 3661, however, remotely suggests that Congress intended district courts to consider only postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant while turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation.  Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones</em>, 460 F.\xc2\xa03d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, the discretion that <em>Booker</em> accords sentencing judges to impose non-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only goes up\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(5) and (a)(6) describe only two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must consider in imposing sentence.  At root, <em>amicus</em> effectively invites us to elevate two \xc2\xa73553(a) factors above all others.  We reject that invitation.  See <em>Gall</em>, 552 U. S., at 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (instructing sentencing courts to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider <em>all</em> of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in categorically precluding the District Court from considering evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside on appeal.  District courts post-<em>Booker</em> may consider evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s motion for release pending disposition of this appeal, see n.\xc2\xa05, <em>supra</em>, the District Court stated that it would not have exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a downward variance based on postsentencing rehabilitation.  That statement, however, was made in light of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 erroneous views regarding postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.  Because we expressly reject those views today, it is unclear from the record whether the District Court would have imposed the same sentence had it properly considered the extensive evidence of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation.  On remand, the District Court should consider and give appropriate weight to that evidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s conduct since his last sentencing in January 2009.  Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in respect to Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second question presented in this case merits only a brief discussion.  As noted above, the original sentencing judge in this case granted Pepper a 40 percent downward departure pursuant to USSG \xc2\xa75K1.1 based on Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s substantial assistance and sentenced him to 24 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  When the Court of Appeals vacated that sentence in <em>Pepper II</em>, and again in <em>Pepper III</em>, the case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Reade.  In resentencing Pepper, Chief Judge Reade ruled that she was not bound by the prior sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant a 40 percent downward departure and instead granted only a 20 percent downward departure, which the Court of Appeals upheld in <em>Pepper IV</em>.  Pepper argues that the law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to apply the same 40 percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Preliminarily, we note that the mandates in <em>Pepper II </em>and <em>Pepper III</em> were \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral remand[s] for resentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cdid not place any limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in resentencing Pepper.\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 963.  In his merits briefs to this Court, Pepper does not challenge the scope or validity of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 mandate ordering <em>de novo</em> resentencing, and thus has abandoned any argument that the mandate itself restricted the District Court from imposing a different substantial assistance departure.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The only question before us is whether the law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to adhere to the original sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision granting a 40 percent downward departure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have described the \xe2\x80\x9claw of the case [a]s an amorphous concept,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s most commonly defined, the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/605/index.html">460 U.

According to Pepper, because Chief Judge Reade identified no such justification, the law of the case doctrine required her to adhere to the 40 percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Government explains, however, the Court of Appeals in <em>Pepper III</em> set aside Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s entire sentence and remanded for a <em>de novo</em> resentencing.  See 518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 949, 953.  Thus, even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the original sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose a 40 percent departure was at one point law of the case, <em>Pepper III</em> effectively wiped the slate clean.  To be sure, <em>Pepper III</em> vacated Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated to the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does not affect our conclusion.  \xe2\x80\x9cA criminal sentence is a package of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stinson</em>, 97 F.\xc2\xa03d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) <em>(per curiam)</em>.

And, like the majority, I believe that the law does not require a sentencing court to follow a Guideline policy statement that forbids taking account of postsentencing rehabilitation. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa75K2.19 (Nov. 2010) (USSG).  I would emphasize, however, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing court free to disregard the Guidelines at will.  To the contrary, the law permits the court to disregard the Guidelines only where it is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d for a court to do so.  <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 261\xe2\x80\x93262; <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html">552 U.

Normally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to consider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sentence in any case \xe2\x80\x9cwhere conduct significantly differs from the norm\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xe2\x80\x9ca particular guideline linguistically applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, \xc2\xa74(b) (discussing the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 general approach to departures).  The policy statement at issue is one of a handful of Guideline rules that nonetheless forbid departure.  It says that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, \xe2\x80\xa6 are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG \xc2\xa75K2.19.  The policy statement thereby adds \xe2\x80\x9cPost-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to such factors as race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guidelines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking into account.

I cannot find the answer to this question in the language of the sentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the pre-Guidelines case of <em>Williams</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/index.html">337 U.

Thus, reference to the statute begs the question.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can I find much help in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a sentencing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tradition\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that considers \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98every convicted person as an individual.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (quoting <em>Koon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html">518 U. S. 81</a>, 113 (1996)).  That is because individualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradition.  A just legal system seeks not only to treat different cases differently but also to treat like cases alike.  Fairness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to recognize relevant sentencing differences.  Indeed, when Congress enacted the sentencing statutes before us, it focused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing failed to treat similar offenders similarly.  And Congress wrote statutes designed primarily (though not exclusively) to bring about greater uniformity in sentencing.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 253\xe2\x80\x93254.  The statutes do so in large part through the creation of a system of Guidelines written by a Sentencing Commission, which Congress intended the courts to follow.  See <em>Mistretta</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a> (1989) (Sentencing Commission constitutional); <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/338/index.html">551 U. S. 338</a>, 348\xe2\x80\x93349 (2007); 18 U.

That is because Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\xe2\x80\x94the law before us\xe2\x80\x94disavowed the individualized approach to sentencing that that case followed.  <em>Williams</em> emphasized the importance of a sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s legal power to tailor punishment ability to fit the circumstances of each individual offender.  337 U.

S., at 490 (Sixth Amendment requires jury findings in respect to factual matters that require judge to increase sentence); <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (2004) (same in respect to a State\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory guidelines).  In light of this Sixth Amendment prohibition, the Court, believing that Congress would not have intended to introduce new juries into each sentencing proceeding, excised the few particular provisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that application of the Guidelines was mandatory.  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 259.  The Court believed that the relevant statutes remained workable without those few provisions, that their excision could further Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic sentencing intentions, and that excision was more likely to do so than invalidation of the entire statutory scheme.  With an occasional exception (such as the statutory provision we strike down today), there is no reason to think that the sentencing statutes as limited in <em>Booker </em>run afoul of\nthe Sixth Amendment.  <em>Ibid.</em></f></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Booker</em> made clear that the remaining statutory provisions, while leading us to call the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory\xe2\x80\x9d (rather than \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d), do not give a sentencing judge <em>carte blanche </em>to apply, or not to apply, the Guidelines as that judge chooses.  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 264.  Moreover, <em>Booker </em>held that appellate court review of sentencing is valid.  <em>Booker</em> explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory language, the structure of the [Sentencing Reform Act], and the sound administration of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d taken together, require appellate courts to apply \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of review.  <em>Id.,</em> at 260\xe2\x80\x93261, 262 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reasonableness standards, we added, are \xe2\x80\x9cnot foreign to sentencing law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 262.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cAct has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances\xe2\x80\x94both on review of departures \xe2\x80\xa6 and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid.</em>  See also <em>id.,</em> at 261 (appellate courts will apply \xe2\x80\x9ca practical standard of review already familiar to appellate courts: review for \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable[ness]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 264 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9creview sentencing decisions for unreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have also indicated that, in applying reasonableness standards, the appellate courts should take account of sentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and Guidelines, as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts.  Thus, in <em>Kimbrough</em>, we observed that in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete institutional strengths\xe2\x80\x9d of the Sentencing Commission and sentencing judges, \xe2\x80\x9ca district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \xe2\x80\x98outside the \xe2\x80\x9cheartland\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at 109 (quoting <em>Rita</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 351).  We noted, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Guidelines range \xe2\x80\x98fails properly to reflect \xc2\xa73553(a) considerations\xe2\x80\x99 even in a mine-run case.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at 109.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unlike the majority, I would decide the question <em>Kimbrough </em>left open.  And I would follow its suggested framework for evaluating \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  As <em>Kim-brough </em>suggests, doing so takes proper account of the comparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate courts, and the Sentencing Commission.  The trial court typically better understands the individual circumstances of particular cases before it, while the Commission has comparatively greater ability to gather information, to consider a broader national picture, to compare sentences attaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write more coherent overall standards that reflect nationally uniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying <em>Kimbrough\xe2\x80\x99</em>s suggested framework, I would reason very much as does the majority.  The first question is whether a sentencing judge might <em>sometimes </em>take account of a (resentenced) offender\xe2\x80\x99s postsentencing rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94despite a Guideline policy statement that says <em>never</em>.  I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to disregard the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 absolute prohibition, despite the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s comparatively greater policy-formation abilities.  That is because the Guideline policy statement itself runs counter to ordinary Guideline sentencing policy, which rarely forbids departures and then for very strong policy reasons.  <em>Supra, </em>at 2.  See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, \xc2\xa74(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission offers no convincing justification for creating this exception with respect to postsentencing rehabilitation.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s commentary says that for a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this reason (reflecting good behavior while the case is on appeal) would conflict with the use of other mechanisms, such as \xe2\x80\x9cgood-time\xe2\x80\x9d credits, for that purpose.  But how is that so?  A defendant, after sentencing but while his case is on appeal, may or may not be entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cgood time.\xe2\x80\x9d  That may depend upon whether he remains on bail or upon particular \xe2\x80\x9cgood-time\xe2\x80\x9d rules.  Regardless, the resentencing judge can take account of any such matter.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s commentary also suggests it would be <em>inequitable</em> to allow an offender who is being resentenced to receive any kind of credit for his good behavior, say while his case was on appeal.  But why is that so?  After all, the Guidelines permit a judge to take account of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s good behavior after arrest but before initial sentencing.  That time period could last longer than the time taken up on appeal.  Why should pretrial behavior count but appeal time behavior not count?  Like the majority, I find this justification for the policy statement unconvincing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second question is whether, given the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s power to disregard the policy statement forbidding departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation, the facts and circumstances here could warrant a departure (or variance) for that reason.  And the answer, in my view, is yes.  This case presents unusual rehabilitative circumstances.  As the majority observes: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the time of his second resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for nearly five years, had attended college and achieved high grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion, had reestablished a relationship with his father, and was married and supporting his wife\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  These are case-specific facts and circumstances, and they are of the kind that should lead appellate courts to show their \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest respect\xe2\x80\x9d for a sentencing decision, including a departure or variance, that rests upon them.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted them, require courts of appeals to review sentences for reasonableness, including sentences that depart or vary from a specific Guideline.  The appellate courts should review those decisions more closely when they rest upon disagreement with Guidelines policy.  <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U. S., at 109.  They should review those decisions with greater deference when they rest upon case-specific circumstances that place the case outside a specific Guideline\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cheartland.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Rita</em>, 551 U. S.<em>,</em> at 351; <em>Koon</em>, 518 U. S., at 98\xe2\x80\x9399.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we can remain faithful to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic intent in writing them\xe2\x80\x94despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions that conflict with the Sixth Amendment.  The statutes create a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop sentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines.  The Guidelines are to further the statutes\xe2\x80\x99 basic objective, namely greater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account of special individual circumstances, primarily by permitting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases.  By collecting trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 reasons for departure (or variance), by examining appellate court reactions, by developing statistical and other empirical information, by considering the views of expert penologists and others, the Commission can revise the Guidelines accordingly.  See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, \xc2\xa73.  Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Commission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an iterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a more uniform and a more equitable sentencing system. See <em>id.,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x9315.  I would interpret the statutes before us accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963451">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nPEPPER V.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 258\xe2\x80\x93265 (2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme advisory, a remedy that was \xe2\x80\x9cfar broader than necessary to correct constitutional error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/85/index.html">552 U. S. 85</a>, 114 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Because there is \xe2\x80\x9cno principled way to apply the <em>Booker </em>remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d I have explained that it is \xe2\x80\x9cbest to apply the statute as written, including 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d unless doing so would actually violate the Sixth Amendment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 116; see <em>Booker</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 313\xe2\x80\x93326 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part); <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html">552 U.

S. 708</a>, 717 (2008) (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would apply the Guidelines as written in this case because doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment.  The constitutional problem arises only when a judge makes \xe2\x80\x9ca finding that raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 313 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Pepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement with between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine mixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A)(viii).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pepper</em>, 412 F.\xc2\xa03d 995, 996 (CA8 2005).  Because Pepper has admitted facts that would support a much longer sentence than the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amendment problem in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was proper.  The District Court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG \xc2\xa75K1.1 departure and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion under Federal Rule \nof Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month sentence.  Guideline \xc2\xa75K2.19 expressly prohibits downward departures based on \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor is there any provision in the Guidelines for the \xe2\x80\x9cvariance\xe2\x80\x9d Pepper seeks, as such variances are creations of the <em>Booker </em>remedy.  I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision to uphold Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this outcome would not represent my own policy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress and the Federal Sentencing Commission.  Like the majority, I believe that postsentencing rehabilitation can be highly relevant to meaningful resentencing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  In light of Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s success in escaping drug addiction and becoming a productive member of society, I do not see what purpose further incarceration would serve.  But Congress made the Guidelines mandatory, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1), and authorized USSG \xc2\xa75K2.19.  I am constrained to apply those provisions unless the Constitution prohibits me from doing so, and it does not here.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that the law of the case doctrine did not control Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s resentencing.

I agree with the Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on the basis of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(g), as <em>amicus </em>suggests.  This provision was designed to function as part of the mandatory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 258\xe2\x80\x93265 (2005).

That decision, which entirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was consistent with the policy statement in \xc2\xa75K2.19 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he<em> Booker </em>remedial decision\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0does not permit a court of appeals\nto treat the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 policy decisions as binding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/85/index.html">552 U. S. 85</a>, 116 (2007) (Alito, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Booker</em>, however, district judges are still required<em> </em>in almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  See 552 U. S., at 116; <em>Gall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/38/index.html">552 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(4), (5), and requiring judges to give significant weight to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy decisions does not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the mandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, <em>i.e.</em>, the right to have a jury make certain factual findings that are relevant to sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I continue to believe that sentencing judges should be required to give significant weight to all  Guidelines provisions and policy statements, see <em>Kimbrough</em>, 552 U. S.<em>, </em>at 116 (opinion of Alito, J.), the Court in <em>Kimbrough</em> held that sentencing judges may not be required to give weight to some unusual policy decisions, see <em>id., </em>at 109\xe2\x80\x93110 (majority opinion).  And Justice Breyer now makes a reasonable case that the particular policy statement involved in this case is distinguishable from almost all of the other rules that the Commission has adopted.  See <em>ante, </em>p. ___ (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). <em> </em>His position seems to me more consistent with <em>Kimbrough</em> than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  It would at least prevent us from sliding all the way down the slippery slope that leads back to the regime of entirely discretionary federal sentencing that preceded the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Anyone familiar with the history of criminal sentencing in this country cannot fail to see the irony in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s praise for the sentencing scheme exemplified by <em>Williams</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/index.html">337 U.
