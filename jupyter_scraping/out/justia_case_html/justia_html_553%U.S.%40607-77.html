As of its November 1, 1964 coverage date, state law provided that midterm vacancies on county commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment.  In 1985, the state legislature passed, and the DOJ precleared, a \xe2\x80\x9clocal law\xe2\x80\x9d providing that Mobile County Commission midterm vacancies would be filled by special election rather than gubernatorial appointment.  In 1987, the Governor called a special election for the first midterm opening on the Commission postpassage of the 1985 Act.  A Mobile County voter, Willie Stokes, filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin the election, but the state trial court denied his request.  Although Stokes immediately appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, the special election went forward and the winner took office.  Subsequently, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, finding that the 1985 Act violated the State Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the next midterm Commission vacancy occurred in 2005, the method of filling the opening again became the subject of litigation.  In 2004, the state legislature had passed, and the DOJ had precleared, a law providing for gubernatorial appointment as the means to fill county commission vacancies unless a local law authorized a special election. When the vacancy arose, appellee voters and state legislators (hereinafter Kennedy) filed suit against the Governor in state court, asserting that the 2004 Act had revived the 1985 Act and cured its infirmity under the Alabama Constitution.  Adopting Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s view, the trial court ordered the Governor to call a special election.  Before the election took place, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order, holding that the 2004 Act did not resurrect the 1985 Act.  The Governor therefore filled the vacancy by appointment, naming Commissioner Chastang to the open seat.  Kennedy then commenced this suit in Federal District Court.  Invoking \xc2\xa75 of the VRA, she sought declaratory relief and an injunction barring the Governor from filling the Commission vacancy by appointment unless and until Alabama gained preclearance of the <em>Stokes</em> and <em>Kennedy </em>decisions.  A three-judge District Court granted the requested declaration in August 2006.  It determined that the \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d against which any change should be measured was the 1985 Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision requiring special elections, a measure both precleared and put into \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect\xe2\x80\x9d with the special election in 1987.  It followed, the District Court reasoned, that the gubernatorial appointment called for by <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy</em> ranked as a change from the baseline practice; consequently, those decisions should have been precleared.  Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the State 90 days to obtain preclearance.  When the DOJ denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s request for preclearance, Kennedy returned to the District Court and filed a motion for further relief.  On May 1, 2007, the District Court vacated the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Chastang to the Commission, finding it unlawful under \xc2\xa75 of the VRA.  The Governor filed a notice of appeal in the District Court on May 18.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because the District Court did not render its final judgment until May 1, 2007, the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s May 18 notice of appeal was timely.  Under \xc2\xa75, \xe2\x80\x9cany appeal\xe2\x80\x9d from the decision of a three-judge district court \xe2\x80\x9cshall lie to the Supreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.

Kennedy maintains that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s August 2006 order qualified as a final judgment, while the Governor maintains that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment was the May 1 order vacating Chastang\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.

In <em>Perkins</em> v. <em>Matthews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/379/index.html">400 U. S. 379</a>, the question was what practice had been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d in Canton, Mississippi, on that State\xe2\x80\x99s 1964 coverage date.  A 1962 state law required at-large elections for city aldermen, but Canton had elected aldermen by wards in 1961 and again in 1965.  This Court held that the city\xe2\x80\x99s 1969 attempt to move to at-large elections was a change requiring preclearance because election by ward was \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedure <em>in fact</em> \xe2\x80\x98in force or effect\xe2\x80\x99 in Canton\xe2\x80\x9d on the coverage date.  <em>Id.</em>, at 395.  Similarly, in <em>City of Lockhart</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/125/index.html">460 U. S. 125</a>, the question was what practice had been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d in Lockhart, Texas, on the relevant coverage date.  The city had used a \xe2\x80\x9cnumbered-post\xe2\x80\x9d system to elect its city council for more than 50 years.  Though the numbered-post system\xe2\x80\x99s validity under state law was \xe2\x80\x9cnot entirely clear,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 132, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system and the system actually in effect on\xe2\x80\x9d the coverage date, \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of what state law might have required,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Finally, in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Fordice</em>, the question was whether a provisional voter registration plan precleared and implemented by Mississippi election officials, who believed that the state legislature was about to amend the relevant law, had been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 520 U. S., at 279.  As it turned out, the state legislature failed to pass the amendment, and voters who had registered under the provisional plan were required to reregister.  This Court held that the provisional plan was a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary misapplication of state law\xe2\x80\x9d that, for \xc2\xa75 purposes, was \xe2\x80\x9cnever \xe2\x80\x98in force or effect.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  <em>Young </em>thus qualified the general rule of <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Lockhart:\xc2\xa0</em>A practice best characterized as nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary misapplication of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d is <em>not</em> in \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect,\xe2\x80\x9d even if actually implemented by state election officials, 520 U. S., at 282.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0If the only relevant factors were the length of time a practice was in use and the degree to which it was implemented, this would be a close case under <em>Perkins, Lockhart, </em>and <em>Young.</em>  But an extraordinary circumstance not present in any past case is operative here, impelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d: The Act was challenged in state court at first opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge, and the Act was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.  These characteristics plainly distinguish this case from <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Lockhart, </em>where the state judiciary had no involvement.  The prompt legal challenge and the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision also provide strong cause to conclude that, in the \xc2\xa75 context, the 1985 Act was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  A State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court is unquestionably \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullaney</em> v. <em>Wilbur</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/index.html">421 U. S. 684</a>, 691.  And because the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to say what Alabama law is merits respect in federal forums, a law challenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court is properly regarded as null and void <em>ab initio</em>, incapable of effecting any change in Alabama law or establishing a voting practice under \xc2\xa75.  There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply because Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court did not render its decision until after an election was held.  To the contrary, practical considerations sometimes require courts to allow elections to proceed despite pending legal challenges.  Cf. <em>Purcell</em> v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/1/index.html">549 U. S. 1</a>, 5\xe2\x80\x936 <em>(per curiam).  </em>Ruling otherwise would have the anomalous effect of binding Alabama to an unconstitutional practice because of the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.  The trial court misconstrued the State\xe2\x80\x99s law and, due to that court\xe2\x80\x99s error, an election took place.  That sequence of events, the District Court held, made the 1985 Act part of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 baseline.  In essence, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision gave controlling effect to the erroneous trial court ruling and rendered the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s corrections inoperative.  That sort of interference with a state supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to determine the content of state law is more than a hypothetical concern.  The realities of election litigation are such that lower state courts often allow elections to proceed based on erroneous interpretations of state law later corrected on appeal.  The Court declines to adopt a rigid interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d that would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to correct similar errors in the future.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Although this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and the facts of this case should make the narrow scope of the holding apparent, some cautionary observations are in order.  First, the presence of a judgment by Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court invalidating the 1985 Act under the State Constitution is critical here.  The outcome might be different were a potentially unlawful practice simply abandoned by state officials after initial use in an election.  Cf. <em>Perkins, </em>400 U. S., at 395.  Second, the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was invoked and struck down shortly thereafter.  The same result would not necessarily follow if a practice were invalidated only after enforcement without challenge in several previous elections.  Cf. <em>Young</em>, 520 U. S., at 283.  Finally, the consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Stokes</em> decision was to reinstate a practice\xe2\x80\x94gubernatorial appointment\xe2\x80\x94identical to the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 baseline.  Preclearance might well have been required had the court instead ordered the State to adopt a novel practice.

The setting, in a nutshell: A covered State passed a law adopting a new election practice, obtained the preclearance required by \xc2\xa75, and held an election.  Soon thereafter, the law under which the election took place was invalidated by the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court on the ground that it violated a controlling provision of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution.  The question presented: Must the State obtain fresh preclearance in order to reinstate the election practice prevailing before enactment of the law struck down by the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court?  We hold that, for \xc2\xa75 purposes, the invalidated law never gained \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Therefore, the State\xe2\x80\x99s reversion to its prior practice did not rank as a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d requiring preclearance.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.

The first occurred between 1985 and 1988; the second began in 2004 and culminates in the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alabama is a covered jurisdiction with a coverage date of November 1, 1964.  See 30 Fed. Reg. 9897 (1965).  As of that date, Alabama law provided that midterm vacancies on all county commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment.  See Ala. Code \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x936 (1959).  The relevant provision was later recodified without substantive change as Ala. Code \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x936 (1975), which stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn case of a vacancy, it shall be filled by appointment by the governor, and the person so appointed shall hold office for the remainder of the term of the commissioner in whose place he is appointed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn 1985, however, the state legislature passed a \xe2\x80\x9clocal law\xe2\x80\x9d providing that any vacancy on the Mobile County Commission occurring \xe2\x80\x9cwith twelve months or more remaining on the term of the vacant seat\xe2\x80\x9d would be filled by special election rather than gubernatorial appointment.  1985 Ala. Acts no. 85\xe2\x80\x93237 (1985 Act).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The DOJ precleared this new law in June 1985.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first midterm opening on the Commission postpassage of the 1985 Act occurred in 1987, when the seat for District One\xe2\x80\x94a majority African-American district\xe2\x80\x94became vacant.  In accord with the 1985 Act, the Governor called a special election.  A Mobile County voter, Willie Stokes, promptly filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin the election.  The 1985 Act, he alleged, violated Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa7105, of the Alabama Constitution, which provides that no \xe2\x80\x9clocal law \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be enacted in any case which is provided for by a general law.\xe2\x80\x9d  On Stokes\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the 1985 Act conflicted with \xc2\xa7105 because the Act addressed a matter already governed by Ala. Code \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state trial court rejected Stokes\xe2\x80\x99s argument and entered judgment for the state defendants.  Stokes immediately appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court and sought an order staying the election pending that court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The requested stay was denied and the special election went forward in June 1987.  The winner, Samuel Jones, took office as District One\xe2\x80\x99s Commissioner in July 1987.  Approximately 14 months later, however, in September 1988, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Finding that the 1985 Act \xe2\x80\x9cclearly offend[ed] \xc2\xa7105 of the [Alabama] Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d the court declared the Act unconstitutional.  <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Noonan</em>, 534 So. 2d 237, 238\xe2\x80\x93239 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decree cast grave doubt on the legitimacy of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s election and, consequently, on his continued tenure in office.  The Governor, however, defused any potential controversy by immediately invoking his authority under Ala. Code \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x936 and appointing Jones to the Commission.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next midterm vacancy on the Commission did not occur until October 2005, when Jones\xe2\x80\x94who had been reelected every four years since 1988\xe2\x80\x94was elected mayor of the city of Mobile.  Once again, the method of filling the vacancy became the subject of litigation.  In 2004, the state legislature had passed (and the DOJ had precleared) an amendment to Ala. Code \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x936 providing that vacancies on county commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a local law authorizes a special election.\xe2\x80\x9d  2004 Ala. Acts no. 2004\xe2\x80\x93455 (2004 Act).  When the 2005 vacancy arose, three Mobile County voters and Alabama state legislators\xe2\x80\x94appellees Yvonne Kennedy, James Buskey, and William Clark (hereinafter Kennedy)\xe2\x80\x94filed suit against Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Governor, Bob Riley, in state court.  The 2004 Act\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of local laws providing for special elections, they urged, had revived the 1985 Act and cured its infirmity under \xc2\xa7105 of the Alabama Constitution.  Adopting Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s view, the state trial court ordered Governor Riley to call a special election.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court was pending, Mobile County\xe2\x80\x99s election officials obtained preclearance of procedures for a special election, scheduled to take place in January 2006.  In November 2005, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Holding that the 2004 Act \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[d] for prospective application only\xe2\x80\x9d and thus did not resurrect the 1985 Act, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court ruled that \xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Riley [wa]s authorized to fill the vacancy on the Mobile County Commission by appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Kennedy</em>, 928 So.\xc2\xa02d 1013, 1017 (2005).  Governor Riley promptly exercised that authority by appointing Juan Chastang.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The day after the Alabama Supreme Court denied rehearing, Kennedy commenced the instant suit in Federal District Court.  Invoking \xc2\xa75, she sought declaratory relief and an injunction barring Governor Riley from filling the Commission vacancy by appointment unless and until Alabama gained preclearance of the decisions in <em>Stokes</em> and <em>Kennedy</em>.  As required by \xc2\xa75, a three-judge District Court convened to hear the suit.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71973c(a) (Supp. 2007); <em>Allen</em>, 393 U. S., at 563.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2006, the three-judge court, after a hearing, granted the requested declaration.  The court observed first that for purposes of \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance requirement, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hanges are measured by comparing the new challenged practice with the baseline practice, that is, the most recent practice that is both precleared and in force or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1333, 1336 (MD Ala.).  It then determined that the 1985 Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision requiring special elections had been both precleared and put into \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect\xe2\x80\x9d with the special election of Jones in 1987.  It followed, the District Court reasoned, that the gubernatorial appointment called for by <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy</em> ranked as a change from the baseline practice; consequently \xe2\x80\x9cthe two [Alabama Supreme Court] decisions \xe2\x80\xa6 should have been precleared before they were implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1336<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the State 90 days to obtain preclearance of <em>Stokes</em> and <em>Kennedy</em>.  445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp 2d, at 1336.<em> </em>Without conceding that preclearance was required, the State submitted the decisions to the DOJ.  Finding that the State had failed to prove that the reinstatement of gubernatorial appointment would not be retrogressive, the Department denied preclearance.  See App. to Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 2a\xe2\x80\x938a.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe African-American voters of District 1,\xe2\x80\x9d the DOJ explained, \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy the opportunity to elect minority candidates of their choice\xe2\x80\x9d under the 1985 Act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 6a.  A change to gubernatorial appointment would be retrogressive because it \xe2\x80\x9cwould transfer this electoral power to a state official elected by a statewide constituency whose racial make-up and electoral choices regularly differ from those of the voters of District 1.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the State unsuccessfully sought DOJ reconsideration, Kennedy returned to the District Court and filed a motion for further relief.  On May 1, 2007, the District Court ruled that \xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Bob Riley\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Juan Chastang to the Mobile County Commission \xe2\x80\xa6 was unlawful under federal law\xe2\x80\x9d and vacated the appointment.  App. to Juris. Statement 1a\xe2\x80\x932a.  Governor Riley filed a notice of appeal in the District Court on May 18, 2007, and a Jurisdictional Statement in this Court on July 17, 2007.

S. ___.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the meantime, a special election was held in Mobile County in October 2007 to fill the vacancy resulting from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order vacating Chastang\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Chastang ran in the election but was defeated by Merceria Ludgood, who garnered nearly 80% of the vote.

Her term will expire in November 2008.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before reaching the merits of Governor Riley\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, we first take up Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s threshold objection.  The appeal, Kennedy urges, must be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 5 provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany appeal\xe2\x80\x9d from the decision of a three-judge district court \xe2\x80\x9cshall lie to the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c(a).  Such an appeal must be filed within 60 days of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s entry of a final judgment.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72101(b).  Kennedy maintains that Governor Riley\xe2\x80\x99s May 18, 2007 notice of appeal came too late because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s August 2006 order qualified as a final judgment.  If Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s characterization is correct, then Governor Riley\xe2\x80\x99s time to file an appeal expired in October 2006 and his appeal must be dismissed.  But if, as Governor Riley maintains, the District Court did not issue a final judgment until the order vacating Chastang\xe2\x80\x99s appointment on May 1, 2007, then the Governor filed his appeal well within the required time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A final judgment is \xe2\x80\x9cone which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Catlin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/229/index.html">324 U. S. 229</a>, 233 (1945).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s August 2006 order declared that the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy</em> required preclearance, but that order left unresolved Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s demand for injunctive relief.  We have long held that an order resolving liability without addressing a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s requests for relief is not final.  See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Wetzel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/737/index.html">424 U. S. 737</a>, 742\xe2\x80\x93743 (1976).  See also 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73915.2, p. 271 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resisting the conclusion these authorities indicate, Kennedy maintains that the August 2006 order ranked as a final decision for two reasons.  First, she contends, that order conclusively settled the key remedial issue, for it directed Governor Riley to seek preclearance of the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy</em>.  See Brief for Appellees 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  This argument misapprehends the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order: Far from requiring the Governor to seek preclearance, the District Court expressly allowed for the possibility that he would elect not to do so.  See 445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1337 (\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant Riley is to keep the court informed of what action, <em>if any</em>, the State decides to take \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Second, Kennedy notes that the District Court directed entry of its August 2006 order \xe2\x80\x9cas a final judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  See Brief for Appellees 27.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe label used by the District Court,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot control [an] order\xe2\x80\x99s appealability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Finkelstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/617/index.html">496 U.

S., at 741\xe2\x80\x93743.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the District Court did not render its final judgment until May 1, 2007, Governor Riley\xe2\x80\x99s May 18 notice of appeal was timely.  We therefore proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 1985, Alabama filled midterm vacancies on the Mobile County Commission by gubernatorial appointment.  The 1985 Act adopted a different practice\xe2\x80\x94special elections.  That new practice was used in one election only, held in 1987.  The next year, the Alabama Supreme Court determined, in <em>Stokes</em> v. <em>Noonan</em>, that the Act authorizing special elections was invalid under the State\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution.  Properly framed, the issue before us is whether \xc2\xa75 required Alabama to obtain preclearance before reinstating the practice of gubernatorial appointment in the wake of the decision by its highest court invalidating the special-election law.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d from election to appointment is a change \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to voting\xe2\x80\x9d and thus covered by \xc2\xa75.  See <em>Allen</em>, 393 U. S., at 569\xe2\x80\x93570; <em>Presley</em> v. <em>Etowah County Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/491/index.html">502 U.

The question is whether, given the circumstances here presented, any \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa75 occurred in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to determine whether an election practice constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in our \xc2\xa75 precedents, we compare the practice with the covered jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have defined the baseline as the most recent practice that was both precleared and \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, absent any change since the jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s coverage date, the practice that was \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d on that date.  See <em>Young</em>, 520 U. S., at 282\xe2\x80\x93283.  See also <em>Presley</em>, 502 U. S., at 495.  The question is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a State has \xe2\x80\x98enact[ed]\xe2\x80\x99 or is \xe2\x80\x98seek[ing] to administer\xe2\x80\x99 a \xe2\x80\x98practice or procedure\xe2\x80\x99 that is \xe2\x80\x98different\xe2\x80\x99 enough\xe2\x80\x9d from the baseline to qualify as a change.  <em>Young</em>, 520 U.

At all relevant times, therefore, the baseline practice for filling midterm vacancies on the Commission was the pre-1985 practice of gubernatorial appointment.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement of that practice thus did not constitute a change requiring preclearance.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have directly addressed the \xc2\xa75 term of art \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d on three prior occasions.  As will become clear, these precedents do not control this case because they differ in a critical respect.  They do, however, provide the starting point for our inquiry.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Perkins</em> v. <em>Matthews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/379/index.html">400 U. S. 379</a> (1971), the question was what practice had been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d in the city of Canton, Mississippi, on that State\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 coverage date, November 1, 1964.  A 1962 state law required selection of city aldermen by at-large elections rather than by ward.  Canton, however, \xe2\x80\x9cignored the mandate [of the statute] in the conduct of the 1965 municipal elections and, as in 1961, elected aldermen by wards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 394.  In the 1969 election, the city sought to switch to at-large elections.  We held that this move was a change requiring preclearance because election by ward was \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedure <em>in fact</em> \xe2\x80\x98in force or effect\xe2\x80\x99 in Canton on November 1, 1964.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We endeavored to determine in <em>Perkins </em>the voting procedure that would have been followed on the coverage date, November 1, 1964.  Two choices were apparent: the state law on the books since 1962 calling for at-large elections, or the practice Canton actually used, <em>without challenge</em>, in 1965\xe2\x80\x94election by wards.  We picked the 1965 practice as the more likely indicator of the practice Canton would have employed had it held an election on the coverage date, just seven months earlier.  See <em>id.</em>, at 394\xe2\x80\x93395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>City of Lockhart</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/125/index.html"></a><a href="/us/460/125/index.html">460 U. S. 125</a> (1983), the question was what practice had been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d in Lockhart, Texas, on the relevant \xc2\xa75 coverage date, November 1, 1972.  For more than 50 years, without challenge, the city had used a \xe2\x80\x9cnumbered-post\xe2\x80\x9d system to elect its city council.  See <em>id</em>., at 132, n.\xc2\xa06.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  A group of plaintiffs nonetheless contended that the numbered-post system was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d because it lacked state-law authorization.  We noted that the validity of the numbered-post system under state law was \xe2\x80\x9cnot entirely clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 132.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Relying on <em>Perkins</em>, we considered the uncertain state of Texas law \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system and the system actually in effect on November 1, 1972, regardless of what state law might have required.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.

See 520 U. S., at 279.  Roughly one-third of the State\xe2\x80\x99s election officials implemented the plan, registering around 4,000 voters.  See <em>id.</em>, at 278, 283.  As it turned out, however, the state legislature failed to pass the amendment, and the voters who had registered under the provisional plan were required to reregister.  See <em>id.</em>, at 278.  When the case reached us, we rejected the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [p]rovisional [p]lan, because it was precleared by the Attorney General, became part of the baseline against which to judge whether a future change must be precleared.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  Regarding the provisional plan as a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary misapplication of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that, for \xc2\xa75 purposes, the plan was \xe2\x80\x9cnever \xe2\x80\x98in force or effect.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We emphasized that the officials who implemented the provisional plan \xe2\x80\x9cdid not intend to administer an unlawful plan\xe2\x80\x9d and that they abandoned it \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as its unlawfulness became apparent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 283.  We also noted that the provisional plan had been used for only 41 days and that the State \xe2\x80\x9cheld no elections\xe2\x80\x9d during that period.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perkins </em>and <em>Lockhart </em>established that an election practice may be \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa75 purposes despite its illegality under state law if, as a practical matter, it was \xe2\x80\x9cactually in effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lockhart</em>, 460 U. S., at 132.  Our more recent decision in <em>Young</em>, however, qualified that general rule: A practice best characterized as nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary misapplication of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, is <em>not</em> in \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect,\xe2\x80\x9d even if actually implemented by state election officials.  520 U. S., at 282.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the only relevant factors were the length of time a practice was in use and the extent to which it was implemented, this would be a close case falling somewhere between the two poles established by our prior decisions.  On one hand, as in <em>Young</em>, the 1985 Act was a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary misapplication\xe2\x80\x9d of state law: It was on the books for just over three years and applied as a voting practice only once.  In <em>Lockhart</em>, by contrast, the city had used the numbered-post system \xe2\x80\x9cfor over 50 years without challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U. S., at 132, n.\xc2\xa06.  (<em>Perkins</em> is a less clear case: The city failed to alter its practice in response to changed state law for roughly seven years, but only a single election was held during that period.  See 400 U. S., at 394.)  On the other hand, in <em>Young </em>no election occurred during the time the provisional registration plan was in use, while in this case one election <em>was </em>held under the later-invalidated 1985 Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are convinced, however, that an extraordinary circumstance not present in any past case is operative here, impelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d: The Act was challenged in state court at first opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge, and the Act was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These characteristics plainly distinguish the present case from <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Lockhart</em>.  The state judiciary had no involvement in either of those cases, as the practices at issue were administered without legal challenge of any kind.  And in <em>Lockhart</em>,<em> </em>we justified our unwillingness to incorporate a practice\xe2\x80\x99s legality under state law into the \xc2\xa75 \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry in part on this ground: \xe2\x80\x9cWe doubt[ed] that Congress intended\xe2\x80\x9d to require \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General and the District Court for the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x9d to engage in \xe2\x80\x9cspeculation as to state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U. S., at 133, n.\xc2\xa08.  Here, in contrast, the 1985 Act\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity under the Alabama Constitution has been definitively established by the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prompt legal challenge and the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision not only distinguish this case from <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Lockhart; </em>they also provide strong cause to conclude that, in the context of \xc2\xa75, the 1985 Act was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  A State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court is unquestionably \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate exposito[r] of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullaney</em> v. <em>Wilbur</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/index.html">421 U. S. 684</a>, 691 (1975).  And because the prerogative of the Alabama Supreme Court to say what Alabama law is merits respect in federal forums,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] a law challenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court is properly regarded as null and void <em>ab initio</em>, incapable of effecting any change in Alabama law or establishing a voting practice for \xc2\xa75 purposes.  Indeed, Kennedy and the United States appear to concede that the 1985 Act would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d had the Alabama Supreme Court stayed the 1987 election pending its decision in <em>Stokes </em>(or simply issued its decision sooner).  See Brief for Appellees 51; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply because Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, proceeding at a pace hardly uncommon in litigated controversies, did not render its decision until after an election was held.  In this regard, we have recognized that practical considerations sometimes require courts to allow elections to proceed despite pending legal challenges.  Cf. <em>Purcell</em> v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/1/index.html">549 U. S. 1</a>, 5\xe2\x80\x936 (2006) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction suspending the [challenged] rules.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ruling as Kennedy and the United States urge, moreover, would have the anomalous effect of binding Alabama to an unconstitutional practice because of a state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.  If the trial court had gotten the law of Alabama right, all agree, there would have been no special election and no tenable argument that the 1985 Act had ever gained \xe2\x80\x9cforce or effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the trial court misconstrued the State\xe2\x80\x99s law and, due to that court\xe2\x80\x99s error, an election took place.  That sequence of events, the District Court held, made the Act part of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 baseline.  No precedent of this Court calls for such a holding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court took care to note that its decision \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not in any way undermine <em>[Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy]</em> under state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1337.  In some theoretical sense, that may be true.  Practically, however, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision gave controlling effect to the erroneous trial court decision and rendered the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s corrections inoperative.  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, that State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court determined, required that, in the years here involved, vacancies on the Mobile County Commission be filled by appointment rather than special election.  Nothing inherent in the practice of appointment violates the Fifteenth Amendment or the VRA.  The DOJ, however, found that a <em>change</em> from special elections to appointment had occurred in District One, and further found that the change was retrogressive, hence barred by \xc2\xa75.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s final decision, tied to the DOJ determination, thus effectively precluded the State from reinstating gubernatorial appointment, the only practice consistent with the Alabama Constitution pre-2006.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Indeed, Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s counsel forthrightly acknowledged that the position she defends would \xe2\x80\x9cloc[k] into place\xe2\x80\x9d an unconstitutional practice.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent, too, appears to concede that its reading of \xc2\xa75 would bind Alabama to an unconstitutional practice because of an error by the state trial court.  See <em>post</em>, at 7.  But it contends that this imposition is no more \xe2\x80\x9coffensive to state sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively requiring a State to administer a law it has repealed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x94a routine consequence of \xc2\xa75.  The result described by the dissent, however, follows directly from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that a state law may not be enforced if it conflicts with federal law.  See Art. VI, cl. 2.  Section 5 prohibits States from making retrogressive changes to their voting practices, and thus renders any such changes unenforceable.  To be sure, this result constrains States\xe2\x80\x99 legislative freedom.  But the rule advocated by the dissent would effectively preclude Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court from applying to a state law a provision of the State Constitution entirely harmonious with federal law.  That sort of interference with a state supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to determine the content of state law, we think it plain, is a burden of a different order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This burden is more than a hypothetical concern.  The realities of election litigation are such that lower state courts often allow elections to proceed based on erroneous interpretations of state law later corrected on appeal.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Akins </em>v. <em>Secretary of State</em>, 154 N.\xc2\xa0H. 67, 67\xe2\x80\x9368, 74, 904 A.\xc2\xa02d 702, 703, 708 (2006) (preelection challenge rejected by a state trial court but eventually sustained in a postelection decision by the State Supreme Court); <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>State Canvassing Bd.</em>, 2006\xe2\x80\x93NMSC\xe2\x80\x93034, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb61\xe2\x80\x9317, 140 N.\xc2\xa0M. 77, 79\xe2\x80\x9383 (2006) (same); <em>Maryland Green Party </em>v. <em>Maryland Bd. of Elections</em>, 377 Md. 127, 137\xe2\x80\x93139, 832 A.\xc2\xa02d 214, 220\xe2\x80\x93221 (2003) (same); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan </em>v. <em>State</em>, 914 P.\xc2\xa02d 1250, 1263\xe2\x80\x931264 (Alaska 1996) (same); <em>Peloza </em>v. <em>Freas</em>, 871 P.\xc2\xa02d 687, 688, 692 (Alaska 1994) (same).  We decline to adopt a rigid interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d that would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to correct similar errors in the future.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although our reasoning and the particular facts of this case should make the narrow scope of our holding apparent, we conclude with some cautionary observations.  First, the presence of a judgment by Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s highest court declaring the 1985 Act invalid under the State Constitution is critical to our decision.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We do not suggest the outcome would be the same if a potentially unlawful practice had simply been abandoned by state officials after initial use in an election.  Cf. <em>Perkins</em>, 400 U. S., at 395.  Second, the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was invoked and struck down shortly thereafter.  The same result would not necessarily follow if a practice were invalidated only after enforcement without challenge in several previous elections.  Cf. <em>Young</em>, 520 U. S., at 283 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under state law does not show, entirely by itself, that the practice was never \xe2\x80\x98in force or effect.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 A State, after all, might maintain in effect for many years a plan that technically \xe2\x80\xa6 violated some provision of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Finally, the consequence of the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Stokes</em> was to reinstate a practice\xe2\x80\x94gubernatorial appointment\xe2\x80\x94identical to the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 baseline.  Preclearance might well have been required had the court instead ordered the State to adopt a novel practice.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 577; Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, 96 Stat. 131; Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. 400; Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 314.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under the Alabama Constitution, a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d law is \xe2\x80\x9ca law which in its terms and effect applies either to the whole state, or to one or more municipalities of the state less than the whole in a class.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa7110.

See 445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1336.  This formulation, we conclude, misstates the issue in two technical respects.  First, \xc2\xa75 requires a covered jurisdiction to seek preclearance of any changed \xe2\x80\x9cpractice \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

That practice, and not the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of state law in <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Kennedy</em>, is the proper subject of the \xc2\xa75 inquiry.  Second, as Governor Riley noted, see Brief for Appellant 25, if there was a change requiring preclearance, it came about as a result of <em>Stokes</em>, not <em>Kennedy</em>.  <em>Stokes</em> held that the 1985 Act violated the Alabama Constitution, and the State accordingly reinstated the practice of gubernatorial appointment with the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s 1988 appointment of Jones.  <em>Kennedy</em> simply determined that the 2004 Act did not resurrect the 1985 Act; that decision itself prompted no change in the State\xe2\x80\x99s election practices.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0By its terms, \xc2\xa75 requires preclearance of any election practice that is \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from that in force or effect on\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant coverage date\xe2\x80\x94in this case, November 1, 1964.  42 U.

See Brief for Appellant 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  In response, Kennedy and the United States noted that the DOJ, see 28 CFR \xc2\xa751.12 (2007), and the lower courts to consider the question, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>NAACP, DeKalb Cty. Chapter </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, 494 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 668, 677 (ND Ga. 1980) (three-judge court), have rejected this interpretation.

I think it clear, as the Department of Justice argues and the three-judge District Court held, 445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1333 (MD Ala. 2006), that the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Stokes</em> v. <em>Noonan</em>, 534 So.\xc2\xa02d 237 (1988), caused a change in voting practice that required preclearance.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 5 preclearance is required \xe2\x80\x9c[w]henever a [covered] State \xe2\x80\xa6 shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

The critical question in this case is whether the procedure for selecting Mobile County Commissioners arising out of <em>Stokes</em>\xe2\x80\x94gubernatorial appointment\xe2\x80\x94is a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa75.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the language of \xc2\xa75 requires that the practice be \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is undisputed that the practice in force or effect in 1964 was gubernatorial appointment, see Ala.

Acts no. 85\xe2\x80\x93237.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument that a return to gubernatorial appointment will never require preclearance under \xc2\xa75 because gubernatorial appointment was the practice in effect in 1964 is neither persuasive nor properly before the Court.  Appellant expressly abandoned any such argument in his briefs to this Court.  See Reply Brief 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur contention, as we have already said, is not that the Court needs to rethink prior dicta suggesting that, despite its language, \xc2\xa75 operates like a ratchet to subsume newly-precleared practices\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

Reflecting the fact that Congress certainly did not intend \xc2\xa75 to create a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor\xe2\x80\x9d for voting practices identical to practices in effect in 1964, the settled understanding among lower courts and the Department of Justice is that \xc2\xa75 operates instead as a ratchet, freezing in place the most recent voting practice.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (collecting cases); 28 CFR \xc2\xa751.12 (2007).

The Secretary of State told at least one election official to begin registering voters under the new plan.  The proposed changes were precleared, and about 4,000 voters were registered.  The legislature failed to adopt the proposal, however, and the registrants were notified that they were not, as they had thought, registered to vote in state or local elections.  <em>Fordice</em>, 520 U.

We held that the provisional registration system was not the baseline because it was never in force or effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An ordinary observer asked to describe voting practice in Alabama with respect to the method of filling vacancies on the Mobile County Commission would no doubt state that before 1985 the practice was gubernatorial appointment, between 1985 and 1988 the practice was special election, and beginning in 1988 the practice changed to gubernatorial appointment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of this history, the Court comes to the startling conclusion that for purposes of the VRA Alabama has never ceased to practice gubernatorial appointment as its method of selecting members of the Mobile County Commission.  But under our case law interpreting \xc2\xa75, it is clear that a change occurred in 1988 when <em>Stokes </em>returned Alabama to gubernatorial appointment.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  This represented a change because the relevant baseline was the special election procedure mandated by the Alabama Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of the 1985 Act, which was precleared by the Department of Justice in June 1985.  Pursuant to that law, the Governor called a special election when a vacancy arose in 1987.  The vacancy was filled and the newly elected commissioner took office in July 1987 serving, by way of his election, until September 1988. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to say that the special election practice was never \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d with a straight face.  Jones was elected and sat on the three-member Mobile County Commission for approximately 14 months.  During those 14 months, the County Commission held dozens of meetings, at which the Commission exercised its executive and administrative functions.  During the time he served as a result of the special election, Jones was central to actions having a direct and immediate impact on Mobile County.  For example, at a meeting held on October 13, 1987, the Commission considered 25 agenda items, one of which was paying claims and payrolls of over $1 million.  Minutes from Meeting Oct. 13, 1987.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The differences between this case and <em>Fordice</em> are legion.  In holding that the provisional registration system in <em>Fordice</em> did not constitute the baseline by which to measure future practices, we emphasized that the plan was abandoned as soon as it was clear that it would not be enacted, the plan was in use for only 41 days, and only about one-third of the election officials had even implemented the proposal.  520 U. S., at 283.  Further, the State rectified the situation far in advance of any elections; there was no evidence that anyone was prevented from voting because of reliance on the rejected plan.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fordice</em> was in essence a case of \xe2\x80\x9cno harm, no foul.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, of course, the special election <em>did take place</em> and the elected commissioner held his post for 14 months, voting on hundreds of measures shaping the governance of Mobile County.  While the voters in <em>Fordice</em> could be reregistered under the new procedures, Jones\xe2\x80\x99 election to the Commission and his 14-month service cannot be undone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seems to acknowledge that <em>Fordice</em> is distinguishable, stating that if \xe2\x80\x9cthe only relevant factors were the length of time a practice was in use and the extent to which it was implemented, this would be a close case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  The Court relies, however, on the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d that the 1985 Act was challenged immediately and that the 1987 election was held \xe2\x80\x9cin the shadow\xe2\x80\x9d of that legal challenge.  <em>Ante, </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But a cloud of litigation cannot undermine the obvious conclusion that the special election practice was in force or effect.  That practice, therefore, is the practice to which gubernatorial appointment must be compared.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority makes much of the fact that to adopt the view of the three-judge District Court would make the question whether a voting practice is \xe2\x80\x9cin force or effect\xe2\x80\x9d turn on whether the circuit court happened to get the law right in time to stop the election.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach turns instead on whether Alabama possesses highly motivated private litigants.  If Stokes had not challenged the election until it had already taken place (or had failed to appeal), the election <em>would be</em> in force or effect under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Nothing in the VRA or our cases suggests that the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s application should hinge on how quickly private litigants challenge voting laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decisions in <em>Perkins</em> and <em>Lockhart</em> give no indication that if a citizen in Canton, Mississippi or Lockhart, Texas had challenged the legality of the ward elections or the numbered-post system, the illegality of those practices under state law would have been any more relevant to their status as the relevant baselines.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our precedent; that precedent makes clear that the special election procedure was the relevant baseline and that gubernatorial appointment therefore represents a change that must be precleared.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The VRA makes no distinction among the paths that can lead to a change in voting practice, requiring preclearance \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever\xe2\x80\x9d a State seeks to enact \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d change in voting practice.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c.  And changes to voting practice can arise in at least four ways: (1) legislative enactment; (2) executive action; (3) judicial changes, either by a proactive judicial decision (<em>e.g.,</em> redistricting) or, as in this case, through judicial interpretation of state law; or (4) informal abandonment or adoption by election officials. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not dispute that a change in voting practice wrought by a state court can be subject to preclearance.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11 (citing <em>Branch</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/254/index.html">538 U. S. 254</a> (2003), and <em>Hathorn</em> v. <em>Lovorn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/255/index.html">457 U. S. 255</a> (1982)).  But the majority falters when it treats the change effected by <em>Stokes</em> differently for \xc2\xa75 preclearance purposes than it would treat a newly enacted statute or executive regulation.  The majority finds it \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d that Alabama might be bound \xe2\x80\x9cto an unconstitutional practice because of a state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  The clear theme running through the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is that the Alabama Supreme Court is more deserving of comity than the Alabama Legislature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Imagine that the 1985 Act had been held constitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Stokes</em>, but that in 1988 the Alabama Legislature changed its mind and repealed the Act, enacting in its place a statute providing for gubernatorial appointment.  Imagine further that the Department of Justice refused to preclear the practice (as it no doubt would); if Alabama wanted to fill an open seat on the Mobile County Commission it would have to administer its former special election practice even though that law had been repealed.  It is not clear to me or to the United States, see Brief as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25\xe2\x80\x9327, why effectively requiring a State to administer a law it has repealed is less offensive to state sovereignty than requiring a State to administer a law its highest court has found unconstitutional.  The VRA \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature, intrudes on state sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Monterey County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/266/index.html">525 U. S. 266</a>, 284 (1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to portray the circuit court judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision as so far outside the bounds of Alabama law, see <em>ante</em>, at 17, that allowing it to effectively establish the special election practice as a \xc2\xa75 baseline would be intolerable.  I am certain, however, that the two Alabama Supreme Court Justices dissenting in <em>Stokes </em>would disagree.  534 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 239 (opinion of Steagall, J., joined by Adams, J.).  The dissenting Justices argued that the 1985 Act was sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9camendatory\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid the requirements of <em>Peddycoart</em> v. <em>Birmingham</em>, 354 So.\xc2\xa02d 808 (Ala. 1978), because it merely amended the 1957 Act creating the Mobile County Commission.  The Circuit Court Judge followed similar reasoning, citing Alabama Supreme Court precedent stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the duty of the courts to sustain the constitutionality of a legislative act unless it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that it is in violation of the fundamental law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stokes</em> v. <em>Noonan</em>, CV\xe2\x80\x9387\xe2\x80\x93001316 (Mobile County, May 19, 1987).  Nothing in the circuit court judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision indicates that this case calls for anything other than a straightforward application of our precedent.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the history of the voting practices that the VRA sought to address, especially in Alabama itself, indicates that state courts must be treated on the same terms as state legislatures for \xc2\xa75 purposes.  Specifically, the history of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s voter registration requirements makes this quite clear.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s literacy test originated in a constitutional convention called in 1901 \xe2\x80\x9clargely, if not principally, for the purpose of changing the 1875 Constitution so as to eliminate Negro voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, 252 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 95, 98 (MD Ala. 1966); see also M.\xc2\xa0McMillian, Constitutional Development in Alabama, 1789\xe2\x80\x931901, pp. 217\xe2\x80\x93232 (1955); <em>Hunter</em> v. <em>Underwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/222/index.html">471 U.

For example, in <em>Hawkins</em> v. <em>Vines</em>, 249 Ala. 165, 30 So. 2d 451 (1947), the Alabama Supreme Court rejected a petition from a denial of registration because the petitioner averred that he \xe2\x80\x9cis a citizen of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis able to read and write,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis over the age of twenty-one years,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than expressly stating that he met those requirements at the time he attempted to register.  <em>Id.,</em> at 169, 30 S. 2d, at 455 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).

Not easily deterred, the legislature responded with a new amendment, ratified in December 1951, which provided that the Alabama Supreme Court would promulgate a uniform questionnaire to be completed by all applicants.

In 1960, in response to the efforts of African-American organizations to educate voters, the questions were arranged in different sequences for different questionnaires.  B. Landsberg, Free at Last to Vote: The Alabama Origins of the 1965 Voting Rights Act 19 (2007).  These new questionnaires had the effect of blocking the registration of thousands of African-American voters.  For example, as a district court in Alabama found, between 1954 and 1960 only 14 African-Americans were registered to vote in Dallas County\xe2\x80\x94a county with approximately 15,000 African-Americans.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Atkins</em>, 323 F.\xc2\xa02d 733, 736 (CA5 1963).  Among the African-Americans denied registration were two doctors and six college graduates.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Alabama Supreme Court responded to the litigation surrounding its questionnaire by drafting a new questionnaire in 1964; that questionnaire had a literacy and civics test on which questions were rotated, resulting in 100 different forms of the test.  E. Yadlosky, Library of Congress Legislative Reference Service, State Literacy Tests as Qualifications for Voting 19 (1965).  The tests contained questions such as \xe2\x80\x9cAmbassadors may be named by the President without the approval of the United States Senate.

While I do not wish to cast aspersions on the current members of the Alabama Supreme Court or the court that decided <em>Stokes</em> v. <em>Noonan</em>, 534 So.\xc2\xa02d 237, the history of the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s role in designing Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s literacy test provides a vivid illustration of why voting changes wrought by state-court decisions must be treated on the same terms as those brought into effect by legislative or executive action.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is simply nothing about this case that takes it outside the ordinary reach of our VRA precedents.
