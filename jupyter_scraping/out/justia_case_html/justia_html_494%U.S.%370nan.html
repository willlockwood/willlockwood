We hold that they are.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Richard Boyde was found guilty by a jury in the robbery, kidnaping, and murder of Dickie Gibson, the night clerk at a 7-Eleven Store in Riverside, California.  The State introduced evidence at trial that about 2:30 a.m. on January 15, 1981, Boyde entered the store and robbed the clerk at gunpoint of $33 from the cash register.  Petitioner then </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 494 U. S. 373</a></p><p> forced Gibson into a waiting car, which was driven by petitioner\'s nephew, and the three men drove to a nearby orange grove.  There, Boyde brought Gibson into the grove and ordered him to kneel down with his hands behind his head.  As Gibson begged for his life, Boyde shot him once in the back of the head and again in the forehead, killing him.  The jury returned a special verdict that Boyde personally committed the homicide with "express malice aforethought and premeditation and deliberation."</p>\n<p>At the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was instructed, <em>inter alia,</em> in accordance with instructions 8.84.1 and 8.84.2, 1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal (4th ed. 1979) (CALJIC), both of which have since been amended.  The former lists 11 factors that the jury "shall consider, take into account and be guided by" in determining whether to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The eleventh is a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 494 U. S. 374</a></p><p> "catch-all," factor (k), which reads:  "Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The court\'s concluding instruction, pursuant to CALJIC 8.84.2, again told the jury to consider all applicable aggravating and mitigating circumstances and followed with this direction:</p>\n<p>"If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you <em>shall impose</em> a sentence of death.  However, if you determine that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you <em>shall impose</em> a sentence of confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole."</p>\n<p>(emphasis added). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  After hearing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 494 U. S. 375</a></p><p> six days of testimony concerning the appropriate penalty, the jury returned a verdict imposing the sentence of death, and the trial court denied Boyde\'s motion to reduce the sentence.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Supreme Court of California affirmed.  46 Cal.3d 212, 250 Cal.Rptr. 83, 758 P.2d 25 (1988).  It rejected petitioner\'s contention that the jury instructions violated the Eighth Amendment because the so-called "unadorned version" of factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider mitigating evidence of his background and character.  The court noted that all of the defense evidence at the penalty phase related to Boyde\'s background and character, that the jury was instructed to consider "<em>all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case,\'" and that the prosecutor "never suggested that the background and character evidence could not be considered."  <em>Id.</em> at 251, 250 Cal.Rptr. at 105, 758 P.2d at 47.  Therefore, the court found it\n</em></p>\n<p>"inconceivable the jury would have believed that, though it was permitted to hear defendant\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 494 U. S. 376</a></p><p> background and character evidence and his attorney\'s lengthy argument concerning that evidence, it could not consider that evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>With regard to the "shall impose" language of CALJIC 8.84.2, the court agreed with petitioner that the instruction could not permissibly require a juror to vote for the death penalty</p>\n<p>""unless, upon completion of the <em>weighing\' process, he decides that death is the appropriate penalty under all the circumstances."" </em></p>\n<p>46 Cal.3d at 253, 250 Cal.Rptr. at 106, 758 P.2d at 48 (quoting <em>People v. Brown,</em> 40 Cal.3d 512, 541, 230 Cal.Rptr. 834, 849, 726 P.2d 516, 531 (1985)).  It concluded, however, that in this case "[t]he jury was adequately informed as to its discretion in determining whether death was the appropriate penalty."  46 Cal.3d at 253, 250 Cal.Rptr. at 106, 758 P.2d at 48.  Three justices dissented from the court\'s affirmance of the death sentence.  The dissenters argued that the mandatory feature of instruction 8.84.2 misled the jury into believing that it was required to impose the death penalty if the aggravating factors "outweighed" the mitigating factors, even though an individual juror might not have thought death was the appropriate penalty in this case.  <em>Id.</em> at 257-266, 250 Cal.Rptr. at 109-115, 758 P.2d at 51-57.  We granted certiorari, 490 U.S. 1097, (1989), and now affirm.</p>\n<p>Petitioner reiterates in this Court his argument that the mandatory nature of former CALJIC 8.84.2 resulted in a sentencing proceeding that violated the Eighth Amendment, because the instruction prevented the jury from making an "individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty."  <em>See Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U. S. 302</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#319">492 U. S. 319</a></span>, (1989).  Specifically, Boyde contends that the "shall impose" language of the jury instruction precluded the jury from evaluating the "absolute weight" of the aggravating circumstances and determining whether they justified the death penalty.  He further asserts that the jury was prevented from deciding whether, in light of all the aggravating and mitigating evidence, death was the appropriate penalty.  In response, the State argues that the sentencing proceeding was consistent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 494 U. S. 377</a></p><p> with the Eighth Amendment, because a reasonable juror would interpret the instruction as allowing for the exercise of discretion and moral judgment about the appropriate penalty in the process of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p>We need not discuss petitioner\'s claim at length, because we conclude that it is foreclosed by our decision earlier this Term in <em>Blystone v. Pennsylvania, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/case.html">494 U. S. 299</a></span> (1990).  In <em>Blystone,</em> we rejected a challenge to an instruction with similar mandatory language, holding that</p>\n<p>"[t]he requirement of individualized sentencing in capital cases is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/case.html#307">494 U. S. 307</a></span>.  Although Blystone, unlike Boyde, did not present any mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his capital trial, the legal principle we expounded in <em>Blystone</em> clearly requires rejection of Boyde\'s claim as well, because the mandatory language of CALJIC 8.84.2 is not alleged to have interfered with the consideration of mitigating evidence.  Petitioner suggests that the jury must have freedom to decline to impose the death penalty even if the jury decides that the aggravating circumstances "outweigh" the mitigating circumstances.  But there is no such constitutional requirement of unfettered sentencing discretion in the jury, and States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence "in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty."  <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/case.html">487 U. S. 164</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/case.html#181">487 U. S. 181</a></span> (1988) (plurality opinion).  Petitioner\'s claim that the "shall impose" language of CALJIC 8.84.2 unconstitutionally prevents "individualized assessment" by the jury is thus without merit.</p>\n<p>The second issue in this case is whether petitioner\'s capital sentencing proceedings violated the Eighth Amendment because the trial court instructed the jury in accordance with former CALJIC 8.84.1, including the "unadorned" factor (k).  The Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 494 U. S. 378</a></p><p> offered by petitioner.  <em>See Lockett v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html">438 U. S. 586</a></span> (1978); <em>Eddings v.

S. 146</a></span>-147.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that none of the 11 statutory factors in CALJIC 8.84.1 allowed the jury to consider non-crime-related factors, such as his background and character, which might provide a basis for a sentence less than death.  Nine of the factors, he argues, focused only on the immediate circumstances of the crime itself.  Two others, factors (b) and (c), which center on the presence or absence of prior violent criminal activity and prior felony convictions, were in petitioner\'s view simply vehicles for the consideration of aggravating evidence not directly related to the crime.  Finally, petitioner claims that the "catchall" factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider and give effect to non-crime-related mitigating evidence, because its language -- "[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime" -- limited the jury to other evidence that was <em>related to the crime.</em></p>\n<p>The legal standard for reviewing jury instructions claimed to restrict impermissibly a jury\'s consideration of relevant evidence is less than clear from our cases.  In <em>Francis v. Franklin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/case.html">471 U. S. 307</a></span> (1985), we said that "[t]he question . . . is . . . what a reasonable juror <em>could have understood</em> the charge as meaning."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/case.html#315">471 U.

But our subsequent decisions, while sometimes purporting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 494 U.

Our cases, understandably, do not provide a single standard for determining whether various claimed errors in instructing a jury require reversal of a conviction.  In some instances, to be sure, we have held that "when a case is submitted to the jury on alternative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 494 U. S. 380</a></p><p> theories the unconstitutionality of any of the theories requires that the conviction be set aside.  <em>See, e.g., Stromberg v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/359/case.html">283 U. S. 359</a></span> (1931)."  <em>Leary v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/6/case.html">395 U. S. 6</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/6/case.html#31">395 U. S. 31</a></span>-32 (1969); <em>see also Bachellar v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/564/case.html">397 U.

In those cases, a jury is clearly instructed by the court that it may convict a defendant on an impermissible legal theory, as well as on a proper theory or theories.  Although it is possible that the guilty verdict may have had a proper basis, "it is equally likely that the verdict . . . rested on an unconstitutional ground," <em>Bachellar, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/564/case.html#571">397 U. S. 571</a></span> and we have declined to choose between two such likely possibilities.</p>\n<p>In this case, we are presented with a single jury instruction.  The instruction is not concededly erroneous, nor found so by a court, as was the case in <em>Stromberg, supra.</em>  The claim is that the instruction is ambiguous and therefore subject to an erroneous interpretation.  We think the proper inquiry in such a case is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.  Although a defendant need not establish that the jury was more likely than not to have been impermissibly inhibited by the instruction, a capital sentencing proceeding is not inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment if there is only a possibility of such an inhibition.  This "reasonable likelihood" standard, we think, better accommodates the concerns of finality and accuracy than does a standard which makes the inquiry dependent on how a single hypothetical "reasonable" juror could or might have interpreted the instruction.  There is, of course, a strong policy in favor of accurate determination of the appropriate sentence in a capital case, but there is an equally strong policy against retrials years after the first trial where the claimed error amounts to no more than speculation. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Jurors do not sit in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 494 U. S. 381</a></p><p> solitary isolation booths parsing instructions for subtle shades of meaning in the same way that lawyers might.  Differences among them in interpretation of instructions may be thrashed out in the deliberative process, with commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting.</p>\n<p>Applying this standard to factor (k) of CALJIC 8.84.1, standing alone, we think there is not a reasonable likelihood that Boyde\'s jurors interpreted the trial court\'s instructions to prevent consideration of mitigating evidence of background and character.  The jury was instructed, according to factor (k), that</p>\n<p>"you shall consider . . . [a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,"</p>\n<p>and the term "extenuate" was defined by the court to mean "to lessen the seriousness of a crime as by giving an excuse."  App. 34.  Petitioner contends that this instruction did not permit the jury to give effect to evidence -- presented by psychologists, family, and friends -- of his impoverished and deprived childhood, his inadequacies as a school student, and his strength of character in the face of these obstacles.  But as we explained last </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 494 U. S. 382</a></p><p> Term in <em>Penry v. Lynaugh,</em></p>\n<p>"\'evidence about the defendant\'s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, <em>may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse.</em>\'"</p>\n<p><em>Penry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#319">492 U. S. 319</a></span> (quoting <em>California v. Brown, supra,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#545">479 U. S. 545</a></span> (concurring opinion)) (emphasis added).  Petitioner had an opportunity through factor (k) to argue that his background and character "extenuated" or "excused" the seriousness of the crime, and we see no reason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the view, "long held by society," that in an appropriate case such evidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than death.  The instruction did not, as petitioner seems to suggest, limit the jury\'s consideration to "any other circumstance <em>of the crime</em> which extenuates the gravity of the crime."  The jury was directed to consider <em>any other circumstance</em> that might excuse the crime, which certainly includes a defendant\'s background and character. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 494 U. S. 383</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Even were the language of the instruction less clear than we think, the context of the proceedings would have led reasonable jurors to believe that evidence of petitioner\'s background and character could be considered in mitigation.  Other factors listed in CALJIC 8.84.1 allow for consideration of mitigating evidence not associated with the crime itself, such as the absence of prior criminal activity by a defendant, the absence of prior felony convictions, and youth.  When factor (k) is viewed together with those instructions, it seems even more improbable that jurors would arrive at an interpretation that precludes consideration of all non-crime-related evidence.</p>\n<p>All of the defense evidence presented at the penalty phase -- four days of testimony consuming over 400 pages of trial transcript -- related to petitioner\'s background and character, and we think it unlikely that reasonable jurors would believe the court\'s instructions transformed all of this "favorable testimony into a virtual charade."  <em>California v. Brown,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#542">479 U. S. 542</a></span>.  The jury was instructed that it "<em>shall consider all of the evidence</em> which has been received during any part of the trial of this case," App. 33 (emphasis added), and in our view reasonable jurors surely would not have felt constrained by the factor (k) instruction to <em>ignore all</em> of the evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 494 U. S. 384</a></p><p> presented by petitioner during the sentencing phase.  Presentation of mitigating evidence alone, of course, does not guarantee that a jury will feel entitled to consider that evidence.  But the introduction without objection of volumes of mitigating evidence certainly is relevant to deciding how a jury would understand an instruction which is at worst ambiguous.  This case is unlike those instances where we have found broad descriptions of the evidence to be considered insufficient to cure statutes or instructions which clearly directed the sentencer to disregard evidence.  <em>See, e.g., Hitchcock v. Dugger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/393/case.html">481 U.

But arguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court.  The former are usually billed in advance to the jury as matters of argument, not evidence, <em>see</em> Tr. 3933, and are likely viewed as the statements of advocates; the latter, we have often recognized, are viewed as definitive and binding statements of the law.  <em>See Carter v.

Petitioner maintains that the prosecutor encouraged an intolerably narrow view of factor (k) when he argued to the jury that the mitigating evidence did not "suggest that [petitioner\'s] crime is less serious or that the gravity of the crime is any less," App. 24, and that "[n]othing I have heard lessens the seriousness of this crime."  <em>Id.</em> at 29.  But we agree with the Supreme Court of California, which was without dissent on this point; that,</p>\n<p>"[a]lthough the prosecutor argued that in his view the evidence did not sufficiently mitigate Boyde\'s conduct, he never suggested that the background and character evidence could not be considered."</p>\n<p>46 Cal.3d at 251, 250 Cal.Rptr. at 105, 758 P.2d at 47.  His principal tack was not to contend that background and character were irrelevant, but to urge the jury that despite petitioner\'s past difficulties, he must accept responsibility for his actions.  <em>See</em> App. 28-30.  Indeed, the prosecutor explicitly assumed petitioner\'s character evidence was a proper factor in the weighing process, but argued that it was minimal in relation to the aggravating circumstances:</p>\n<p>"The Defendant can dance.  The Defendant . . . may have some artistic talent.  The Defendant may, in fact, have been good with children.  During the course of twenty-four years, even on a basis of just random luck, you are going to have to have picked up something or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 494 U.

Defense counsel also stressed a broad reading of factor (k) in his argument to the jury:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is almost a catchall phrase.  Any other circumstance, and it means just that, any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse."</p>\n<p>App. 31. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, we conclude there is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurors in petitioner\'s case understood the challenged instructions to preclude consideration of relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.  We thus hold that the giving of the jury instructions at issue in this case, former CALJIC 8.84.1 and 8.84.2, did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

To receive a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a defendant must demonstrate that the evidence would more likely than not lead to a different outcome.  <em>See INS v.

But the jury was instructed to consider any circumstance which "<em>extenuates</em> the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime" or "lessens the seriousness of a crime <em>as by giving an excuse.</em>"  The instruction directs the jury to consider "any other circumstance" which might provide such an excuse, and we think jurors would naturally consider background and character as a possible excuse.</p>\n<p>At oral argument (though not in his brief), counsel for petitioner also argued that testimony that Boyde won a prize for his dance choreography while in prison showed that he could lead a useful life behind bars, and that the jury must be able to consider that evidence as a mitigating circumstance under our decision in <em>Skipper v. South Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/case.html">476 U. S. 1</a></span> (1986).  Factor (k), he argued, did not allow for such consideration.  In <em>Skipper,</em> we held that a capital defendant must be permitted to introduce in mitigation evidence of post-crime good prison behavior to show that he would not pose a danger to the prison community if sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death.  The testimony that petitioner had won a dance contest while in prison, however, was introduced not to demonstrate that he was a "model prisoner" like Skipper, and therefore unlikely to present a risk of future dangerousness, but to show that he had artistic ability.  Tr. 4607-4608.  Moreover, although the record is not clear on this point, petitioner apparently won the dance prize during a prison term served <em>prior</em> to the Gibson murder, and the evidence thus did not pertain to prison behavior after the crime for which he was sentenced to death, as was the case in <em>Skipper.</em>  The testimony about dancing ability was presented as part of petitioner\'s overall strategy to portray himself as less culpable than other defendants, due to his disadvantaged background and his character strengths in the face of those difficulties.  As with other evidence of good character, therefore, the jury had the opportunity to conclude through factor (k) that petitioner\'s dancing ability extenuated the gravity of the crime because it showed that Boyde\'s criminal conduct was an aberration from otherwise good character.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>We find no merit to the contention of petitioner and <em>amicus</em> that arguments of prosecutors in <em>other</em> California cases bear on the validity of the factor (k) instruction in this case.

Nor do we think the fact that prosecutors in other cases may have pressed a construction of factor (k) that would cause the sentencing proceedings to violate the Eighth Amendment means that reasonable jurors are likely to have arrived at an such an interpretation.  Prosecutors are interested advocates, and the arguments that one or more prosecutors may have made in urging a particular construction of factor (k) in other cases is not a weighty factor in deciding whether the jury in petitioner\'s case would have felt precluded from considering mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, and with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice STEVENS join as to Parts I, II, III, and IV, dissenting.</p>\n<p>It is a bedrock principle of our capital punishment jurisprudence that, in deciding whether to impose a sentence of death, a sentencer must consider not only the nature of the offense but also the "<em>character and propensities of the offender.\'"  </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 494 U.

Because none of these factors explicitly informed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 494 U.

The State responds that the instructions fully informed the jury of its responsibility to consider character and background evidence through factor (k), which provided that a jury could consider "[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."

The majority fails, however, to explain how the new standard differs from <em>Sandstrom</em>\'s "could have" standard other than to suggest that the new standard, unlike <em>Sandstrom</em>\'s, requires more than "speculation" to overturn a capital sentence.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It is difficult to conceive how a <em>reasonable</em> juror <em>could</em> interpret an instruction unconstitutionally where there is no "reasonable likelihood" that a juror would do so.  Indeed, if the majority did not explicitly allow for such a possibility, lower courts would have good reason to doubt that the two standards were different at all; the majority\'s more stringent version of the "reasonable likelihood" standard is inconsistent with the cases from which the majority appropriates that standard.</p>\n<p>The "reasonable likelihood" language first appeared in <em>Napue v.

The language in <em>Napue</em> thereafter provided the governing standard for determining whether a prosecutor\'s knowing use of perjured testimony mandates reversal of a sentence.  <em>See United States v.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>To the extent the Court\'s new standard does require a defendant to make a greater showing than <em>Sandstrom,</em> the malleability of the standard encourages <em>ad hoc</em> review of challenged instructions by lower courts.  Although the standard as the majority adopts it requires a defendant challenging the constitutionality of an instruction to demonstrate more than a reasonable "possibility" that his jury was "impermissibly inhibited by the instruction," a defendant "need not establish that the jury . . . more likely than not" was misled.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#380">494 U.

Thus, appellate courts, familiar with applying the <em>Sandstrom</em> standard to ambiguous instructions, are now required to speculate whether an instruction that <em>could</em> have been misunderstood creates a "reasonable likelihood" that it was in fact misunderstood.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#380">494 U.

Despite the majority\'s declaration to the contrary, our "strong policy in favor of accurate determination of the appropriate sentence in a capital case" is <em>not</em> equaled by our "strong policy against retrials" based on alleged deficiencies in jury instructions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#380">494 U.

Quite simply, the issue here is whether the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding its capital sentencing role.  Such a challenge goes to the core of the accuracy of the verdict; it asks whether the defendant was sentenced by the jury according to the law.  <em>Bollenbach v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/607/case.html">326 U.

S. 613</a></span> (1946) ("A conviction ought not to rest on an equivocal direction to the jury on a basic issue").  In such a circumstance, a capital defendant\'s interest in an exacting review of the alleged error is unquestionably at its height, because there is no "presumptive validity" regarding the jury\'s sentence.  The State, on the other hand, retains no strong reliance interest in sustaining a capital verdict that may have been obtained based on a misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p>Our refusal to apply a standard less protective than "reasonable doubt" to alleged errors in criminal trials in part guarantees the reliability of the jury\'s determination.  But it also reflects our belief that appellate courts should not "invad[e] [the] fact-finding function which in a criminal case the law assigns solely to the jury."  <em>Carella v.

To ignore a reasonable possibility that jurors were misled about the range of mitigating evidence that they could consider is to undermine confidence that the <em>jury</em> actually decided that Boyde should be sentenced to death in accordance with the law.

The majority\'s conclusion that factor (k) would be understood by reasonable jurors to permit consideration of mitigating factors unrelated to the crime does not accord with the plain meaning of the factor\'s language. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  A "circumstance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 494 U. S. 399</a></p><p> which extenuates the gravity of the crime" unambiguously refers to circumstances <em>related to the crime.</em>  Jurors, relying on ordinary language and experience, would not view the seriousness of a crime as dependent upon the background or character of the offender.  A typical juror would not, for example, describe a particular murder as "a less serious crime" because of the redeeming qualities of the murderer; surely Boyde\'s murder of Gibson could not be considered less grave, as the majority suggests, because Boyde demonstrated that his "criminal conduct was an aberration from otherwise good character," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#382">494 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Rather, an offender\'s background and character unrelated to his crime should be considered by the sentencer because of society\'s deeply felt view that punishment should reflect <em>both</em> the seriousness of a crime <em>and</em> the nature of the offender.  <em>See, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U.

According to the majority, this statement reveals that jurors could understand background and character evidence as extenuating the seriousness of a crime.  But this language does not prove what the majority would have it prove.  The language tells us, as is clear from several of our cases, that a criminal defendant may be considered <em>less culpable</em> and thus less deserving of severe punishment if he encountered unusual difficulties in his background, suffers from limited intellectual or emotional resources, or possesses redeeming qualities.  <em>See, e.g., Woodson,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#304">428 U. S. 304</a></span> (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).  The language in <em>Penry</em> does not, however, suggest that because an offender\'s culpability is lessened his crime, too, is less serious.  Rather than answering the central question of this case -- whether character and background evidence can be regarded as "extenuat[ing] the gravity of the crime" as opposed to lessening the offender\'s moral culpability -- <em>Penry</em> simply confirms that an offender\'s background and character, apart from his crime, must be considered in fixing punishment. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 494 U. S. 401</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The majority appears to rest its position on the assumption that it would be nonsensical, given society\'s "long-held" belief that character and background evidence is relevant to a sentencing determination, to conclude that the jury might have thought that it could not consider such evidence.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#381">494 U. S. 381</a></span>-382.  If the value of giving effect to such mitigating evidence is so deeply held, the assumption holds, surely the jury could not have been misled by the trial court\'s instructions.  The sad irony of the majority\'s position is that, under its reasoning, the more fundamentally rooted a legal principle is in our constitutional values, the less scrutiny we would apply to jury instructions that run counter to that principle.  For example, because</p>\n<p>"the presumption of innocence [is] that bedrock \'axiomatic and elementary\' principle whose \'enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law,\'"</p>\n<p><em>In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U.

S. 453</a></span> (1895)), the majority apparently would resolve doubts about the adequacy of a reasonable doubt instruction against the accused on the assumption that jurors share our "long held" belief in the presumption of innocence.  The majority\'s position would therefore encourage trial courts to be exacting in their instructions regarding legal minutiae but leave in barest form instructions regarding those principles "indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community in applications of the criminal law."  397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#364">397 U.

Because this argument inverts the degree of concern we should exhibit toward fundamental errors in criminal proceedings, it is unacceptable.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>As the majority maintains, the adequacy of an instruction must be judged "<em>in the context of the overall charge.\'"  </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 494 U.

Nothing in the charge here, however, overcame the constitutional inadequacy of factor (k) in failing to instruct the jury to consider all mitigating evidence.\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority suggests that factor (k), by referring to "<em>[a]ny <em>other</em> circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime\'" (emphasis added), signaled that character and background evidence could be considered because "[o]ther factors listed in CALJIC 8.84.1 allow for consideration of mitigating evidence not associated with the crime itself."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#378">494 U.

The majority thus believes that the jury would be unlikely to read a limitation into factor (k) that was not shared by all of the "other" factors to which the prefatory language in factor (k) refers.  But the "any other" language in factor (k) need not refer to all of the preceding factors; it could well refer <em>solely</em> to those factors that permit consideration of mitigating evidence related to the offense. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The understanding of the instruction must turn on the meaning of "circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime," not on factor (k)\'s prefatory language.  Because that phrase unambiguously refers to circumstances related to the crime, one cannot reasonably conclude on the basis of the scope of the other factors that the jury understood factor (k) to encompass mitigating evidence regarding Boyde\'s character and background.\n</em></p>\n<p>Equally unpersuasive is the majority\'s claim that Boyde\'s presentation of extensive background and character evidence itself suggests that the jurors were aware of their responsibility to consider and give effect to that evidence.  This argument is foreclosed by <em>Penry,</em> where we stated that</p>\n<p>"it is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.  The sentencer must also be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 494 U.

S. 319</a></span>.  Thus, mere presentation of mitigating evidence, in the absence of a mechanism for giving effect to such evidence, does not satisfy constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing this case as unlike those in which the instructions "clearly directed the sentencer to disregard evidence."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#384">494 U. S. 384</a></span>.  Implicit in this claim is the view that the Constitution is satisfied when the sentencing instructions do not explicitly preclude the jury from considering all mitigating evidence.  In other words, the Constitution provides no <em>affirmative</em> guarantee that the jury will be informed of its proper sentencing role.  This view is unsupportable.</p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Lockett,</em> faced with statutory restrictions on the consideration of mitigating evidence, framed the relevant question in that case to be whether the instructions "prevent[ed] the sentencer . . . from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant\'s character."  438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U. S. 605</a></span>.  We have understood this principle affirmatively to require the sentencing court to alert the jury to its constitutional role in capital sentencing.  Thus, in <em>Penry,</em> we overturned a death sentence because the jury was not informed that it could consider mitigating evidence regarding Penry\'s mental retardation and childhood abuse.  It was "the <em>absence</em> of instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence" that was dispositive.  492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#328">492 U.

The Court cannot fairly conclude, then, that the mere presentation of evidence satisfied Boyde\'s right to a constitutionally adequate sentencing determination.\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, in examining the context of the sentencing instructions, the majority finds "no objectionable prosecutorial argument" that would reinforce an impermissible interpretation of factor (k).  Although the prosecutor "<em>never suggested that the background and character evidence could not be considered,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#385">494 U.

Factor (k) accomplished that purpose on its own, and the prosecutor, to make his point, needed only to repeat that language to the jury.\n</em></p>\n<p>In his opening penalty phase argument to the jury, the prosecutor described some of the background and character evidence that Boyde had offered and asked rhetorically:</p>\n<p>"[D]oes this in any way relieve him or . . . in any way suggest that this crime is less serious or that the gravity of the crime is any less; I don\'t think so."</p>\n<p>App. 24.  The majority suggests that this argument merely went to the <em>weight</em> the jury should assign to Boyde\'s character and background evidence.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#385">494 U. S. 385</a></span>-386.  But the argument directly tracks the language of factor (k) specifying what evidence may be considered, not what weight should be attached to such evidence.  The argument does not suggest that Boyde\'s background and character evidence was untrue or insubstantial, but rather emphasizes that the evidence did not, indeed could not <em>in any way,</em> lessen the seriousness or the gravity of the crime itself.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor\'s closing statement likewise reinforced the message that evidence unrelated to the crime did not fall within the scope of factor (k):</p>\n<p>"If you look and you read what it says about extenuation, it says, \'To lessen the seriousness of a crime as by giving an excuse.\'  Nothing I have heard lessens the seriousness of this crime."</p>\n<p>App. 29.  Again, the prosecutor designed his argument to bring home to the jury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 494 U. S. 405</a></p><p> the plain meaning of the sentencing instructions.  That the argument focuses more on the language of factor (k) than on the substance of Boyde\'s mitigating evidence confirms that the prosecutor sought to prevent the jury from considering non-crime-related evidence.</p>\n<p>Nor is this a case in which potentially misleading prosecutorial argument can be discounted because the trial court\'s instructions satisfactorily informed the jury of its proper sentencing role.  Rather, the prosecutor exploited the constitutional inadequacy of factor (k) and sought to ensure that the limited scope of factor (k) did not escape the attention of the jury.  Thus, both the prosecutor\'s comments and the trial court\'s charge failed to communicate to the jury that it could give effect to mitigating character and background evidence.  At the very least, a reasonable juror could have understood the charge and the prosecutor\'s arguments as so limited.  Accordingly, neither the words of the charge nor the context in which they were given provide sufficient assurance that the jury considered all mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>"When the State brings a criminal action to deny a defendant liberty or life, . . ."</p>\n<p>"the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment."</p>\n<p><em>Santosky v.

The Court\'s observation that, in the case before it, the verdict was "equally likely" to be unconstitutional was just that -- an observation.  <em>See also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/564/case.html#569">397 U.

Just as the "reasonable doubt" standard at trial reflects our awareness of the meaning and serious consequences that our society attaches to a criminal conviction, the insistence on reasonable certainty in the correctness of capital sentencing instructions is commensurate with our heightened concern for accuracy in capital proceedings.  Thus, the majority\'s assertion that "there may not be great differences among these various phrasings," <em>ante</em> at ___, is unfounded.  To the contrary, in reviewing criminal judgments we have described the difference between a standard that demands reasonable certainty on the one hand, and one that tolerates significant doubt on the other, as the difference that sets apart "a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual."  <em>In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U.

Torcia, Wharton\'s Criminal Law \xc2\xa7 17, p. 81 (14th ed. 1978); <em>see also Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html#34">407 U. S. 34</a></span> (1972) ("even in prosecutions for offenses less serious than felonies, a fair trial may require the presence of a lawyer").  The characterization of felonies, which are defined by certain offense-related elements, as serious crimes <em>regardless of the nature of the offender</em> captures our intuitive sense that a crime is not made less serious by factors extrinsic to it, but <em>only</em> by circumstances surrounding the offense itself.  For similar reasons, the doctrine of justification and excuse in our criminal law focuses solely on factors related to the commission of the crime, such as duress, necessity, entrapment, and ignorance or mistake.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law, Ch. 5 (1986).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>To the extent it has spoken to the issue, this Court supports the view that circumstances that extenuate the gravity of a crime are analytically distinct from evidence regarding an offender\'s character and background.  The commitment to considering background and character evidence in our capital punishment jurisprudence is traceable, in part, through <em>Woodson</em> to the following passage in <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/51/case.html">302 U. S. 51</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/51/case.html#54">302 U. S. 54</a></span>-55 (1937) (emphasis added):</p>\n<p>"[P]unishment of like crimes may be made more severe if committed by ex-convicts. . . .  For the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense <em>together with</em> the character and propensities of the offender."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, at least seven of the ten factors preceding factor (k) -- factors (a), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (j) -- relate solely to circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/case.html#373">494 U. S. 373</a></span>-374, n. 1 (quoting complete instruction).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>For the reasons canvassed in Justice BRENNAN\'s dissent in <em>Blystone v. Pennsylvania, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/case.html">494 U. S. 299</a></span>, I also believe that the mandatory language of California\'s sentencing scheme deprives a capital defendant of an independent judgment by the sentencer that death is the appropriate punishment.  Like the instruction in <em>Blystone,</em> Boyde\'s instruction required the sentencer to deliver a verdict of death if the aggravating circumstance or circumstances, no matter how insubstantial, outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  Channeling sentencing discretion is indeed an essential aspect of a constitutional capital punishment scheme, but it should not be understood to deprive the sentencer of the choice to reject the ultimate sanction where the aggravating circumstances do not warrant it.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
