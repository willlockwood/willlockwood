The decedent, William Kennedy, participated in his employer\xe2\x80\x99s savings and investment plan (SIP), with power both to designate a beneficiary to receive the funds upon his death and to replace or revoke that designation as prescribed by the plan administrator.  Under the terms of the plan, if there is no surviving spouse or designated beneficiary at the time of death, distribution is made as directed by the estate\xe2\x80\x99s executor or administrator.  Upon their marriage, William designated Liv Kennedy his SIP beneficiary and named no contingent beneficiary.  Their subsequent divorce decree divested Liv of her interest in the SIP benefits, but William did not execute a document removing Liv as the SIP beneficiary.  On William\xe2\x80\x99s death, petitioner Kari Kennedy, his daughter and the executrix of his Estate, asked for the SIP funds to be distributed to the Estate, but the plan administrator relied on William\xe2\x80\x99s designation form and paid them to Liv.  The Estate filed suit, alleging that Liv had waived her SIP benefits in the divorce and thus respondents, the employer and the SIP plan administrator (together, DuPont), had violated ERISA by paying her.  As relevant here, the District Court entered summary judgment for the Estate, ordering DuPont to pay the benefits to the Estate.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver was an assignment or alienation of her interest to the Estate barred by \xc2\xa71056(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the SIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, her waiver did not constitute an assignment or alienation rendered void under \xc2\xa71056(d)(1).

The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s broad reading\xe2\x80\x94that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver indirectly transferred her interest to the next possible beneficiary, here the Estate\xe2\x80\x94is questionable.  It would be odd to speak of an estate as the transferee of its own decedent\xe2\x80\x99s property or of the decedent in his lifetime as his own transferee.  It would also be strange under the Treasury Regulation that defines \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calienation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, it is difficult to see how certain waivers not barred by the antialienation provision e.g., </em>a surviving spouse\xe2\x80\x99s ability to waive a survivor\xe2\x80\x99s annuity or lump-sum payment, see <em>Boggs</em> v. <em>Boggs, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/520/833/index.html">520 U.

These doubts, and exceptions calling the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading into question, point the Court toward the law of trusts that \xe2\x80\x9cserves as ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s backdrop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beck</em> v. <em>PACE Int\xe2\x80\x99l Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/96/index.html">551 U. S. 96</a>, 101.  Section 1056(d)(1) is much like a spendthrift trust provision barring assignment or alienation of a benefit, see <em>Boggs, supra, </em>at 852, and the cognate trust law is highly suggestive here.  The general principle that a designated spendthrift beneficiary can disclaim his trust interest magnifies the improbability that a statute written with an eye on the old law would effectively force a beneficiary to take an interest willy-nilly.  The Treasury reads its own regulation to mean that the antialienation provision is not violated by a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s waiver \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the beneficiary does not attempt to direct her interest in pension benefits to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18.

ERISA provides no exception to the plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s duty to act in accordance with plan documents.  Thus, the Estate\xe2\x80\x99s claim stands or falls by \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), a straightforward rule that lets employers \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98establish a uniform administrative scheme, [with] a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Egelhoff</em> v. <em>Egelhoff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/141/index.html">532 U. S. 141</a>, 148.  By giving a plan participant a clear set of instructions for making his own instructions clear, ERISA forecloses any justification for enquiries into expressions of intent, in favor of the virtues of adhering to an uncomplicated rule.  Less certain rules could force plan administrators to examine numerous external documents purporting to be waivers and draw them into litigation like this over those waivers\xe2\x80\x99 meaning and enforceability.  The guarantee of simplicity is not absolute, since a QDRO\xe2\x80\x99s enforceability may require an administrator to look for beneficiaries outside plan documents notwithstanding \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D).  But an administrator enforcing a QDRO must be said to enforce plan documents, not ignore them, and a QDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given its specific and objective criteria.  These are good and sufficient reasons for holding the line, just as the Court did in holding that ERISA preempted state laws that could blur the bright-line requirement to follow plan documents in distributing benefits.  See <em>Boggs, supra,</em> at 850, and <em>Egelhoff, supra,</em> at 143<em>.  </em>What goes for inconsistent state law goes for a federal common law of waiver that might obscure a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s duty to act \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the documents and instruments.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html">508 U. S. 248</a>, 259.  This case points out the wisdom of protecting the plan documents rule.  Under the SIP, Liv was William\xe2\x80\x99s designated beneficiary.  The plan provided a way to disclaim an interest in the SIP account, which Liv did not purport to follow.  The plan administrator therefore did exactly what \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D) required and paid Liv the benefits.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 <em>et seq</em>., generally obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing\xe2\x80\x9d them.  \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D).  At a more specific level, the Act requires covered pension benefit plans to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide that benefits \xe2\x80\xa6 under the plan may not be assigned or alienated,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71056(d)(1), but this bar does not apply to qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs), \xc2\xa71056(d)(3).  The question here is whether the terms of the limitation on assignment or alienation invalidated the act of a divorced spouse, the designated beneficiary under her ex-husband\xe2\x80\x99s ERISA pension plan, who purported to waive her entitlement by a federal common law waiver embodied in a divorce decree that was not a QDRO.  We hold that such a waiver is not rendered invalid by the text of the antialienation provision, but that the plan administrator properly disregarded the waiver owing to its conflict with the designation made by the former husband in accordance with plan documents.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decedent, William Kennedy, worked for E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company and was a participant in its savings and investment plan (SIP), with power both to \xe2\x80\x9cdesignate any beneficiary or beneficiaries \xe2\x80\xa6 to receive all or part\xe2\x80\x9d of the funds upon his death, and to \xe2\x80\x9creplace or revoke such designation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 48<em>.</em>  The plan requires \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll authorizations, designations and requests concerning the Plan [to] be made by employees in the manner prescribed by the [plan administrator],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 52, and provides forms for designating or changing a beneficiary, <em>id.</em>, at 34, 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  If at the time the participant dies \xe2\x80\x9cno surviving spouse exists and no beneficiary designation is in effect, distribution shall be made to, or in accordance with the directions of, the executor or administrator of the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SIP is an ERISA \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98employee pension benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 426, 427 (CA5 2007); 29 U.

William did not, however, execute any documents removing Liv as the SIP beneficiary, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 428, even though he did execute a new beneficiary-designation form naming his daughter, Kari Kennedy, as the beneficiary under DuPont\xe2\x80\x99s Pension and Retirement Plan, also governed by ERISA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On William\xe2\x80\x99s death in 2001, petitioner Kari Kennedy was named executrix and asked DuPont to distribute the SIP funds to William\xe2\x80\x99s Estate.  <em>Ibid</em>.  DuPont, instead, relied on William\xe2\x80\x99s designation form and paid the balance of some $400,000 to Liv.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Estate then sued respondents DuPont and the SIP plan administrator (together, DuPont), claiming that the divorce decree amounted to a waiver of the SIP benefits on Liv\xe2\x80\x99s part, and that DuPont had violated ERISA by paying the benefits to William\xe2\x80\x99s designee.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So far as it matters here, the District Court entered summary judgment for the Estate, to which it ordered DuPont to pay the value of the SIP benefits.  The court relied on Fifth Circuit precedent establishing that a beneficiary can waive his rights to the proceeds of an ERISA plan \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provided that the waiver is explicit, voluntary, and made in good faith.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38 (quoting <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Hayes</em>, 212 F.\xc2\xa03d 866, 874 (CA5 2000)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit nonetheless reversed, distinguishing prior decisions enforcing federal common law waivers of ERISA benefits because they involved life-insurance policies, which are considered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98welfare plan[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA and consequently free of the antialienation provision.  497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 429.  The Court of Appeals held that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver constituted an assignment or alienation of her interest in the SIP benefits to the Estate, and so could not be honored.  <em>Id.</em>, at 430.  The court relied heavily on the ERISA provision for bypassing the antialienation provision when a marriage breaks up: under 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71056(d)(3),[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] a court order that satisfies certain statutory requirements is known as a qualified domestic relations order, which is exempt from the bar on assignment or alienation.  Because the Kennedys\xe2\x80\x99 divorce decree was not a QDRO, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that it could not give effect to Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver incorporated in it, given that \xe2\x80\x9cERISA provides a specific mechanism\xe2\x80\x94the QDRO\xe2\x80\x94for addressing the elimination of a spouse\xe2\x80\x99s interest in plan benefits, but that mechanism is <em>not </em>invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 431.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts over a divorced spouse\xe2\x80\x99s ability to waive pension plan benefits through a divorce decree not amounting to a QDRO.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  552 U. S. ___ (2008).  We subsequently realized that this case implicates the further split over whether a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s federal common law waiver of plan benefits is effective where that waiver is inconsistent with plan documents,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and after oral argument we invited supplemental briefing on that latter issue, upon which the disposition of this case ultimately turns.  We now affirm, albeit on reasoning different from the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By its terms, the antialienation provision, \xc2\xa71056(d)(1), requires a plan to provide expressly that benefits be neither \xe2\x80\x9cassigned\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9calienated,\xe2\x80\x9d the operative verbs having histories of legal meaning:  to \xe2\x80\x9cassign\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o transfer; as to assign property, or some interest therein,\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 152 (4th rev. ed. 1968), and to \xe2\x80\x9calienate\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o convey; to transfer the title to property,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 96.  We think it fair to say that Liv did not assign or alienate anything to William or to the Estate later standing in his shoes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit saw the waiver as an assignment or alienation to the Estate, thinking that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver transferred the SIP benefits to whoever would be next in line; without a designated contingent beneficiary, the Estate would take them.  The court found support in the applicable Treasury Department regulation that defines \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calienation\xe2\x80\x9d to include</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny direct or indirect arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.401(a)\xe2\x80\x9313(c)(1)(ii) (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee <em>Boggs</em> v. <em>Boggs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/833/index.html">520 U. S. 833</a>, 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (1997) (relying upon the regulation to interpret the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calienation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71056(d)(1)).  The Circuit treated Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98indirect arrangement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whereby the Estate gained an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98interest enforceable against the plan.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 430.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Casting the alienation net this far, though, raises questions that leave one in doubt.  Although it is possible to speak of the waiver as an \xe2\x80\x9carrangement\xe2\x80\x9d having the indirect effect of a transfer to the next possible beneficiary, it would be odd usage to speak of an estate as the transferee of its own decedent\xe2\x80\x99s property, just as it would be to speak of the decedent in his lifetime as his own transferee.  And treating the estate or even the ultimate estate beneficiary as the assignee or transferee would be strange under the terms of the regulation: it would be hard to say the estate or future beneficiary \xe2\x80\x9cacquires\xe2\x80\x9d a right or interest when at the time of the waiver there was no estate and the beneficiary of a future estate might be anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  If there were a contingent beneficiary (or the participant made a subsequent designation) the estate would get no interest; as for an estate beneficiary, the identity could ultimately turn on the law of intestacy applied to facts as yet unknown, or on the contents of the participant\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent will, or simply on the participant\xe2\x80\x99s future exercise of (or failure to invoke) the power to designate a new beneficiary directly under the terms of the plan.  Thus, if such a waiver created an \xe2\x80\x9carrangement\xe2\x80\x9d assigning or transferring anything under the statute, the assignor would be blindfolded, operating, at best, on the fringe of what \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9calienation\xe2\x80\x9d normally suggests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The questionability of this broad reading is confirmed by exceptions to it that are apparent right off the bat.  Take the case of a surviving spouse\xe2\x80\x99s interest in pension benefits, for example.  Depending on the circumstances, a surviving spouse has a right to a survivor\xe2\x80\x99s annuity or to a lump-sum payment on the death of the participant, unless the spouse has waived the right and the participant has eliminated the survivor annuity benefit or designated a different beneficiary.  See <em>Boggs</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 843; 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2).<em> </em> This waiver by a spouse is plainly not barred by the antialienation provision.  Likewise, DuPont concedes that a qualified disclaimer under the Tax Code, which allows a party to refuse an interest in property and thereby eliminate federal tax, would not violate the antialienation provision.

S. 96</a>, 101 (2007).  We explained before that \xc2\xa71056(d)(1) is much like a spendthrift trust provision barring assignment or alienation of a benefit, see <em>Boggs</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 852, and the cognate trust law is highly suggestive here.  Although the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust traditionally lacked the means to transfer his beneficial interest to anyone else, he did have the power to disclaim prior to accepting it, so long as the disclaimer made no attempt to direct the interest to a beneficiary in his stead.  See 2 Restatement (Third) of Trusts \xc2\xa758(1), Comment <em>c, </em>p. 359 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cA designated beneficiary of a spendthrift trust is not required to accept or retain an interest prescribed by the terms of the trust\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

Griswold, Spendthrift Trusts \xc2\xa7524, p. 603 (2d ed. 1947) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe American cases, though not entirely clear, generally take the view that the interest under a spendthrift trust may be disclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Roseberry </em>v. <em>Moncure</em>, 245 Va. 436, 439, 429 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 4, 6 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If a trust is created without notice to the beneficiary or the beneficiary has not accepted the beneficial interest under the trust, he can disclaim\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 1 A.

Common sense and common law both say that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he law certainly is not so absurd as to force a man to take an estate against his will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Townson </em>v. <em>Tickell</em>, 3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 31, 36, 106 Eng.

And, being neither \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its regulation is controlling.  <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461 (1997).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit found \xe2\x80\x9csignificant support\xe2\x80\x9d for its contrary holding in the QDRO subsections, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the marital-dissolution context, the QDRO provisions supply the <em>sole</em> exception to the anti-alienation provision,\xe2\x80\x9d 497 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 430, a point that echoes in DuPont\xe2\x80\x99s argument here.  But the negative implication of the QDRO language is not that simple.  If a QDRO provided a way for a former spouse like Liv merely to waive benefits, this would be powerful evidence that the antialienation provision was meant to deny any effect to a waiver within a divorce decree but not a QDRO, else there would have been no need for the QDRO exception.  But this is not so, and DuPont\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on a false premise.  In fact, a beneficiary seeking only to relinquish her right to benefits cannot do this by a QDRO, for a QDRO by definition requires that it be the \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ion] or recogni[tion of] the existence of an alternate payee\xe2\x80\x99s right to, or assign[ment] to an alternate payee [of] the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I).  There is no QDRO for a simple waiver; there must be some succeeding designation of an alternate payee.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Not being a mechanism for simply renouncing a claim to benefits, then, the QDRO provisions shed no light on whether a beneficiary may waive by a non-QDRO.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the SIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, and accordingly we think that the better view is that her waiver did not constitute an assignment or alienation rendered void under the terms of \xc2\xa71056(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DuPont has three other reasons for saying that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver was barred by ERISA.  They are unavailing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it argues that even if the waiver is not an assignment or alienation barred under the terms of \xc2\xa71056(d)(1), \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(A) still prohibits it, in providing that \xc2\xa71056(d)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order [that is not a QDRO].\xe2\x80\x9d  At the very least, DuPont reasons, Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver included a \xe2\x80\x9crecognition\xe2\x80\x9d of William\xe2\x80\x99s rights with respect to the SIP benefits.  But DuPont overlooks the point that when subsection (d)(3)(A) provides that the bar to assignments or alienations extends to non-QDRO domestic relations orders, it does nothing to expand the scope of prohibited assignment and alienation under subsection (d)(1).  Whether Liv\xe2\x80\x99s action is seen as a\nwaiver or as a domestic relations order that incorpor-\nated a waiver, subsection (d)(1) does not cover it and \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(A) does not independently bar it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, DuPont relies upon \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(H)(iii)(II), providing that if a domestic relations order is not a QDRO, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to DuPont, because the divorce decree was not a QDRO this provision calls for paying benefits as if there had been no order.  But DuPont has wrenched this language out of its setting, reading clause (iii) of subparagraph (H) as if there were no clause (i):</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDuring any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined . . . the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the \xe2\x80\x98segregated amounts\xe2\x80\x99) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(H)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus it is clear that subparagraph (H) speaks of a domestic relations order that distributes certain benefits (the \xe2\x80\x9csegregated amounts\xe2\x80\x9d) to an alternate payee, when the question for the plan administrator is whether the order is effective as a QDRO.  That is the circumstance in which, for want of a QDRO, clause (iii) tells the plan administrator not to pay the alternate, but to distribute the segregated amounts as if there had been no order.  Clause (iii) does not, as DuPont suggests, state a general rule that a non-QDRO domestic relations order is a nullity in any proceeding that would affect the determination of a beneficiary.  And of course clause (iii) says nothing here at all; the divorce decree names no alternate payee, and there are consequently no \xe2\x80\x9csegregated amounts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, DuPont claims that a plan cannot recognize a waiver of benefits in a non-QDRO divorce decree because ERISA preempts \xe2\x80\x9cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cState law\xe2\x80\x9d being defined to include \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cother State action having the effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71144(a), (c)(1).  DuPont says that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver, expressed in a state-court decision and related to an employee benefit plan, is thus preempted.  But recognizing a waiver in a divorce decree would not be giving effect to state law; the argument is that the waiver should be treated as a creature of federal common law, in which case its setting in a state divorce decree would be only happenstance.  A court would merely be applying federal law to a document that might also have independent significance under state law.  See, <em>e.g., Melton </em>v. <em>Melton</em>, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 941, 945\xe2\x80\x93946 (CA7 2003); <em>Clift </em>v. <em>Clift</em>, 210 F.\xc2\xa03d 268, 271\xe2\x80\x93272 (CA5 2000); <em>Lyman Lumber Co</em>. v. <em>Hill</em>, 877 F.\xc2\xa02d 692, 693\xe2\x80\x93694 (CA8 1989).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The waiver\xe2\x80\x99s escape from inevitable nullity under the express terms of the antialienation clause does not, however, control the decision of this case, and the question remains whether the plan administrator was required to honor Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver with the consequence of distributing the SIP balance to the Estate.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We hold that it was not, and that the plan administrator did its statutory ERISA duty by paying the benefits to Liv in conformity with the plan documents.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ERISA requires \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very employee benefit plan [to] be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71102(a)(1), \xe2\x80\x9cspecify[ing] the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71102(b)(4).  The plan administrator is obliged to act \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of [Title I] and [Title IV] of [ERISA],\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>\xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D), and the Act provides no exemption from this duty when it comes time to pay benefits.  On the contrary, \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) (which the Estate happens to invoke against DuPont here) reinforces the directive, with its provision that a participant or beneficiary may bring a cause of action \xe2\x80\x9cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Estate\xe2\x80\x99s claim therefore stands or falls by \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), a straightforward rule of hewing to the directives of the plan documents that lets employers \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98establish a uniform administrative scheme, [with] a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  <em>Egelhoff</em> v. <em>Egelhoff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/141/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/141/index.html">532 U.

The point is that by giving a plan participant a clear set of instructions for making his own instructions clear, ERISA forecloses any justification for enquiries into nice expressions of intent, in favor of the virtues of adhering to an uncomplicated rule: \xe2\x80\x9csimple administration, avoid[ing] double liability, and ensur[ing] that beneficiaries get what\xe2\x80\x99s coming quickly, without the folderol essential under less-certain rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fox Valley &amp; Vicinity Const.

Plan administrators would be forced \xe2\x80\x9cto examine a multitude of external documents that might purport to affect the dispensation of benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Altobelli </em>v.<em> IBM Corp.</em>, 77 F.\xc2\xa03d 78, 82\xe2\x80\x9383 (CA4 1996) (Wilkinson, C. J., dissenting), and be drawn into litigation like this over the meaning and enforceability of purported waivers.  The Estate\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that a plan administrator could resolve these sorts of disputes through interpleader actions merely restates the problem with the Estate\xe2\x80\x99s position: it would destroy a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s ability to look at the plan documents and records conforming to them to get clear distribution instructions, without going into court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Estate of course is right that this guarantee of simplicity is not absolute.  The very enforceability of QDROs means that sometimes a plan administrator must look for the beneficiaries outside plan documents notwithstanding \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D); \xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(J) provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who is an alternate payee under a [QDRO] shall be considered for purposes of any provision of [ERISA] a beneficiary under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this in effect means that a plan administrator who enforces a QDRO must be said to enforce plan documents, not ignore them.  In any case, a QDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given the specific and objective criteria for a domestic relations order that qualifies as a QDRO,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71056(d)(3)(C), (D), requirements that amount to a statutory checklist working to \xe2\x80\x9cspare [an administrator] from litigation-fomenting ambiguities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Wheaton</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa03d 1080, 1084 (CA7 1994).  This is a far cry from asking a plan administrator to figure out whether a claimed federal common law waiver was knowing and voluntary, whether its language addressed the particular benefits at issue, and so forth, on into factually complex and subjective determinations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Altobelli</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 83 (Wilkinson, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]aiver provisions are often sweeping in their terms, leaving their precise effect on plan benefits unclear\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Mohamed </em>v. <em>Kerr</em>, 53 F.\xc2\xa03d 911, 915 (CA8 1995) (making \xe2\x80\x9cfact-driven determination\xe2\x80\x9d that marriage termination agreement constituted a valid waiver under federal common law).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These are good and sufficient reasons for holding the line, just as we have done in cases of state laws that might blur the bright-line requirement to follow plan documents in distributing benefits.  Two recent preemption cases are instructive here.  <em>Boggs</em> v. <em>Boggs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/833/index.html">520 U.

And this case does as well as any other in pointing out the wisdom of protecting the plan documents rule.  Under the terms of the SIP Liv was William\xe2\x80\x99s designated beneficiary.

The plan provided a way to disclaim an interest in the SIP account, but Liv did not purport to follow it.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The plan administrator therefore did exactly what \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D) required: \xe2\x80\x9cthe documents control, and those name [the ex-wife].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McMillan</em> v. <em>Parrott</em>, 913 F.\xc2\xa02d 310, 312 (CA6 1990).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer, as the Estate argues, that William\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary-designation form should not control because it is not one of the \xe2\x80\x9cdocuments and instruments governing the plan\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D) and was not treated as a plan document by the plan administrator.

But the authorities DuPont cites fail to support the proposition that a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise valid disclaimer was invalid at common law because she received consideration.  See <em>Roseberry </em>v. <em>Moncure</em>, 245 Va., at 439, 429 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 6; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bank of Del.</em>, 43 Del.

It is true that the receipt of consideration prevents a beneficiary from making a qualified disclaimer for gift tax purposes, see 26 CFR \xc2\xa725.2518\xe2\x80\x932 (2008), and there is common law authority for the proposition that a renunciation by a devisee is ineffective against existing creditors if \xe2\x80\x9cit is shown that those who would take such property on renunciation had agreed to pay to the devisee something of value in consideration of such renunciation.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 W.

But at common law the receipt of consideration did not necessarily render a disclaimer invalid.  See <em>Commerce Trust Co</em>. v. <em>Fast</em>, 396 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 683, 686\xe2\x80\x93687 (Mo. 1965); <em>Central Nat.

In any event, our point is not that Liv\xe2\x80\x99s waiver was a valid disclaimer at common law: only that reading the terms of 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71056(d)(1) to bar all non-QDRO waivers is unsound in light of background common law principles.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is true that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position regarding the applicability of the antialienation provision to a waiver has fluctuated.  The Labor Department previously took the position that \xe2\x80\x9capplication of such a federal common-law waiver rule to pension plans would conflict with ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s anti-alienation provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Secretary of Labor as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16 in <em>Keen </em>v. <em>Weaver</em>, No. 01\xe2\x80\x930447 (Tex. 2003).

The Labor Department has reconsidered that view and has now taken the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20, n.\xc2\xa06.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe change in interpretation alone presents no separate ground for disregarding the [Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s and the Labor] Department\xe2\x80\x99s present interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Long Island Care at Home, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Coke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/158/index.html">551 U.

Nor does the fact that the interpretation is stated in a legal brief make it unworthy of deference, as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer</em>, 519 U.
