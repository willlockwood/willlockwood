Bush was scheduled to spend the night at a Jacksonville, Oregon, cottage.  Local law enforcement officials permitted a group of Bush supporters and a group of protesters to assemble on opposite sides of a street along the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade route.  When the President made a last-minute decision to have dinner at the outdoor patio area of the Jacksonville Inn\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant before resuming the drive to the cottage, the protesters moved to an area in front of the Inn, which placed them within weapons range of the President.  The supporters remained in their original location, where a two-story building blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio.  At the direction of two Secret Service agents responsible for the President\xe2\x80\x99s security, petitioners here (the agents), local police cleared the area where the protesters had gathered, eventually moving them two blocks away to a street beyond weapons reach of the President.  The agents did not require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the patio, or go through a security screening.  After the President dined, his motorcade passed the supporters, but the protesters, now two blocks from the motorcade\xe2\x80\x99s route, were beyond his sight and hearing. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters sued the agents for damages, alleging that the agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the\n \nFirst Amendment when they moved the protesters away from the Inn but allowed the supporters to remain in their original location.  The District Court denied the agents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds, but on interlocutory appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court held that the protesters had failed to state a\n \nFirst Amendment claim under the plead-ing standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544\n, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662\n.  Because those decisions were rendered after the protesters commenced suit, the Court of Appeals granted leave to amend the complaint.  On remand, the protesters supplemented the complaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to an unwritten Secret Service policy of working with the Bush White House to inhibit the expression of disfavored views at presidential appearances.  The District Court denied the agents\xe2\x80\x99 renewed motion to dismiss.  This time, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the agents\xe2\x80\x99 part could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators.  The Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to qualified immunity because this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent made clear that the Government may not regulate speech based on its content.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The agents are entitled to qualified immunity.

See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 92\n.  The fundamental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to publicize their views \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whenever and however and wherever they please.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Grace,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 171\n.  In deciding whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established\n \nFirst Amendment right, this Court assumes without deciding that Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388\n, which involved alleged\n \nFourth Amendment violations, extends to\n \nFirst Amendment claims, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 675.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages \xe2\x80\x9cunless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was \xe2\x80\x98clearly established\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of the challenged conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive inquiry .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is whether it would [have been] clear to a reasonable officer\xe2\x80\x9d in the agents\xe2\x80\x99 position \xe2\x80\x9cthat [their] conduct was unlawful in the situation [they] confronted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Saucier v. Katz,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194\n.  At the time of the Jacksonville incident, this Court had addressed a constitutional challenge to Secret Service actions only once.  In Hunter v. Bryant,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224\n, the plaintiff challenged the lawfulness of his arrest by two Secret Service agents for writing and delivering a letter about a plot to assassinate President Reagan.  Holding that the agents were shielded by qualified immunity, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9caccommodation for reasonable error .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is nowhere more important than when the specter of Presidential assassination is raised.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 229.  This Court has recognized the overwhelming importance of safeguarding the President in other contexts as well.  See Watts v. United States,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 705\n.  Mindful that officers may be faced with unanticipated security situations, the key question addressed is whether it should have been clear to the agents that the security perimeter they established violated the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0The protesters assert, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the agents violated clearly established federal law by denying them \xe2\x80\x9cequal access to the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  No decision of which the Court is aware, however, would alert Secret Service agents engaged in crowd control that they bear a\n \nFirst Amendment obligation to make sure that groups with conflicting views are at all times in equivalent positions.  Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the situation the agents here confronted, where only the protesters, not the supporters, had a direct line of sight to the patio where the President was dining.  The protesters suggest that the agents could have moved the supporters out of the motorcade\xe2\x80\x99s range as well, but there would have been no security rationale for such a move.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0The protesters allege that, in directing their displacement, the agents acted not to ensure the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety, but to insulate the President from their message.  These allegations are undermined by a map of the area, which shows that, because of the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 location, they posed a potential security risk to the President, while the supporters, because of their location, did not.  The protesters\xe2\x80\x99 counterarguments are unavailing.  They urge that, had the agents\xe2\x80\x99 professed interest in the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety been sincere, the agents would have screened or removed from the premises persons already at the Inn when the President arrived.  But staff, other diners, and Inn guests were on the premises before the agents knew of the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans, and thus could not have anticipated seeing the President, no less causing harm to him.  The agents also could keep a close watch on the relatively small number of people already inside the Inn, surveillance that would have been impossible for the hundreds of people outside the Inn.  A White House manual directs the President\xe2\x80\x99s advance team to \xe2\x80\x9cwork with the Secret Service .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to designate a protest area .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.\xe2\x80\x9d  The manual guides the conduct of the political advance team, not the Secret Service, whose own written guides explicitly prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cagents from discriminating between anti-government and pro-government demonstrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even assuming, as the protesters maintain, that other agents, at other times and places, have assisted in shielding the President from political speech, this case is scarcely one in which the agents lacked a valid security reason for their ac-tions.  Moreover, because individual government officials \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be held liable\xe2\x80\x9d in a Bivens suit \xe2\x80\x9cunless they themselves acted [unconstitutionally],\xe2\x80\x9d Iqbal, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 683, this Court declines to infer from alleged instances of misconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten Secret Service policy to suppress disfavored expression, and then attribute that supposed policy to all field-level operatives.

The episode in suit occurred in Jacksonville, Oregon, on the evening of October 14, 2004.  President George W. Bush, campaigning in the area for a second term, was scheduled to spend the evening at a cottage in Jacksonville.  With permission from local law enforcement officials, two groups assembled on opposite sides of the street on which the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade was to travel to reach the cottage.  One group supported the President, the other opposed him.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The President made a last-minute decision to stop in town for dinner before completing the drive to the cottage.  His motorcade therefore turned from the planned route and proceeded to the outdoor patio dining area of the Jacksonville Inn\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant.  Learning of the route change, the protesters moved down the sidewalk to the area in front of the Inn.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters remained across the street and about a half block away from the Inn.  At the direction of the Secret Service agents, state and local police cleared the block on which the Inn was located and moved the protesters some two blocks away to a street beyond handgun or explosive reach of the President.  The move placed the protesters a block farther away from the Inn than the supporters.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Officials are sheltered from suit, under a doctrine known as qualified immunity, when their conduct \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not violate clearly established .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d a reasonable official, similarly situated, would have comprehended.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800,\n818 (1982)\n.  The\n \nFirst Amendment, our precedent makes plain, disfavors viewpoint-based discrimination.  See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819,\n828 (1995)\n.  But safeguarding the President is also of overwhelming importance in our constitutional system.  See Watts v. United States,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 705,\n707 (1969)\n (per curiam).  Faced with the President\xe2\x80\x99s sudden decision to stop for dinner, the Secret Service agents had to cope with a security situation not earlier anticipated.  No decision of this Court so much as hinted that their on-the-spot action was unlawful because they failed to keep the protesters and supporters, throughout the episode, equidistant from the President.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled otherwise.  It found dispositive of the agents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss \xe2\x80\x9cthe considerable disparity in the distance each group was allowed to stand from the Presiden[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 711 F.\xc2\xa03d 941, 946 (2013).  Because no \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d so controlled the agents\xe2\x80\x99 response to the motorcade\xe2\x80\x99s detour, we reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On October 14, 2004, after a nearby campaign appear-ance, President George W. Bush was scheduled to spend the night at a cottage in Jacksonville, Oregon.  Anticipating the visit, a group of individuals, including respondents (the protesters), organized a demonstration to express their opposition to the President and his policies.  At around 6:00 p.m. on the evening the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade was expected to pass through the town, between 200 and 300 protesters gathered in Jacksonville, on California Street between Third and Fourth Streets.  See infra, at 4 (map depicting the relevant area in Jacksonville).  The gathering had been precleared with local law enforcement authorities.  On the opposite side of Third Street, a similarly sized group of individuals (the supporters) assembled to show their support for the President.  If, as planned, the motorcade had traveled down Third Street to reach the cottage, with no stops along the way, the protesters and supporters would have had equal access to the President throughout in delivering their respective messages.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This situation was unsettled when President Bush made a spur-of-the-moment decision to stop for dinner at the Jacksonville Inn before proceeding to the cottage.  The Inn stands on the north side of California Street, on the block where the protesters had assembled.  Learning of the President\xe2\x80\x99s change in plans, the protesters moved along the block to face the Inn.  The respective positions of the protesters and supporters at the time the President arrived at the Inn are shown on the following map, which the protesters attached as an exhibit to their complaint:[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As the map indicates, the protesters massed on the sidewalk directly in front of the Inn, while the supporters remained assembled on the block west of Third Street, some distance from the Inn.  The map also shows an alley running along the east side of the Inn (the California Street alley) leading to an outdoor patio used by the Inn\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant as a dining area.  A six-foot high wooden fence surrounded the patio.  At the location where the President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters gathered, a large two-story building, the U. S. Hotel, extended north around the corner of California and Third Streets.  That structure blocked sight of, and weapons access to, the patio from points on California Street west of the Inn.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners are two Secret Service agents (the agents) responsible for the President\xe2\x80\x99s security during the Jacksonville visit.  Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on the evening in question, the agents enlisted the aid of local police officers to secure the area for the President\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected stop at the Inn.  Following the agents\xe2\x80\x99 instructions, the local officers first cleared the alley running from Third Street to the patio (the Third Street alley), which the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade would use to access the Inn.  The officers then cleared Third Street north of California Street, as well as the California Street alley.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At around 7:15 p.m., the President arrived at the Inn.  As the motorcade entered the Third Street alley, both sets of demonstrators were equally within the President\xe2\x80\x99s sight and hearing.  When the President reached the outdoor patio dining area, the protesters stood on the sidewalk directly in front of the California Street alley, exhibiting signs and chanting slogans critical of the President and his policies.  In view of the short distance between California Street and the patio, the protesters no longer contest that they were then within weapons range of the President.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\xe2\x80\x934, 35, 39\xe2\x80\x9340; Brief for Petitioners 44.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Approximately 15 minutes later, the agents directed the officers to clear the protesters from the block in front of the Inn and move them to the east side of Fourth Street.  From their new location, the protesters were roughly the same distance from the President as the supporters.  But unlike the supporters, whose sight and access were obstructed by the U. S. Hotel, only a parking lot separated the protesters from the patio.  The protesters thus remained within weapons range of, and had a direct line of sight to, the President\xe2\x80\x99s location.  This sight line is illustrated by the broken arrow marked on the map below.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After another 15 minutes passed, the agents directed the officers again to move the protesters, this time one block farther away from the Inn, to the east side of Fifth Street.  The relocation was necessary, the agents told the local officers, to ensure that no demonstrator would be \xe2\x80\x9cwithin handgun or explosive range of the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 177a.  The agents, however, did not require the guests already inside the Inn to leave, stay clear of the patio, or go through any security screening.  The supporters at all times retained their original location on the west side of Third Street.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After the President dined, the motorcade left the Inn by traveling south on Third Street toward the cottage.  On its way, the motorcade passed the President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters.  The protesters remained on Fifth Street, two blocks away from the motorcade\xe2\x80\x99s route, thus beyond the President\xe2\x80\x99s sight and hearing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters sued the agents for damages in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the District of Oregon.  The agents\xe2\x80\x99 actions, the complaint asserted, violated the protesters\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFirst Amendment rights by the manner in which the agents established a security perimeter around the President during his unscheduled stop for dinner.  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388 (1971)\n (recognizing claim for damages against federal agents for violations of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment rights).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Specifically, the protesters alleged that the agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination when they moved the protesters away from the Inn, while allowing the supporters to remain in their original location.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The agents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 allegations were insufficient to state a claim for violation of the\n \nFirst Amendment.  The agents further maintained that they were sheltered by qualified immunity because the constitutional right alleged by the protesters was not clearly established.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court denied the motion, see Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 2007 WL 2915608, *1, 20 (D Ore., Oct. 7, 2007), but on interlocutory appeal,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  See Moss v. United States Secret Serv., 572 F.\xc2\xa03d 962 (2009).  The facts alleged in the complaint, the Court of Appeals held, were insufficient to state a\n \nFirst Amendment claim under the pleading standards prescribed in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544 (2007)\n, and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662 (2009)\n.  572 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 974\xe2\x80\x93975.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Because Twombly and Iqbal were decided after the protesters filed their complaint, however, the Ninth Circuit instructed the District Court to grant the protesters leave to amend.  572 F. 3d, at 972.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On remand, the protesters supplemented their complaint with allegations that the agents acted pursuant to an \xe2\x80\x9cactual but unwritten\xe2\x80\x9d Secret Service policy of \xe2\x80\x9cwork[ing] with the White House under President Bush to eliminate dissent and protest from presidential appearances.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.  Relying on published media reports, the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 amended complaint cited several instances in which other Secret Service agents allegedly engaged in conduct designed to suppress expression critical of President Bush at his public appearances.  The amended complaint also included an excerpt from a White House manual instructing the President\xe2\x80\x99s advance team to \xe2\x80\x9cwork with the Secret Service and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed; preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 219a.

Viewpoint-driven conduct, the Court of Appeals maintained, could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for \xe2\x80\x9cthe differential treatment\xe2\x80\x9d accorded the two groups of demonstrators.  See id., at 946.  The Court of Appeals further held that the agents were not entitled to qualified immunity because this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] clear . . . \xe2\x80\x98that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 963 (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 828).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The agents petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc, urging that the panel erred in finding the alleged constitutional violation clearly established.  Over the dissent of eight judges, the Ninth Circuit denied the en banc petition.  See 711 F. 3d, at 947 (O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  We granted certiorari.  571 U.

See, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 92,\n96 (1972)\n.  It is equally plain that the fundamental right to speak secured by the\n \nFirst Amendment does not leave people at liberty to pub-licize their views \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whenever and however and wher-ever they please.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

Our decision in this case starts from those premises.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The particular question before us is whether the protesters have alleged violation of a clearly established\n \nFirst Amendment right based on the agents\xe2\x80\x99 decision to order the protesters moved from their original location in front of the Inn, first to the block just east of the Inn, and then another block farther.  We note, initially, an antecedent issue: Does the\n \nFirst Amendment give rise to an implied right of action for damages against federal officers who violate that Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantees?  In Bivens, cited supra, at 8, we recognized an implied right of action against federal officers for violations of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Thereafter, we have several times assumed without deciding that Bivens extends to\n \nFirst Amendment claims.  See, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 675.  We do so again in this case.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (counsel for petitioners observed that the implication of a right to sue derived from the\n \nFirst Amendment itself was an issue \xe2\x80\x9cnot preserved below\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cnot presented\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages \xe2\x80\x9cunless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was \xe2\x80\x98clearly established\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of the challenged conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3).

The Ninth Circuit did not deny that security concerns justified \xe2\x80\x9cmov[ing] the anti-Bush pro-testers somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But, the court determined, no reason was shown for \xe2\x80\x9cthe considerable disparity in the distance each group was allowed to stand from the Presidential party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The agents thus offended the\n \nFirst Amendment, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, because their directions to the local officers placed the protesters at a \xe2\x80\x9ccomparativ[e] disadvantag[e] in expressing their views\xe2\x80\x9d to the President.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        No decision of which we are aware, however, would alert Secret Service agents engaged in crowd control that they bear a\n \nFirst Amendment obligation \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that groups with different viewpoints are at comparable locations at all times.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 952 (O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the situation the agents confronted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Recall that at the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 location on the north side of California Street, see supra, at 4, they faced an alley giving them a direct line of sight to the outdoor patio where the President stopped to dine.  The first move, to the corner of Fourth and California Streets, proved no solution, for there, only a parking lot stood between the protesters and the patio.  True, at both locations, a six-foot wooden fence and an unspecified number of local police officers impeded access to the President.  Even so, 200 to 300 protesters were within weapons range, and had a largely unobstructed view, of the President\xe2\x80\x99s location.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for respondents acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cin hindsight, you could .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. conclude\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cproximity [of the protesters to the President] alone .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is enough to create a security [risk]\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Eggen &amp; Fletcher, FBI:  Grenade Was a Threat to Bush, Washington Post, May 19, 2005, p.

See App. Pet. for Cert. 178a.  As earlier explained, however, see supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, there would have been no security rationale for such a move.  In contrast to the open alley and parking lot on the east side of the Inn, to the west of the Inn where the supporters stood, a large, two-story building blocked sight of, or weapons access to, the patio the agents endeavored to secure.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  No clearly established law, we agree, required the Secret Service \xe2\x80\x9cto interfere with even more speech than security concerns would require in an attempt to keep opposing groups at roughly equal distances from the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 32.  And surely no such law required the agents to attempt to maintain equal dis-tances by \xe2\x80\x9cprevail[ing] upon the President not to dine at the Inn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oral Arg. Audio in No. 10\xe2\x80\x9336152 (CA9) 42:22 to 43:36 (argument by protesters\xe2\x80\x99 counsel), available at http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view.php?pk_id=0000008129.(as visited May 19, 2014, and in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (argument tendered by protesters\xe2\x80\x99 counsel).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters allege that, when the agents directed their displacement, the agents acted not to ensure the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety from handguns or explosive devices.  Instead, the protesters urge, the agents had them moved solely to insulate the President from their message, thereby giving the President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters greater visibility and audibility.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  The Ninth Circuit found sufficient the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that the agents \xe2\x80\x9cacted with the sole intent to discriminate against [the protesters] because of their viewpoint\xe2\x80\x9d.  711 F. 3d, at 964.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9callow[ed] the protestors\xe2\x80\x99 claim of viewpoint discrimination to proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 962.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It may be, the agents acknowledged, that clearly established law proscribed the Secret Service from disadvantaging one group of speakers in comparison to another if the agents had \xe2\x80\x9cno objectively reasonable security rationale\xe2\x80\x9d for their conduct, but acted solely to inhibit the expression of disfavored views.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329; Brief for Petitioners 52 (entitlement to relief might have been established if, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pro-Bush group had .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. been allowed to move into the nearer location that the anti-Bush had vacated\xe2\x80\x9d).  We agree with the agents, however, that the map itself, reproduced supra, at 4, undermines the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 allegations of viewpoint discrimination as the sole reason for the agents\xe2\x80\x99 directions.  The map corroborates that, because of their location, the protesters posed a potential security risk to the President, while the supporters, because of their location, did not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters make three arguments to shore up their charge that the agents\xe2\x80\x99 asserted security concerns are disingenuous.  First, the protesters urge that, had the agents\xe2\x80\x99 professed interest in the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety been sincere, the agents would have directed all persons pres-ent at the Inn to be screened or removed from the prem-ises.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  But staff, other diners, and Inn guests were there even before the agents themselves knew that the President would dine at the Inn.  See Brief for Petitioners 47.  Those already at the Inn \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have had any expectation that they would see the President that evening or any opportunity to premeditate a plan to cause him harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 16.  The Secret Service, moreover, could take measures to ensure that the relatively small number of people already inside the Inn were kept under close watch; no similar surveillance would have been possible for 200 to 300 people congregating in front of the Inn.  See ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters also point to a White House manual, which states that the President\xe2\x80\x99s advance team should \xe2\x80\x9cwork with the Secret Service .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to designate a protest area .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a.  This manual guides the conduct of the President\xe2\x80\x99s political advance team.  See id., at 220a (distinguishing between the political role of the advance team and the security mission of the Secret Service).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]   As the complaint acknowledges, the Secret Service has its own \xe2\x80\x9cwritten guidelines, directives, instructions and rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 184a.  Those guides explicitly \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit Secret Service agents from discriminating between anti-government and pro-government demonstrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The protesters maintain that the Secret Service does not adhere to its own written guides.  They recite several instances in which Secret Service agents allegedly engaged in viewpoint discrimination.  See id., at 189a\xe2\x80\x93194a.  Even accepting as true the submission that Secret Service agents, at times, have assisted in shielding the President from political speech, this case is scarcely one in which the agents acted \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a valid security reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 40.  We emphasize, again, that the protesters were at least as close to the President as were the supporters when the motorcade arrived at the Jacksonville Inn.  See supra, at 5.  And as the map attached to the complaint shows, see supra, at 4, when the President reached the patio to dine, the protesters, but not the supporters, were within weapons range of his location.  See supra, at 14.  Given that situation, the protesters cannot plausibly urge that the agents \xe2\x80\x9chad no valid security reason to request or order the[ir] eviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We note, moreover, that individual government officials \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be held liable\xe2\x80\x9d in a Bivens suit \xe2\x80\x9cunless they themselves acted [unconstitutionally].\xe2\x80\x9d  Iqbal, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 683.  We therefore decline to infer from alleged instances of misconduct on the part of particular agents an unwritten policy of the Secret Service to suppress disfavored expression, and then to attribute that supposed policy to all field-level operatives.
