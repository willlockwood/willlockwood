JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The issue here is whether a suit against an employer by employees asserting breach of a collective bargaining contract was properly dismissed where the accompanying complaint against the union for breach of duty of fair representation has withstood the union\'s motion for summary judgment and remains to be tried.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] who were formerly employed as truck drivers by respondent Anchor Motor Freight, Inc. (Anchor), were discharged on June 5, 1967.  The applicable collective bargaining contract forbade discharges without just cause.  The company charged dishonesty.  The practice at Anchor was to reimburse drivers for money spent for lodging while the drivers were on the road overnight.  Anchor\'s assertion was that petitioners had sought reimbursement for motel expenses in excess of the actual charges sustained by them.  At a meeting between the company and the union, Local 377, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Union), which was also attended by petitioners, Anchor presented motel receipts previously submitted by petitioners which were in excess of the charges shown on the motel\'s registration cards; a notarized statement of the motel clerk asserting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 424 U. S. 557</a></p><p> the accuracy of the registration cards; and an affidavit of the motel owner affirming that the registration cards were accurate and that inflated receipts had been furnished petitioners.  The Union claimed petitioners were innocent, and opposed the discharges.  It was then agreed that the matter would be presented to the joint arbitration committee for the area, to which the collective bargaining contract permitted either party to submit an unresolved grievance. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Pending this hearing, petitioners were reinstated.  Their suggestion that the motel be investigated was answered by the Union representatives\' assurances that "there was nothing to worry about," and that they need not hire their own attorney.</p>\n<p>A hearing before the joint area committee was held on July 26, 1967.  Anchor presented its case.  Both the Union and petitioners were afforded an opportunity to present their case and to be heard.  Petitioners denied their dishonesty, but neither they nor the Union presented any other evidence contradicting the documents presented by the company.  The committee sustained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 424 U. S. 558</a></p><p> the discharges.  Petitioners then retained an attorney and sought rehearing based on a statement by the motel owner that he had no personal knowledge of the events, but that the discrepancy between the receipts and the registration cards could have been attributable to the motel clerk\'s recording on the cards less than was actually paid and retaining for himself the difference between the amount receipted and the amount recorded.  The committee, after hearing, unanimously denied rehearing "because there was no new evidence presented which would justify a reopening of this case."  App. 212.</p>\n<p>There were later indications that the motel clerk was, in fact, the culprit, and the present suit was filed in June, 1969, against Anchor, the Union, and its International.  The complaint alleged that the charges of dishonesty made against petitioners by Anchor were false, that there was no just cause for discharge, and that the discharges had been in breach of contract.  It was also asserted that the falsity of the charges could have been discovered with a minimum of investigation, that the Union had made no effort to ascertain the truth of the charges, and that the Union had violated its duty of fair representation by arbitrarily and in bad faith depriving petitioners of their employment and permitting their discharge without sufficient proof.</p>\n<p>The Union denied the charges and relied on the decision of the joint area committee.  Anchor asserted that petitioners had been properly discharged for just cause.  It also defended on the ground that petitioners, diligently and in good faith represented by the Union, had unsuccessfully resorted to the grievance and arbitration machinery provided by the contract, and that the adverse decision of the joint arbitration committee was binding upon the Union and petitioners under the contractual provision declaring that</p>\n<p>"[a] decision by a majority of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 424 U. S. 559</a></p><p> Panel of any of the Committees shall be final and binding on all parties, including the employee and/or employees affected. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]"</p>\n<p>Discovery followed, including a deposition of the motel clerk revealing that he had falsified the records and that it was he who had pocketed the difference between the sums shown on the receipts and the registration cards.  Motions for summary judgment filed by Anchor and the Unions were granted by the District Court on the ground that the decision of the arbitration committee was final and binding on the employees and "for failure to show facts comprising bad faith, arbitrariness or perfunctoriness on the part of the Unions."  72 CCH Lab.Cas. \xef\xbf\xbd 13,987, p. 28, 131 (ND Ohio 1973).  Although indicating that the acts of the Union</p>\n<p>"may not meet professional standards of competency, and while it might have been advisable for the Union to further investigate the charges . . . ,"</p>\n<p>the District Court concluded that the facts demonstrated, at most, bad judgment on the part of the Union, which was insufficient to prove a breach of duty or make out a <em>prima facie</em> case against it.  <em>Id.</em> at 28, 132.</p>\n<p>After reviewing the allegations and the record before it, the Court of Appeals concluded that there were sufficient facts from which bad faith or arbitrary conduct on the part of the local Union could be inferred by the trier of fact, and that petitioners should have been afforded an opportunity to prove their charges. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 424 U. S. 560</a></p><p> this extent, the judgment of the District Court was reversed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of Anchor and the International.  Saying that petitioners wanted to relitigate their discharges because of the recantation of the motel clerk, the Court of Appeals, quoting from its prior opinion in <em>Balowski v. International Union,</em> 372 F.2d 829 (CA6 1987), [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] concluded that the finality provision of collective bargaining contracts must be observed because there was "[n]o evidence of any misconduct on the part of the employer . . . " and wholly insufficient evidence of any conspiracy between the Union and Anchor.  506 F.2d at 1157, 1158. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 424 U. S. 561</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is this. judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to Anchor that is now before us on our limited grant of the employees\' petition for writ of certiorari.  421 U.S. 928 (1975). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  We reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185, provides for suits in the district courts for violation of collective bargaining contracts between labor organizations and employers without regard to the amount in controversy. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This provision reflects the interest of Congress in promoting "a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements. . . ."  S.Rep.

The strong policy favoring judicial enforcement of collective bargaining contracts was sufficiently powerful to sustain the jurisdiction of the district courts over enforcement suits even though the conduct involved was arguably or would amount to an unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.  <em>Smith v.

Section 301 contemplates suits by and against individual employees, as well as between unions and employers; and, contrary to earlier indications, \xc2\xa7 301 suits encompass those seeking to vindicate "uniquely personal" rights of employees such as wages, hours, overtime pay, and wrongful discharge.  <em>Smith v.

Petitioners\' present suit against the employer was for wrongful discharge, and is the kind of case Congress provided for in \xc2\xa7 301.</p>\n<p>Collective bargaining contracts, however, generally contain procedures for the settlement of disputes through mutual discussion and arbitration.  These provisions are among those which are to be enforced under \xc2\xa7 301.  Furthermore, Congress has specified in \xc2\xa7 203(d), 61 Stat. 154, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 173(d), that "[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes. . . ."  This congressional policy</p>\n<p>"can be effectuated only if the means chosen by the parties for settlement of their differences under a collective bargaining agreement is given full play."</p>\n<p><em>Steelworkers v.

Maddox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/650/case.html">379 U. S. 650</a></span> (1965).  <em>Maddox</em> nevertheless distinguished the situation where</p>\n<p>"the union refuses to press or only perfunctorily presses the individual\'s claim. . . .  <em>See Humphrey v.

The federal labor laws, in seeking to strengthen the bargaining position of the average worker in an industrial economy, provided for the selection of collective bargaining agents with wide authority to negotiate and conclude collective bargaining agreements on behalf of all employees in appropriate units, as well as to be the employee\'s agent in the enforcement and administration of the contract.  Wages, hours, working conditions, seniority, and job security therefore became the business of certified or recognized bargaining agents, as did the contractual procedures for the processing and settling of grievances, including those with respect to discharge.</p>\n<p>Necessarily, "[a] wide range of reasonableness must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 424 U.

They sought damages and an injunction to prevent implementation of the decision of the joint arbitration committee.  The union was charged with dishonest and bad faith representation of the employees before the joint committee.  The unions and the defendant employees asserted the finality of the joint committee\'s decision, if not as a final resolution of a dispute in the administration of a contract, as a bargained-for accommodation between the two parties.

S. 187</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even though, under <em>Vaca,</em> the employer may not insist on exhaustion of grievance procedures when the union has breached its representation duty, it is urged that, when the procedures have been followed and a decision favorable to the employer announced, the employer must be protected from relitigation by the express contractual provision declaring a decision to be final and binding.  We disagree.  The union\'s breach of duty relieves the employee of an express or implied requirement that disputes be settled through contractual grievance procedures; if it seriously undermines the integrity of the arbitral process, the union\'s breach also removes the bar of the finality provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p>It is true that <em>Vaca</em> dealt with a refusal by the union </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 424 U. S. 568</a></p><p> to process a grievance.  It is also true that, where the union actually utilizes the grievance and arbitration procedures on behalf of the employee, the focus is no longer on the reasons for the union\'s failure to act, but on whether, contrary to the arbitrator\'s decision, the employer breached the contract, and whether there is substantial reason to believe that a union breach of duty contributed to the erroneous outcome of the contractual proceedings.  But the judicial remedy in <em>Humphrey v. Moore</em> was sought after the adverse decision of the joint arbitration committee.  Our conclusion in that case was not that the committee\'s decision was unreviewable.  On the contrary, we proceeded on the basis that it was reviewable and vulnerable if tainted by breach of duty on the part of the union, even though the employer had not conspired with the union.  The joint committee\'s decision was held binding on the complaining employees only after we determined that the union had not been guilty of malfeasance and that its conduct was within the range of acceptable performance by a collective bargaining agent, a wholly unnecessary determination if the union\'s conduct was irrelevant to the finality of the arbitral process. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Vaca,</em> "we accept[ed] the proposition that a union </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 424 U. S. 569</a></p><p> may not arbitrarily ignore a meritorious grievance or process it in a perfunctory fashion," 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#191">386 U. S. 191</a></span>, and our ruling that the union had not breached its duty of fair representation in not pressing the employee\'s case to the last step of the grievance process stemmed from our evaluation of the manner in which the union had handled the grievance in its earlier stages.  Although</p>\n<p>"the Union might well have breached its duty had it ignored [the employee\'s] complaint or had it processed the grievance in a perfunctory manner,"</p>\n<p>"the Union conclude[d] both that arbitration would be fruitless and that the grievance should be dismissed" only after it had</p>\n<p>"processed the grievance into the fourth step, attempted to gather sufficient evidence to prove [the employee\'s] case, attempted to secure for [him] less vigorous work at the plant, and joined in the employer\'s efforts to have [him] rehabilitated."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#194">386 U. S. 194</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Anchor would have it that petitioners are foreclosed from judicial relief unless some blameworthy conduct on its part dissentitles it to rely on the finality rule.  But it was Anchor that originated the discharges for dishonesty.  If those charges were in error, Anchor has surely played its part in precipitating this dispute.  Of course, both courts below held there were no facts suggesting that Anchor either knowingly or negligently relied on false evidence.  As far as the record reveals, it also prevailed before the joint committee after presenting its case in accordance with what were ostensibly wholly fair procedures.  Nevertheless there remains the question whether the contractual protection against relitigating an arbitral decision binds employees who assert that the process has fundamentally malfunctioned by reason of the bad-faith performance of the union, their statutorily imposed collective bargaining agent. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 424 U. S. 570</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Under the rule announced by the Court of Appeals, unless the employer is implicated in the Union\'s malfeasance or has otherwise caused the arbitral process to err, petitioners would have no remedy against Anchor even though they are successful in proving the Union\'s bad faith, the falsity of the charges against them, and the breach of contract by Anchor by discharging without cause.  This rule would apparently govern even in circumstances where it is shown that a union has manufactured the evidence and knows from the start that it is false; or even if, unbeknownst to the employer, the union has corrupted the arbitrator to the detriment of disfavored union members.  As is the case where there has been a failure to exhaust, however, we cannot believe that Congress intended to foreclose the employee from his \xc2\xa7 301 remedy otherwise available against the employer if the contractual processes have been seriously flawed by the union\'s breach of its duty to represent employees honestly and in good faith and without invidious discrimination or arbitrary conduct.</p>\n<p>It is urged that the reversal of the Court of Appeals will undermine not only the finality rule, but the entire collective bargaining process.  Employers, it is said, will be far less willing to give up their untrammeled right to discharge without cause and to agree to private settlement procedures.  But the burden on employees will remain a substantial one, far too heavy in the opinion of some. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  To prevail against either the company or the Union, petitioners must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract, but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="571">Page 424 U. S. 571</a></p><p> Union.  As the District Court indicated, this involves more than demonstrating mere errors in judgment.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are not entitled to relitigate their discharge merely because they offer newly discovered evidence that the charges against them were false and that, in fact, they were fired without cause.  The grievance processes cannot be expected to be error-free.  The finality provision has sufficient force to surmount occasional instances of mistake.  But it is quite another matter to suggest that erroneous arbitration decisions must stand even though the employee\'s representation by the union has been dishonest, in bad faith, or discriminatory, for, in that event, error and injustice of the grossest sort would multiply.  The contractual system would then cease to qualify as an adequate mechanism to secure individual redress for damaging failure of the employer to abide by the contract.  Congress has put its blessing on private dispute settlement arrangements provided in collective agreements, but it was anticipated, we are sure, that the contractual machinery would operate within some minimum levels of integrity.  In our view, enforcement of the finality provision where the arbitrator has erred is conditioned upon the union\'s having satisfied its statutory duty fairly to represent the employee in connection with the arbitration proceedings.  Wrongfully discharged employees would be left without jobs and without a fair opportunity to secure an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p>Except for this case, the Courts of Appeals have arrived at similar conclusions. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As the Court of Appeals for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 424 U. S. 572</a></p><p> Ninth Circuit put it in <em>Margetta v. Pam Pam Corp,</em> 501 F.2d 179, 180 (1974):</p>\n<p>"To us, it makes little difference whether the union subverts the arbitration process by refusing to proceed as in <em>Vaca</em> or follows the arbitration trail to the end, but, in so doing, subverts the arbitration process by failing to fairly represent the employee.  In neither case does the employee receive fair representation."</p>\n<p>Petitioners, if they prove an erroneous discharge and the Union\'s breach of duty tainting the decision of the joint committee, are entitled to an appropriate remedy against the employer as well as the Union.  It was error to affirm the District Court\'s final dismissal of petitioners\' action against Anchor.  To this extent, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

If the dispute remained unresolved, either party had the right to present the case for decision to the appropriate joint area arbitration committee.  These committees are organized on a geographical area basis, and hear grievances in panels made up of an equal number of representatives of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement.  Cases that deadlocked before the joint area committee could be taken to a panel of the national joint arbitration committee, composed, like the area committee panels, of an equal number of representatives of the parties to the agreement.

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that proof of breach of the Union\'s duty of fair representation will remove the bar of finality from the arbitral decision that Anchor did not wrongfully discharge the petitioners.  <em>See Vaca v.

To hold an employer liable for back wages for the period during which he rightfully refuses to rehire discharged employees would be to charge him with a contractual violation on the basis of conduct precisely in accord with the dictates of the collective agreement.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Petitioners seek $1 million damages from their employer and their union on the grounds that they were wrongfully discharged from their jobs.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, finding that the issues had been finally decided as to respondent Anchor Motor by the arbitration committee and that petitioners had failed "to show facts comprising bad faith, arbitrariness or perfunctoriness on the part of the Unions."  The Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment as to the local Union, holding that the issue of bad faith should not have been summarily decided.  However, as to respondent Anchor Motor, the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, where, as here, the collective bargaining agreement provided that arbitration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 424 U. S. 574</a></p><p> would be final and binding, the decision of the arbitrator would not be upset</p>\n<p>"absent a showing of fraud, misrepresentation, bad faith, dishonesty of purpose, or such gross mistake or inaction as to imply bad faith on the part of the Union or the employer."</p>\n<p>506 F.2d 1153, 1157 (1974).  This Court, assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the Union breached its duty of fair representation for the reasons set forth in the opinion, reverses as to Anchor Motor, holding that the Union\'s breach of its duty to its members voided an otherwise valid arbitration decision in favor of the company.  I find this result to be anomalous, and contrary to the longstanding policy of this Court favoring the finality of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p>In <em>Vaca v. Sipes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html">386 U. S. 171</a></span> (1967), this Court held that, where the union has prevented the employee from taking his grievance to arbitration, as provided in the collective bargaining agreement, he may then turn to the courts for relief.  This decision bolstered the consistent policy of this Court of encouraging the parties to settle their differences according to the terms of their collective bargaining agreement.  <em>Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/564/case.html">363 U.

By subjecting the employer to a damages suit due to the union\'s failure to utilize the arbitration process on behalf of the employees, the <em>Vaca</em> decision put pressure on both employers and unions to make full use of the contractual provisions for settling disputes by arbitration.</p>\n<p>The decision in this case will have the exact opposite result.  Here the Court has cast aside the policy of finality of arbitration decisions and established a new policy of encouraging challenges to arbitration decrees by the losing party on the ground that he was not properly represented.</p>\n<p>The majority cites <em>Margetta v. Pam Pam Corp.,</em> 501 F.2d 179, 180 (CA9 1974), for the proposition that</p>\n<p>"it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 424 U.

S. 572</a></span>.  To the contrary, I believe that the existence of a final arbitration decision is the crucial difference between this case and <em>Vaca.</em>  The duty of "fair representation" discussed in <em>Vaca</em> was the duty of the union to put the case to a fair and neutral arbitrator, a step which the employee could not take by himself.  386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#185">386 U. S. 185</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Here, the case was presented to a concededly fair and neutral arbitrator, but the claim is that that arbitration decision should be vacated because the employee did not receive "fair representation" from the Union in the sense of representation by counsel at a trial.  Obviously this stretches <em>Vaca</em> far beyond its original meaning, and adopts the novel notion that one may vacate an otherwise valid arbitration award because his "counsel" was ineffective.</p>\n<p>As noted, such a principle violates this Court\'s policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards.  It also has no basis in the statutory provisions respecting arbitration.  Section 12 of the Uniform Arbitration Act, which is in use in many States, sets forth the grounds for vacating an award.  These include awards having been procured by corruption or fraud, and arbitrators\' exceeding their powers or exhibiting evident partiality.  The federal statute governing arbitration, 9 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1-14, provides similarly narrow grounds for vacating an award.  \xc2\xa7 10.  Nowhere is any provision made for vacation of an award due to ineffective presentation of the case by a party\'s attorney or representative.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision is particularly vexing on the facts of this case.  Petitioners had at their own disposal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 424 U. S. 576</a></p><p> all of the information necessary to present their case.  If they had felt that the Union had not brought this information fully to the attention of the arbitration committee, or that further investigation was necessary, they could have so informed the committee.  There is no indication that they did so.  Rather, they allowed, without protest, the arbitration to proceed to a decision, and, when that decision was adverse, they brought suit against the company and the Union.</p>\n<p>Now, the employer, which concededly acted in good faith throughout these proceedings, is to be subjected to a damages suit because of the Union\'s alleged misconduct.  In view of the fact that petitioners have an action for damages against the Union, <em>see Czosek v. O\'Mara,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/25/case.html">397 U. S. 25</a></span> (1970), this additional remedy against the employer seems both undesirable and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
