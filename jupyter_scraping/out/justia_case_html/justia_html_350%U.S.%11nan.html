JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>After serving with the United States Air Force in Korea, Robert W. Toth was honorably discharged.  He returned to his home in Pittsburgh and went o work in a steel plant.  Five months later, he was arrested by military authorities on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder while an airman in Korea. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  At the time of arrest, he had no relationship of any kind with the military.  He was taken to Korea to stand trial before a court-martial under authority of a 1950 Act of Congress. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals sustained the Act, rejecting the contention that civilian ex-servicemen like Toth could not constitutionally be subjected to trial by court-martial.  94 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 215 F.2d 22.  We granted certiorari to pass upon this important constitutional question.  348 U.S. 809. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1950 Act cannot be sustained on the constitutional power of Congress "To raise and support Armies," "To declare War," or to punish "Offences against the Law of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 350 U. S. 14</a></p><p> Nations." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And this assertion of military authority over civilians cannot rest on the President\'s power as commander-in-chief, or on any theory of martial law.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html">Ex parte Milligan,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 2,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#124">71 U. S. 124</a></span>-127.  The Government\'s contention is that the Act is a valid exercise of the power granted Congress in Article I of the Constitution "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," as supplemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court has held that the Article I clause just quoted authorizes Congress to subject persons actually in the armed service to trial by court-martial for military and naval offenses. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Later it was held that court-martial jurisdiction could be exerted over a dishonorably discharged soldier then a military prisoner serving a sentence imposed by a prior court-martial. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It has never been intimated by this Court, however, that Article I military jurisdiction could be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who had severed all relationship with the military and its institutions. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  To allow this extension of military </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 350 U. S. 15</a></p><p> authority would require an extremely broad construction of the language used in the constitutional provision relied on.  For, given its natural meaning, the power granted Congress "To make Rules" to regulate "the land and naval Forces" would seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to persons who are actually members or part of the armed forces.  There is a compelling reason for construing the clause this way:  any expansion of court-martial jurisdiction like that in the 1950 Act necessarily encroaches on the jurisdiction of federal courts set up under Article III of the Constitution, where persons on trial are surrounded with more constitutional safeguards than in military tribunals.</p>\n<p>Article III provides for the establishment of a court system as one of the separate but coordinate branches of the National Government.  It is the primary, indeed the sole, business of these courts to try cases and controversies between individuals and between individuals and the Government.  This includes trial of criminal cases.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 350 U. S. 16</a></p><p> These courts are presided over by judges appointed for life, subject only to removal by impeachment.  Their compensation cannot be diminished during their continuance in office.  The provisions of Article III were designed to give judges maximum freedom from possible coercion or influence by the executive or legislative branches of the Government.  But the Constitution and the Amendments in the Bill of Rights show that the Founders were not satisfied with leaving determination of guilt or innocence to judges, even though wholly independent.  They further provided that no person should be held to answer in those courts for capital or other infamous crimes unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury drawn from the body of the people.  Other safeguards designed to protect defendants against oppressive governmental practices were included.  One of these was considered so important to liberty of the individual that it appears in two parts of the Constitution.  Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, commands that the</p>\n<p>"Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury, and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed."</p>\n<p>And the Sixth Amendment provides that,</p>\n<p>"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed. . . ."</p>\n<p>This right of trial by jury ranks very high in our catalogue of constitutional safeguards. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 350 U. S. 17</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We find nothing in the history or constitutional treatment of military tribunals which entitles them to rank along with Article III courts as adjudicators of the guilt or innocence of people charged with offenses for which they can be deprived of their life, liberty or property.  Unlike courts, it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise.  But trial of soldiers to maintain discipline is merely incidental to an army\'s primary fighting function.  To the extent that those responsible for performance of this primary function are diverted from it by the necessity of trying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not served.  And conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have, it still remains true that military tribunals have not been and probably never can be constituted in such way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts.  For instance, the Constitution does not provide life tenure for those performing judicial functions in military trials.  They are appointed by military commanders, and may be removed at will.  Nor does the Constitution protect their salaries, as it does judicial salaries.  Strides have been made toward making courts-martial less subject to the will of the executive department which appoints, supervises and ultimately controls them.  But, from the very nature of things, courts have more independence in passing on the life and liberty of people than do military tribunals.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a great difference between trial by jury and trial by selected members of the military forces.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 350 U. S. 18</a></p><p> It is true that military personnel, because of their training and experience, may be especially competent to try soldiers for infractions of military rules.  Such training is no doubt particularly important where an offense charged against a soldier is purely military, such as disobedience of an order, leaving post etc.  But whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to perform this task.  This idea is inherent in the institution of trial by jury.</p>\n<p>Juries fairly chosen from different walks of life bring into the jury box a variety of different experiences, feelings, intuitions and habits. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Such juries may reach completely different conclusions than would be reached by specialists in any single field, including specialists in the military field. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  On many occasions, fully known to the Founders of this country, jurors -- plain people -- have manfully stood up in defense of liberty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 350 U. S. 19</a></p><p> against the importunities of judges and despite prevailing hysteria and prejudices. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The acquittal of William Penn is an illustrious example. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Unfortunately, instances could also be cited where jurors have themselves betrayed the cause of justice by verdicts based on prejudice or pressures.  In such circumstances, independent trial judges and independent appellate judges have a most important place under our constitutional plan, since they have power to set aside convictions. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1950 Act here considered deprives of jury trial and sweeps under military jurisdiction over 3,000,000 persons who have become veterans since the Act became effective.  That number is bound to grow from year to year; there are now more than 3,000,000 men and women in uniform. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  These figures point up what would be the enormous scope of a holding that Congress could subject every ex-serviceman and woman in the land to trial by court-martial for any alleged offense committed while he or she had been a member of the armed forces.  Every veteran discharged since passage of the 1950 Act is subject to military trial for any offense punishable by as much as five years\' imprisonment unless the offense is now punishable in a civilian court.  And one need only glance at the Military Code to see what a vast number and variety of offenses are thus brought under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 350 U. S. 20</a></p><p> military jurisdiction. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Included within these are crimes such as murder, conspiracy, absence without leave, contempt toward officials, disrespect toward superior officers, willful or neglectful loss, damage, or destruction of government property, making false official statements, dueling, breach of the peace, forgery, fraud, assault, and many others. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  It is true that, with reference to some of these offenses, very minor ones, veterans cannot now be tried because of a presidential order fixing the punishment for such offenses at less than five years. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  But that amelioration of the Military Code may be temporary, since punishment can be raised or lowered at the will of the President.  It is also true that, under the present law, courts-martial have jurisdiction only if no civilian court does.  But that might also be changed by Congress.  Thus, there is no justification for treating the Act as a mere minor increase of congressional power to expand military jurisdiction.  It is a great change, both actually and potentially.</p>\n<p>Fear has been expressed that, if this law is not sustained, discharged soldiers may escape punishment altogether for crimes they commit while in the service.  But that fear </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 350 U. S. 21</a></p><p> is not warranted, and was not shared by the Judge Advocate General of the Army, who made a strong statement against passage of the law. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  He asked Congress to</p>\n<p>"confer jurisdiction upon Federal courts to try any person for an offense denounced by the [military] code if he is no longer subject thereto.  This would be consistent with the fifth amendment of the Constitution."</p>\n<p>The Judge Advocate General went on to tell Congress that,</p>\n<p>"If you expressly confer jurisdiction on the Federal courts to try such cases, you preserve the constitutional separation of military and civil courts, you save the military from a lot of unmerited grief, and you provide for a clean, constitutional method for disposing of such cases."</p>\n<p>It is conceded that it was wholly within the constitutional power of Congress to follow this suggestion and provide for federal district court trials of discharged soldiers accused of offenses committed while in the armed services.  This concession is justified.  U.S.Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, <em>and see, e.g., Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/137/202/case.html">137 U.

There can be no valid argument, therefore, that civilian ex-servicemen must be tried by court-martial or not tried at all.  If that is so, it is only because Congress has not seen fit to subject them to trial in federal district courts.</p>\n<p>None of the other reasons suggested by the Government is sufficient to justify a broad construction of the constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the armed forces.  That provision itself does not empower Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 350 U. S. 22</a></p><p> to deprive people of trials under Bill of Rights safeguards, and we are not willing to hold that power to circumvent those safeguards should be inferred through the Necessary and Proper Clause.  It is impossible to think that the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed by giving ex-servicemen the benefit of a civilian court trial when they are actually civilians.  And we are not impressed by the fact that some other countries which do not have our Bill of Rights indulge in the practice of subjecting civilians who were once soldiers to trials by courts-martial instead of trials by civilian courts. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>There are dangers lurking in military trials which were sought to be avoided by the Bill of Rights and Article III of our Constitution.  Free countries of the world have tried to restrict military tribunals to the narrowest jurisdiction deemed absolutely essential to maintaining discipline among troops in active service.  Even as late as the Seventeenth Century, standing armies and courts-martial were not established institutions in England. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Court-martial jurisdiction sprang from the belief that, within the military ranks, there is need for a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience and order.  But Army discipline will not be improved by court-martialing, rather than trying by jury, some civilian ex-soldier who has been wholly separated from the service for months, years or perhaps decades.  Consequently, considerations of discipline provide no excuse for new expansion of court-martial jurisdiction at the expense of the normal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 350 U.

The answer turns upon the constitutionality and construction of the applicable provisions of the Uniform Code of Military </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 350 U. S. 24</a></p><p> Justice, 64 Stat. 108, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 551 <em>et seq.,</em> under which the United States Air Force acted in this case.</p>\n<p>Whenever an enactment of Congress to cure weaknesses in criminal procedure is declared unconstitutional by this Court on the ground of lack of legislative power, the door is closed, for all practical purposes, forever on the method that Congress deems effective for correcting crime.  Only an overruling of this case can change today\'s constitutional determination.</p>\n<p>The judgment just announced turns loose, without trial or possibility of trial, a man accused of murder.  In future similar cases among the military, if Congress enacts the substitute law as the Court suggests, <em>ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/11/case.html#21">350 U. S. 21</a></span>, the accused must face a jury far removed from the scene of the alleged crime and before jurors without the understanding of the quality and character of a military crime possessed by those accustomed to administer the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Or perhaps those accused will be extradited and tried by foreign law.</p>\n<p>A dissent is justified, I think, if its argument may limit, in some degree, further interpreting limitations by the judiciary on the power granted by the Constitution to Congress "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" without the jury and venue requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  These requirements are appropriate for civil trials, but, by custom, our precedents and express language are inapplicable to "cases arising in the land or naval forces."</p>\n<p>Robert W. Toth, after service in the United States Air Force, was honorably discharged on December 8, 1952.  On April 8, 1953, formal charges were signed under the procedures required by the Uniform Code of Military Justice charging Toth with premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit murder. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The specifications under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 350 U. S. 25</a></p><p> charges alleged that the offenses were committed by Toth while an Airman First Class, United States Air Force, on September 27, 1952, at an air base in Korea, and the victim was a named Korean national.  It was further alleged that Toth was a civilian subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice under Article 3(a) thereof which provides:</p>\n<p>"Subject to the provisions of article 43, any person charged with having committed, while in a status in which he was subject to this code, an offense against this code, punishable by confinement of five years or more and for which the person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States or any State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia, shall not be relieved from amenability to trial by courts-martial by reason of the termination of said status."</p>\n<p>64 Stat. 109, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 553(a). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>On May 13, 1953, pursuant to orders originally issued by the Acting Secretary of the Air Force on April 30, 1953, and further supplemental orders through appropriate Air Force command channels, Toth was apprehended by Air Force police at his place of employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  On May 15, 1953, he was flown to Korea, where he arrived on May 18, 1953.</p>\n<p>This was the situation when the petition for habeas corpus was filed by the relator.  The Government did not question jurisdiction in the District Court, and, after argument, that court ordered the writ to issue. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Toth was returned to the United States and produced in court, whereupon the District Court ordered his discharge on the ground that, even if the Air Force police had authority to apprehend Toth, they had no legal power to transport him to a distant point for trial, or at least to do so without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 350 U. S. 26</a></p><p> a hearing.  The court therefore found it unnecessary to pass on the constitutional objections raised by the petitioner as to the invalidity of Article 3(a); 114 F.Supp. 468.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court, discharged the writ, and ordered Toth returned to the military authorities.  94 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 215 F.2d 22.  The Court of Appeals held that Article 3(a) of the Code was constitutionally valid, and that the Code provided the necessary authorization and machinery to apprehend and transport for trial, in the manner here followed, persons in civilian status who were amenable to courts-martial by reason of the provisions of Article 3(a).</p>\n<p>The Code was enacted May 5, 1950, after careful military and congressional study to assure that the military justice of the unified services would be in accordance with the present-day standards of fairness. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Article 3(a) was adopted in view of the decision of this Court in <em>Hirshberg v. Cooke,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/210/case.html">336 U. S. 210</a></span> (1949), holding the Articles for the Government of the Navy, then in force, did not allow trial on charges filed subsequent to honorable discharge "without a grant of congressional authority," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/210/case.html#215">336 U. S. 215</a></span>, although the charges arose from acts committed while the defendant was in military service.  The near escape from military justice of Army personnel accused of the theft in Germany of the Hesse crown jewels was also in mind. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It was thought that a serviceman\'s discharge should not bar his prosecution in a military court for crimes committed when subject to military discipline. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 350 U. S. 27</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The enactment of Article 3(a) was chosen instead of the alternative of federal district court jurisdiction, although thorough presentations of objections not only on constitutional, but also on policy grounds appear in the committee report and the Congressional Record. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The military were well aware, as was Congress, of possible unfavorable public reaction to extension of the jurisdiction of military courts to discharged veterans for alleged misdeeds during service.  The language of Article 3(a) was drawn to cover only the most serious offenses and restricted to those instances in which the guilty would otherwise escape trial or punishment in any American courts.  Although Congress, under Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 14, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] and the Necessary and Proper Clause, doubtless might have authorized the civil courts to try charges arising from violations of the Military Code during former service, even </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 350 U. S. 28</a></p><p> though committed on foreign soil, [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] it chose the method of Article 3(a).</p>\n<p>No question of accommodating the liberty of the citizen to requirements of the military through the interpretation of an ambiguous Act arises.  <em>Compare Ex parte Endo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/283/case.html">323 U. S. 283</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/283/case.html#300">323 U. S. 300</a></span>.  It is not for courts to question the wisdom of the legislation.  Its obvious purpose was to assure, insofar as discipline may do so, the proper conduct of our far-flung and numerous military personnel in foreign lands.  One need not stress the necessity of orderly conduct by the military on foreign posts for the maintenance of good relations in friendly or vanquished countries.  It also seems a reasonable choice that uniform treatment by courts-martial trial of all accused of crimes punishable by the Military Code is preferred for morale and disciplinary purposes to courts-martial trial only for those who remain in the service.  This case itself would make a good example of the difficulty of a federal district court trial.  We address ourselves to the constitutionality of Article 3(a).</p>\n<p>(a) The congressional power under Article I of the Constitution to regulate the armed forces is conceded by the Court to embrace the power to provide for trial by court-martial and military punishment for violations of the Military Code.  But the Court holds that that power ceases when the serviceman becomes a civilian.  Nothing, we think, in the words of Article I or in the history of that congressional power justifies limiting trial and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 350 U. S. 29</a></p><p> punishment by the military, for crimes committed by members of the armed services, to the period of service.  Certainly the power of Congress to provide for a military trial and punishment for a breach of the Military Code on charges brought before the end of enlistment or discharge may continue thereafter. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The crime charged against Toth was one covered by the Code.  The circumstance that he was discharged from the service prior to the detection of the alleged crime and prior to being charged with its commission should make no constitutional difference.</p>\n<p>Courts-martial are deeply rooted in history.  War is a grim business, requiring sacrifice of ease, opportunity, freedom from restraint, and liberty of action.  Experience has demonstrated that the law of the military must be capable of prompt punishment to maintain discipline.  The power to regulate the armed forces must have been granted to Congress so that it would have the authority over its armed forces that other nations have long exercised, subject only to limitations of the Constitution.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/65/case.html">Dynes v.

The Government calls our attention to the current provisions for military trial after discharge of other nations with legal background similar to ours.  Each of them allows such trials under varying conditions. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 350 U. S. 30</a></p><p> Whether English courts-martial before 1789 exercised jurisdiction over charges preferred after separation from service cannot be categorically asserted in view of the paucity of cases.  It would seem, however, that the language of Article I itself properly should be interpreted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 350 U. S. 31</a></p><p> to empower Congress to authorize courts-martial after separation from the services.  The crime charged was committed during service, and violated the Military Code.  Surely, when read with the Necessary and Proper Clause, the conclusion must follow.  Article 3(a) bears a reasonable relation to the "Government and Regulation" of the armed forces; it is appropriate and plainly adapted to that end.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v.

Congress was granted authority to regulate the armed forces in order to enforce obedience by members of the military establishment to military regulation during their service to the end that order may be ensured.  Disobedience may occur in nationally critical times.  What reason can there be for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 350 U.

Toth may be a civilian, but his crime was a violation of military regulations.</p>\n<p>Judicial history lends its weight to the conclusion that congressional power to institute criminal proceedings against a military person continues after the accused\'s discharge.  In 1863, the Congress enacted an Act to prevent and punish frauds upon the Government of the United States.  It provided that any person in the military </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 350 U. S. 33</a></p><p> forces shall be punished for fraud under military regulation "as the court-martial may adjudge, save the punishment of death."  12 Stat. 696-697, \xc2\xa7 1.  Under \xc2\xa7 2, jurisdiction of the court-martial was extended to dischargees. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  The provision for charge and court-martial after discharge was ruled constitutional in 1866 by Attorney General Stanbery. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  The section was held constitutional in 1873.  <em>In re Bogart,</em> 3 Fed.Cas. 796.  <em>See</em> other cases, <l=|350 11fn2="" 22|="" u.s.="">note 22, <em>infra.</em>  It was apparently held unconstitutional in 1946 under Article I in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, although the problem under the Fifth Amendment was also considered.  <em>United States ex rel. Flannery v. Commanding General,</em> 69 F.Supp. 661, 664. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] </l=|350></p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 350 U. S. 34</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is also to be noted that the present Uniform Code, Art. 4, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 554, provides that an officer dismissed by the President may request trial by Court-martial after such dismissal.  A similar provision was first enacted by Congress in 1865, \xc2\xa7 12, 13 Stat. 487, 489; <em>see</em> Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 64, 65.</p>\n<p>The Court finds a "compelling reason" for construing the clause for Army regulation more narrowly than has been done by the Congress and the Executive for many years.  This is that trial by Article III judges and juries offers safeguards to military offenders superior to those offered by courts-martial.  Under our judicial system, the use of juries has been found satisfactory in civil life.  The argument for the adoption of civil trials for the military might appeal to Congress, if presented there.  But, with due respect to the premise of the majority, the assumed superiority of the civil courts in the trial of service crimes should have no force in the construction of the constitutional power of Congress to enact Article 3(a) of the Code.  Belief that an accused has better opportunities to escape conviction in a civil court should not influence a conclusion as to constitutional power.  As later appears in this opinion, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments except the land and naval forces from their commands.  The advantages and disadvantages of indictment, venue and jury trial for the military have been weighed and determined adversely to the Court\'s conclusion by the Constitution and the Congress.  Certainly the number of former members of the armed services now living is immaterial to the constitutional issue, as are the "dangers" suggested to be "lurking in military trials."  The military is in position to give its personnel a fair trial.  The only logical ground for declaring Article 3(a) unconstitutional is that military crimes cannot be so punished because such procedure is beyond the reach of the congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="35">Page 350 U. S. 35</a></p><p> authority to make rules for government of military personnel.  Subsequent punishment by military procedures will help discipline during service.  Such a conclusion by Congress is not strained or unreasonable, but a natural use of its power to make regulations for the armed services.  The choice is for Congress, not the Court.</p>\n<p>(b) Another constitutional problem arises, <em>i.e.,</em> that Article 3(a) is unlawful by reason of the limitations on prosecutions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>The argument upon the Sixth Amendment requires only summary treatment.  The rights to a speedy and public trial, impartiality of the triers, information as to the charge, confrontation, compulsory process for witnesses and assistance of counsel are not in issue.  This accused will not have for his trial a jury of the State and district of the crime, previously ascertained by our law.  That is an impossibility in the circumstances of this case.  Nor can it be that the Sixth Amendment requirements as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 350 U. S. 36</a></p><p> to jury and place were intended to apply to the "cases arising in the land or naval forces" which were excepted from the protection of the grand jury by the Fifth.  That would abrogate the authority of Congress to govern the military by courts-martial.  It was so announced by this Court, unanimously, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html">Ex parte Milligan,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 2,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#122">71 U.

S. 37</a></p><p> Defendants in cases arising in the armed forces, we think, are not entitled to demand trial by jury, whether the crime was committed on foreign soil or at a place within a State or previously ascertained district.</p>\n<p>Turning to the Fifth Amendment, the critical words are obviously "cases arising in the land or naval forces."  The events leading to the taking of Toth into custody occurred while he was enlisted.  They constituted then and now a violation of the Uniform Code.  Relator would limit the quoted words to cases where charges had been filed during service.  She stresses the phrase "when in actual service," but this Court has held, and all the history of our courts-martial shows, that such phrase has reference only to "cases arising . . . in the Militia."  <em>Johnson v. Sayre,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/158/109/case.html">158 U. S. 109</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/158/109/case.html#114">158 U. S. 114</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Fifth, like the other early amendments, arose from the determination to protect the rights of citizens.  As the Articles of Confederation, Article 9, granted authority to the central government to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces, the Nation was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 350 U. S. 38</a></p><p> conversant with the problem.  In the state conventions for ratification of the Constitution, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island suggested words for regulation of the armed forces quite similar to the ones adopted by Congress. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  It will be observed that two employ "arise."  Three speak of "cases."  Since the state suggestions were made as the result of consideration of the proposed Constitution, it is quite natural that the language of Article III concerning the judicial power would find an echo in the suggestions.  Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, reads,</p>\n<p>"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority. . . ."</p>\n<p>When the Congress considered the Act against military fraud in 1863, <l=|350 11fn2="" 13|="" u.s.="">note 13, <em>supra,</em> no one suggested that a "case," the prosecution for which under the Act did not </l=|350></p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 350 U. S. 39</a></p><p> begin until after discharge of a serviceman, would not be a "case arising in the land or naval forces."  The concern of Congress was with the liability of contractors, as part of military personnel, under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act, when they had no true military service status. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Because not service-connected, the contractors\' clause has been held unconstitutional.  <em>Ex parte Henderson,</em> 11 Fed.Cas. 1067, 1071.</p>\n<p>The word "case," of course, might refer to litigation -- a charge or complaint brought in court, here a prosecution.  But it seems to us that its meaning, as used in the constitutional clauses under consideration, is a state of facts for judicial action, <em>i.e.,</em> the series of events that creates an enforceable right or obligation.  The context in which it is used bears on the final definition.  Here, "cases arising" is more specific than the word "case" alone.  The Government gives us several citations to cases applying the meaning for which it contends. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 350 U. S. 40</a></p><p> Relator does the same. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Article III uses "cases arising" under federal law to indicate the extent of possible federal jurisdiction over legal rights or duties created by the laws of the United States.  The meaning of "cases arising" in Article III and the Fifth Amendment must be determined by their purpose.  That purpose is similar -- to mark the source of the cause of action that ripens into a civil complaint or criminal charge.  However restricted the word "case" may be, its use with "arising" points to the source of the litigation.  If a case is claimed to exist only after institution of legal proceedings, nevertheless that case has its roots, it arises, in the events that give life to the cause of action.  When a case so arises was stated thus in <em>Gully v. First Nat. Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html#112">299 U. S. 112</a></span>, in an opinion concerning the removal statute, where </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 350 U. S. 41</a></p><p> removal was asked because the state suit was alleged to have arisen under federal law:</p>\n<p>"To bring a case within the statute, a right or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff\'s cause of action. . . .  The right or immunity must be such that it will be supported if the Constitution or laws of the United States are given one construction or effect, and defeated if they receive another. . . ."</p>\n<p>One of the purposes of the Fifth Amendment by this exception was to preserve the separation of military law from the requirements of civil law.  The regulation of the armed forces by Congress under cl. 14 of \xc2\xa7 8, Art. I, was to be left for legislative judgment that discipline might be maintained by speedy trial and punishment in accordance with military law.  The reasons, set out in our discussion of Article I power to regulate the armed forces, need not be repeated here.  We ask ourselves, "What law is the basis of this prosecution?"  The answer is the Military Code.  If so, the case arises "in the land or naval forces."</p>\n<p>That conclusion has the support of the weight of the precedents dealing with this phase of the Fifth Amendment.  To meet the argument of defendant that jurisdiction must attach before discharge, it was said in the <em>Bogart</em> case, 3 Fed.Cas. 796, 799:</p>\n<p>"Among the ordinary and most common definitions of the word \'arise\' are \'to proceed, to issue, to spring,\' and a case arising in the land or naval forces, upon a fair and reasonable construction of the whole article, appears to us to be a case proceeding, issuing or springing from acts in violation of the naval laws and regulations committed while in the naval forces or service. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 350 U. S. 42</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This statement has been strengthened by the accord given the argument by other courts. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p>(c) The Court, of course, does not gainsay the constitutional authority of Congress to adopt a military code for regulation of members of the armed forces without regard to the generally applicable requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  It holds that, where the constitutional safeguards of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for a citizen\'s freedom from tyranny are at stake, they should not be withdrawn except through absolute necessity.  There is no such necessity here, for it would have been possible to have provided a proper civil trial with the full protection of the applicable clauses of the Amendments.  But here we are considering an exception to the safeguards offered by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  That exception has been written into the Constitution from the experience of history to protect the discipline of the armed forces.  Of course, that exception from the protections of these Amendments should be strictly construed to hold those excluded to the minimum as was done in <em>Ex parte Henderson, supra,</em> p. 39.  Construction of the Constitution, however, should not be allowed to emasculate the natural meaning of language designed to protect the Nation in the regulation of its armed forces.</p>\n<p>What we have argued in the foregoing pages of this opinion supports our conclusion on this tendered rule of construction.  Granting that there are possible means of affording civil trials to persons discharged from the Army for military crimes committed during their service, we think that Congress has power to provide for punishment of these military crimes under the constitutional exceptions discussed.  Such punishment, if our analysis of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="43">Page 350 U. S. 43</a></p><p> Article I and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments is correct, will be for military crimes of servicemen, not of civilians, and for the maintenance of discipline in the armed forces.  The relator phrases strongly her argument against Toth\'s prosecution by courts-martial.  To her, the issue is "military dictatorship."  Though she concedes that Congress may have merely desired to bar absolution from crime by discharge from service, such purpose, she argues, should not override the Constitution, or be allowed to foreshadow a "military dictatorship."  She forebodes that every petty crime may be included, and limitation of prosecution be extended, until all discharged servicemen shall live their lives under fear of the Military.  The law still has degrees of harshness, and courts and legislatures must act in reason.  The possibility of individual abuse of power is ever present even under our Constitution, but the probability of obliteration of any such tendency through judicial, executive or legislative action is the citizen\'s protection under the Constitution.  A fear that punishment by courts-martial of servicemen after discharge may bear a threat to the rights and security of citizens is extravagant.  It is true today, as it was in the time of the Founding Fathers, that the methods for maintenance of Army discipline should be subject to public opinion as expressed through Congress.  If trial of discharged servicemen by courts-martial under the carefully defined provisions of Article 3(a) seems harsh or hurtful to liberty, the door of Congress remains open for amelioration.  This decision that a veteran, let out of the military forces before charges, must, by the Constitution, be tried by the civil courts for his military crimes impairs congressional power.  Now only another Constitutional Amendment or a reversal of today\'s judgment will enable Congress to deal consistently with those violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  We cannot agree that those who adopted the constitutional provisions for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 350 U. S. 44</a></p><p> protection of military discipline intended such a result.  Toth\'s alleged accomplices have been convicted by military courts, and we see no reason why he should not be tried as proposed.</p>\n<p>The decision below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The charges were violations of Articles 118 and 81, respectively, of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 712, 675.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Article 43 is the statute of limitations applicable to offenses punishable under the Code, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 618.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>113 F.Supp. 330.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

The trial took place after his dismissal from his command and the service.  The King, George II, submitted the question of jurisdiction of the court-martial to the twelve judges composing the Courts of King\'s Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer, headed by Lord Mansfield, and received the following advisory answer:</p>\n<p>"In obedience to your Majesty\'s commands, signified to us by a letter . . . referring to us the following question, \'Whether an officer of the army having been dismissed from his Majesty\'s service, and having no military employment, is triable by a Court Martial for a military offence lately committed by him while in actual service and pay as an officer?\'"</p>\n<p>"We have taken the same into consideration, and see no ground to doubt of the legality of the jurisdiction of a Court Martial in the case put by the above question."</p>\n<p>The judges ended with a reservation of the privilege of changing their minds if the matter were judicially presented, apparently in accordance with the practice in such advisory opinions.  <em>See</em> note, 28 Eng.Rep. 941.  II Eden\'s Chancery Reports, App. p. 371.  <em>See</em> Trials, Courts Martial -- Sackville, 1760.  On conviction, the King directed the sentence be recorded in the order book of every regiment, British and American.  In view of the prominence of the parties and the subsequent distinguished career of Lord George Sackville, who died in 1785 after having been advanced in 1782 to the peerage as Viscount Sackville for his services in Parliament, the Irish administration, and as Secretary of State for the Colonies, the case could hardly have escaped the notice of the members of the Constitutional Convention.  <em>See</em> VII Dictionary of Nat.Biography 1110; 4 Smollett, History of England, 337; Tytler, Military Law (2d ed.), 113. 8 Op.Atty.Gen. 328.  <em>But see</em> 31 Op.Atty.Gen. 521; Clode, Martial and Military Law, 92.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>It must be noted, however, that a leading military authority is against that view.  <em>See</em> Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 105, although he admits the weight of the precedents is against him.</p>\n<p><em>See, however,</em> a comparable authority, Edmund M.

The great minds of the country have differed on the correct interpretation to be given to various provisions of the Federal Constitution, and judicial decision has been often invoked to settle their true meaning; but, until recently, no one ever doubted that the right of trial by jury was fortified in the organic law against the power of attack.  It is <em>now</em> assailed; but if ideas can be expressed in words, and language has any meaning, <em>this right</em> -- one of the most valuable in a free country -- is preserved to everyone accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service.  The sixth amendment affirms that, \'in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury,\' language broad enough to embrace all persons and cases; but the fifth, recognizing the necessity of an indictment or presentment before anyone can be held to answer for high crimes, \'<em>excepts</em> cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or public danger,\' and the framers of the Constitution doubtless meant to limit the right of trial by jury in the sixth amendment to those persons who were subject to indictment or presentment in the fifth."</p>\n<p>The four who concurred agreed with the majority on this point:</p>\n<p>"The Constitution itself provides for military government, as well as for civil government.  And we do not understand it to be claimed that the civil safeguards of the Constitution have application in cases within the proper sphere of the former."</p>\n<p>"What, then, is that proper sphere?  Congress has power to raise and support armies; to provide and maintain a navy, to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, and to provide for governing such part of the militia as may be in the service of the United States."</p>\n<p>"It is not denied that the power to make rules for the government of the army and navy is a power to provide for trial and punishment by military courts without a jury.  It has been so understood and exercised from the adoption of the Constitution to the present time."</p>\n<p>"Nor, in our judgment, does the fifth, or any other amendment, abridge that power.  \'Cases arising in the land and naval forces, or in the militia in actual service in time of war or public danger\' are expressly excepted from the fifth amendment, \'that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\' and it is admitted that the exception applies to the other amendments as well as to the fifth."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"We think, therefore, that the power of Congress, in the government of the land and naval forces and of the militia, is not at all affected by the fifth or any other amendment."</p>\n<p>4 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#137">71 U.

JUSTICE REED, and I would add another reason why I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>A civilian not under the jurisdiction of the Military Code has a right to be tried in a civil court for an alleged crime as a civilian.  My trouble is that I don\'t think Toth was a full-fledged civilian.  By 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 553, Congress had retained jurisdiction to try Toth for a crime he had committed while a soldier and for which admittedly he could have been tried by court-martial if the United States had discovered his crime one minute before discharge.</p>\n<p>He was not a full-fledged civilian under his discharge.  He was still a soldier to answer in court-martial for the crime he had committed while a soldier.  He had a conditional discharge only.  The United States clearly reserved the right to charge and try him by court-martial for a crime committed while in the status of a soldier.  This is the way Congress had provided for his trial.  No other way was provided.  That it may have provided another way is not to say the way provided is invalid.</p>\n<p>I know of no reason why Congress could not pass this statute, 50 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 553, retaining court-martial jurisdiction over Toth to answer for a crime he allegedly committed when he was clearly subject to court-martial.  <em>Kahn v. Anderson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/1/case.html">255 U.

S. 45</a></p><p> for murder and conspiracy to commit murder, even though the crime was alleged to have been committed within the limits of a state.  Congress had made no provision for retention of status in that case as it had in this case, yet the Court implied the continuing military status to warrant the jurisdiction.  No implied status is necessary here.  It is expressly reserved by statute.  Toth remained in that status by virtue of the statute.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
