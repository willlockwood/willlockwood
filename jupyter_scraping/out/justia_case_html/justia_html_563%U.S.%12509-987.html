The typical assertion of taxpayer standing rests on unjustifiable economic and political speculation.  See <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a>; <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a>.  When a government expends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily suffer.  Even assuming the State\xe2\x80\x99s coffers are depleted, finding injury would require a court to speculate \xe2\x80\x9cthat elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax bill to make up a deficit.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/332/index.html">547 U. S. 332</a>, 344.  And to find redressability a court must assume that, were the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 remedy allowed, \xe2\x80\x9clegislators [would] pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  These conclusions apply to the present cases.  The costs of education may be a significant portion of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget, but the tax credit, by facilitating the operation of both religious and secular private schools, could relieve the burden on public schools and provide cost savings to the State.  Even if the tax credit had an adverse effect on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s budget, causation and redressability problems would remain.  To find a particular injury in fact would require speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by increasing respondents\xe2\x80\x99 tax liability. <em> </em>A causation finding would depend on the additional assumption that any tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credit.  And respondents have not established that an injunction against the credit\xe2\x80\x99s application would prompt Arizona legislators to \xe2\x80\x9cpass along [any] increased revenue [as] tax reductions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit does not fall within the narrow exception to the rule against taxpayer standing established in <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen</em>, <em>supra.</em>  There, federal taxpayers had standing to mount an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal statute providing General Treasury funds to support, <em>inter alia</em>, textbook purchases for religious schools.  To have standing under <em>Flast, </em>taxpayers must show (1) a \xe2\x80\x9clogical link\xe2\x80\x9d between the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayer status \xe2\x80\x9cand the type of legislative enactment attacked,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9ca nexus\xe2\x80\x9d between such taxpayer status and \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 102.  Considering the two requirements together, <em>Flast </em>explained that<em> </em>individuals suffer a particular injury when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of \xe2\x80\x9cthe taxing and spending power,\xe2\x80\x9d their property is transferred through the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Treasury to a sectarian entity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s allegation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 106.  The STO tax credit does not visit the injury identified in <em>Flast</em>.  When the Government spends funds from the General Treasury, dissenting taxpayers know that they have been made to contribute to an establishment in violation of conscience.  In contrast, a tax credit allows dissenting taxpayers to use their own funds in accordance with their own consciences.  Here, the STO tax credit does not \xe2\x80\x9cextrac[t] and spen[d]\xe2\x80\x9d a conscientious dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s funds in service of an establishment, 392 U. S.em&gt;., at 106, or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98force a citizen to contribute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to a sectarian organization, <em>id.</em>, at 103.  Rather, taxpayers are free to pay their own tax bills without contributing to an STO, to contribute to a religious or secular STO of their choice, or to contribute to other charitable organizations.  Because the STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax, respondents have not alleged an injury for standing purposes.  Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability.  When the government collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth; the resulting subsidy of religious activity is, under <em>Flast</em>, traceable to the government\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures; and an injunction against those expenditures would address taxpayer-plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 objections of conscience.  Here, by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds.  Private citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs.  Any injury the objectors may suffer are not fairly traceable to the government.  And, while an injunction most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary position\xe2\x80\x94that Arizonans benefiting from the tax credit in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs\xe2\x80\x94assumes that all income is government property, even if it has not come into the tax collector\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  That premise finds no basis in standing jurisprudence.  This Court has sometimes reached the merits in Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits as opposed to governmental expenditures.  See <em>Mueller</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/388/index.html">463 U. S. 388</a>; <em>Nyquist</em> v. <em>Mauclet</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/1/index.html">432 U. S. 1</a>; <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>McNair</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/734/index.html">413 U.

But those cases did not mention standing and so do not stand for the proposition that no jurisdictional defects existed.  Moreover, it is far from clear that any nonbinding <em>sub silentio </em>standing determinations in those cases depended on <em>Flast</em>, as there are other ways of establishing standing in Establishment Clause cases involving tax benefits.

STOs use these contributions to provide scholarships to students attending private schools, many of which are religious.  Respondents are a group of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax credit as a violation of Establishment Clause principles under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  After the Arizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment Clause claim on the merits, respondents sought intervention from the Federal Judiciary.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court, parties seeking relief must show that they have standing under Article III of the Constitution. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Standing in Establishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways.  Some plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the direct harm of what is claimed to be an establishment of religion, such as a mandatory prayer in a public school classroom.  See <em>School Dist. of Abington Township</em> v. <em>Schempp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a>, 224, n. 9 (1963).  Other plaintiffs may demonstrate standing on the ground that they have incurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of their religion.  Those costs and benefits can result from alleged discrimination in the tax code, such as when the availability of a tax exemption is conditioned on religious affiliation.  See <em>Texas Monthly, Inc.</em> v. <em>Bullock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/1/index.html">489 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (1989) (plurality opinion).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For their part, respondents contend that they have standing to challenge Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s STO tax credit for one and only one reason: because they are Arizona taxpayers.  But the mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally deemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court.  To overcome that rule, respondents must rely on an exception created in <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968).  For the reasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advantage of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrow exception to the general rule against taxpayer standing.  As a consequence, respondents lacked standing to commence this action, and their suit must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents challenged \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089, a provision of the Arizona Tax Code.  See 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931087, codified, as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 (West Supp. 2010).  Section\xc2\xa043\xe2\x80\x931089 allows Arizona taxpayers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to $500 per person and $1,000 per married couple for contributions to STOs.  \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(A).  If the credit exceeds an individual\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability, the credit\xe2\x80\x99s unused portion can be carried forward up to five years.  \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(D).  Under a version of \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 in effect during the pendency of this lawsuit, a charitable organization could be deemed an STO only upon certain conditions.  See \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 (West 2006).  The organization was required to be exempt from federal taxation under \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(G)(3) (West Supp. 2005).  It could not limit its scholarships to students attending only one school.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And it had to allocate \xe2\x80\x9cat least ninety per cent of its annual revenue for educational scholarships or tuition grants\xe2\x80\x9d to children attending qualified schools.  <em>Ibid</em>.  A \xe2\x80\x9cqualified school,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, was defined in part as a private school in Arizona that did not discriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status, or national origin.  \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(G)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona taxpayers challenged \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089, invoking both the United States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution.  The Arizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 claims on the merits.  <em>Kotterman </em>v. <em>Killian</em>, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P.\xc2\xa02d 606 (1999).

It named the Director of the Arizona Department of Revenue as defendant.  The Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Respondents alleged that \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 allows STOs \xe2\x80\x9cto use State income-tax revenues to pay tuition for students at religious schools,\xe2\x80\x9d some of which \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate on the basis of religion in selecting students.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint in No. 00\xe2\x80\x930287 (D Ariz.), \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb629\xe2\x80\x9331, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 09\xe2\x80\x93987, pp. 125a\xe2\x80\x93126a.  Respondents requested, among other forms of relief, an injunction against the issuance of \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 tax credits for contributions to religious STOs.  The District Court dismissed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit as jurisdictionally barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  This Court agreed with the Court of\nAppeals and affirmed.  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a> (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization and other interested parties intervened.  The District Court once more dismissed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit, this time for failure to state a claim.  Once again, the Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that respondents had standing under <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <em>supra.</em>  562 F.\xc2\xa03d 1002 (CA9 2009).  Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals ruled that respondents had stated a claim that \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The full Court of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges dissenting.  586 F.\xc2\xa03d 649 (CA9 2009).  This Court granted certiorari.  560 U.

In the English legal tradition, the need to redress an injury resulting from a specific dispute taught the efficacy of judicial resolution and gave legitimacy to judicial decrees.  The importance of resolving specific cases was visible, for example, in the incremental approach of the common law and in equity\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of exceptional circumstances.  The Framers paid heed to these lessons.  See U. S.

The legislative and executive departments of the Federal Government, no less than the judicial department, have a duty to defend the Constitution.  See U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa03.

Absent special circumstances, however, standing cannot be based on a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s mere status as a taxpayer.  This Court has rejected the general proposition that an individual who has paid taxes has a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds are not <em>used </em>by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hein</em> v. <em>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/587/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/587/index.html">551 U. S. 587</a>, 599 (2007) (plurality opinion).  This precept has been referred to as the rule against taxpayer standing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrinal basis for the rule was discussed in <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a> (1923) (decided with<em> Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>).  There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had alleged that certain federal expenditures were in excess\nof congressional authority under the Constitution.  The plaintiff argued that she had standing to raise her claim because she had an interest in the Government Treasury and because the allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of Government funds would affect her personal tax liability.  The Court rejected those arguments.  The \xe2\x80\x9ceffect upon future taxation, of any payment out of funds,\xe2\x80\x9d was too \xe2\x80\x9cremote, fluctuating and uncertain\xe2\x80\x9d to give rise to a case or controversy.  <em>Id.</em>, at 487.  And the taxpayer-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court recognized, was necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cshared with millions of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  As a consequence, <em>Frothingham</em> held that the taxpayer-plaintiff had not presented a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial controversy\xe2\x80\x9d appropriate for resolution in federal court but rather a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter of public \xe2\x80\xa6 concern\xe2\x80\x9d that could be pursued only through the political process.  <em>Id</em>., at 487\xe2\x80\x93489.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a second pertinent case, <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a> (1952), the Court considered <em>Frothingham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on taxpayer standing in connection with an alleged Establishment Clause violation.  A New Jersey statute had provided that public school teachers would read Bible verses to their students at the start of each schoolday.  A plaintiff sought to have the law enjoined, asserting standing based on her status as a taxpayer.  Writing for the Court, Justice Jackson reiterated the foundational role that Article III standing plays in our separation of powers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The party who invokes the power [of the federal courts] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Doremus</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 434 (quoting <em>Frothingham</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 488).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe plaintiff in <em>Doremus</em> lacked any \xe2\x80\x9cdirect and particular financial interest\xe2\x80\x9d in the suit, and, as a result, a decision on the merits would have been merely \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory.\xe2\x80\x9d  342 U. S., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435.  It followed that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations did not give rise to a case or controversy subject to judicial resolution under Article III.<em>  Ibid</em>.  Cf. <em>School Dist. of Abington Township</em> v. <em>Schempp</em>, 374 U. S., at 224, n.\xc2\xa09 (finding standing where state laws required Bible readings or prayer in public schools, not because plaintiffs were state taxpayers but because their children were enrolled in public schools and so were \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly affected\xe2\x80\x9d by the challenged laws).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holdings consistent with <em>Frothingham </em>and <em>Doremus</em>, more recent decisions have<em> </em>explained that claims of taxpayer standing rest on unjustifiable economic and political speculation.  When a government expends resources or declines to impose a tax, its budget does not necessarily suffer.  On the contrary, the purpose of many governmental expenditures and tax benefits is \xe2\x80\x9cto spur economic activity, which in turn <em>increases </em>government revenues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DaimlerChrysler</em>, 547 U. S., at 344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expenditure or tax benefit depletes the government\xe2\x80\x99s coffers.  To find injury, a court must speculate \xe2\x80\x9cthat elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax bill to make up a deficit.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid</em>.  And to find redressability, a court must assume that, were the remedy the taxpayers seek to be allowed, \xe2\x80\x9clegislators will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It would be \xe2\x80\x9cpure speculation\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that an injunction against a government expenditure or tax benefit \xe2\x80\x9cwould result in any actual tax relief\xe2\x80\x9d for a taxpayer-plaintiff.  <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html">490 U. S. 605</a>, 614 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These well-established principles apply to the present cases.  Respondents may be right that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s STO tax credits have an estimated annual value of over $50 million.  See Brief for Respondent Winn et\xc2\xa0al. 42; see also Arizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Tax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 48 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010) (reporting the total estimated \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d of STO tax credits claimed over a 1-year period).  The education of its young people is, of course, one of the State\xe2\x80\x99s principal missions and responsibilities; and the consequent costs will make up a significant portion of the state budget.  That, however, is just the beginning of the analysis.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By helping students obtain scholarships to private schools, both religious and secular, the STO program might relieve the burden placed on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s public schools.  The result could be an immediate and permanent cost savings for the State.  See Brief for Petitioner Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization 31 (discussing studies indicating that the STO program may on net save the State money); see also <em>Mueller</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/388/index.html">463 U. S. 388</a>, 395 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cBy educating a substantial number of students [private] schools relieve public schools of a correspondingly great burden\xe2\x80\x94to the benefit of all taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d).  Underscoring the potential financial benefits of the STO program, the average value of an STO scholarship may be far less than the average cost of educating an Arizona public school student.  See Brief for Petitioner Garriott 38.  Because it encourages scholarships for attendance at private schools, the STO tax credit may not cause the State to incur any financial loss.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget, problems would remain.  To conclude there is a particular injury in fact would require speculation that Arizona lawmakers react to revenue shortfalls by increasing respondents\xe2\x80\x99 tax liability. <em> DaimlerChrysler</em>, 547 U. S., at 344.  A finding of causation would depend on the additional determination that any tax increase would be traceable to the STO tax credits, as distinct from other governmental expenditures or other tax benefits.  Respondents have not established that an injunction against application of the STO tax credit would prompt Arizona legislators to \xe2\x80\x9cpass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Those matters, too, are conjectural.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of the inferential steps to show causation and redressability depends on premises as to which there remains considerable doubt.  The taxpayers have not shown that any interest they have in protecting the State Treasury would be advanced.  Even were they to show some closer link, that interest is still of a general character, not particular to certain persons.  Nor have the taxpayers shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition credit scheme.  The rule against taxpayer standing, a rule designed both to avoid speculation and to insist on particular injury, applies to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit.  The taxpayers, then, must rely on an exception to the rule, an exception next to be considered.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The primary contention of respondents, of course, is that, despite the general rule that taxpayers lack standing to object to expenditures alleged to be unconstitutional, their suit falls within the exception established by <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a>.  It must be noted at the outset that, as this Court has explained, <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding provides a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe general rule against taxpayer standing.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 618 (1988).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At issue in <em>Flast</em> was the standing of federal taxpayers to object, on First Amendment grounds, to a congressional statute that allowed expenditures of federal funds from the General Treasury to support, among other programs, \xe2\x80\x9cinstruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in religious schools, and to purchase textbooks and other instructional materials for use in such schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 85\xe2\x80\x9386.<em>  Flast</em> held that taxpayers have standing when two conditions are met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first condition is that there must be a \xe2\x80\x9clogical link\xe2\x80\x9d between the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayer status \xe2\x80\x9cand the type of legislative enactment attacked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 102.  This condition was not satisfied in <em>Doremus</em> because the statute challenged in that case\xe2\x80\x94providing for the recitation of Bible passages in public schools\xe2\x80\x94involved at most an \xe2\x80\x9cincidental expenditure of tax funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flast,</em> 392 U. S., at 102.  In <em>Flast</em>, by contrast, the allegation was that the Federal Government violated the Establishment Clause in the exercise of its legislative authority both to collect and spend tax dollars.  <em>Id</em>., at 103.  In the decades since <em>Flast</em>,<em> </em>the Court has been careful to enforce this requirement.  See <em>Hein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/587/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/587/index.html">551 U.

In <em>Frothingham</em>, by contrast, the claim was that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority without regard to any specific prohibition.  392 U. S., at 104\xe2\x80\x93105.  Confirming that <em>Flast </em>turned on the unique features of Establishment Clause violations, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cdeclined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hein</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 609 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/index.html"></a><a href="/us/418/166/index.html">418 U.

As <em>Flast </em>put it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s allegation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 106.  <em>Flast </em>thus<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cunderstood the \xe2\x80\x98injury\xe2\x80\x99 alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very \xe2\x80\x98extract[ion] and spen[ding]\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\x98tax money\xe2\x80\x99 in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DaimlerChrysler</em>, 547 U.

In 1785, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia considered a \xe2\x80\x9ctax levy to support teachers of the Christian religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flast</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 104, n. 24; see A Bill Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion, reprinted in <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html">330 U. S. 1</a>, 74 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).  Under the proposed assessment bill, taxpayers would direct their payments to Christian societies of their choosing.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If a taxpayer made no such choice, the General Assembly was to divert his funds to \xe2\x80\x9cseminaries of learning,\xe2\x80\x9d at least some of which \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly would have been religious in character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger </em>v<em>.

However the \xe2\x80\x9cseminaries\xe2\x80\x9d provision might have functioned in practice, critics took the position that the proposed bill threatened compulsory religious contributions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776\xe2\x80\x931787, pp.\xc2\xa0133\xe2\x80\x93134 (1977); H.

In Madison\xe2\x80\x99s view, government should not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flast</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103<em> </em>(quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).  This Madisonian prohibition does not depend on the amount of property conscripted for sectarian ends.  Any such taking, even one amounting to \xe2\x80\x9cthree pence only,\xe2\x80\x9d violates conscience.  392 U. S., at 103; cf. <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The proposed bill ultimately died in committee; and the General Assembly instead enacted legislation forbidding \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled\xe2\x80\x9d support of religion.  See A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 545\xe2\x80\x93546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950); see also <em>Flast</em>,<em> </em>392 U. S., at 104, n.\xc2\xa024.  Madison himself went on to become, as <em>Flast </em>put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe leading architect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 103.  <em>Flast </em>was thus informed by \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific evils\xe2\x80\x9d identified in the public arguments of \xe2\x80\x9cthose who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 103\xe2\x80\x93104; see also Feldman, Intellectual Origins of the Establishment Clause, 77 N.\xc2\xa0Y. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 346, 351 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Framers\xe2\x80\x99 generation worried that conscience would be violated if citizens were required to pay taxes to support religious institutions with whose beliefs they disagreed\xe2\x80\x9d); McConnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 933, 936\xe2\x80\x93939 (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate their standing to challenge the STO tax credit.  In their view the tax credit is, for <em>Flast </em>purposes, best understood as a governmental expenditure.  That is incorrect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental expenditures can have similar economic consequences, at least for beneficiaries whose tax liability is sufficiently large to take full advantage of the credit.  Yet tax credits and governmental expenditures do not both implicate individual taxpayers in sectarian activities.  A dissenter whose tax dollars are \xe2\x80\x9cextracted and spent\xe2\x80\x9d knows that he has in some small measure been made to contribute to an establishment in violation of conscience.  <em>Flast</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 106.  In that instance the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s direct and particular connection with the establishment does not depend on economic speculation or political conjecture.  The connection would exist even if the conscientious dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability were unaffected or reduced.  See <em>DaimlerChrysler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 348\xe2\x80\x93349.  When the government declines to impose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection between dissenting taxpayer and alleged establishment.  Any financial injury remains speculative.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other citizens to retain control over their own funds in accordance with their own consciences.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinction between governmental expenditures and tax credits refutes respondents\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of standing.  When Arizona taxpayers choose to contribute to STOs, they spend their own money, not money the State has collected from respondents or from other taxpayers.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 does not \xe2\x80\x9cextrac[t] and spen[d]\xe2\x80\x9d a conscientious dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s funds in service of an establishment, <em>Flast</em>, 392 U.

On the contrary, respondents and other Arizona taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills, without contributing to an STO.  Respondents are likewise able to contribute to an STO of their choice, either religious or secular.  And respondents also have the option of contributing to other charitable organizations, in which case respondents may become eligible for a tax deduction or a different tax credit.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931088 (West Supp. 2010).  The STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not visit the injury identified in <em>Flast</em>.  It follows that respondents have neither alleged an injury for standing purposes under general rules nor met the <em>Flast </em>exception.  Finding standing under these circumstances would be more than the extension of <em>Flast </em>\xe2\x80\x9cto the limits of its logic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hein</em>, 551 U. S.<em>,</em> at 615 (plurality opinion).  It would be a departure from <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s stated rationale.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements of causation and redressability.  When the government collects and spends taxpayer money, governmental choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth.  In that case a resulting subsidy of religious activity is, for purposes of <em>Flast</em>, traceable to the government\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures.  And an injunction against those expenditures would address the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer-plaintiffs.  See <em>DaimlerChrysler</em>, 547 U. S., at 344.  Here, by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds.  Private citizens create private STOs; STOs choose beneficiary schools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs.  While the State, at the outset, affords the opportunity to create and contribute to an STO, the tax credit system is implemented by private action and with no state intervention.  Objecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not the State, decide to contribute and in fact make the contribution.  These considerations prevent any injury the objectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the government.  And while an injunction against application of the tax credit most likely would reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments.  As a result, any injury suffered by respondents would not be remedied by an injunction limiting the tax credit\xe2\x80\x99s operation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that Arizonans who benefit from \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 tax credits in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs.  In respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax deductions do not, since only the former yield a dollar-for-dollar reduction in final tax liability.  See Brief for Respondent Winn et\xc2\xa0al. 5\xe2\x80\x936; Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  But what matters under <em>Flast</em> is whether sectarian STOs receive government funds drawn from general tax revenues, so that moneys have been extracted from a citizen and handed to a religious institution in violation of the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s conscience.  Under that inquiry, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument fails.  Like contributions that lead to charitable tax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits are not owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from taxpayers to private organizations.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary position assumes that income should be treated as if it were government property even if it has not come into the tax collector\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  That premise finds no basis in standing jurisprudence.  Private bank accounts cannot be equated with the Arizona State Treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that the <em>Flast </em>exception is inapplicable at first may seem in tension with several earlier cases, all addressing Establishment Clause issues and all decided after <em>Flast</em>.  See <em>Mueller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/388/index.html">463 U.

When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither noted nor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect existed. <em> </em>See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hagans</em> v. <em>Lavine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/index.html">415 U.

The Court would risk error if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated and unexamined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit, disadvantages a particular religious group or a particular nonreligious group, the disadvantaged party would not have to rely on <em>Flast </em>to obtain redress for a resulting injury.  See <em>Texas Monthly, Inc.</em> v. <em>Bullock</em>, 489 U. S., at 8 (plurality opinion) (finding standing where a general interest magazine sought to recover tax payments on the ground that religious periodicals were exempt from the tax).  Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can be shown in various ways, it is far from clear that any nonbinding <em>sub silentio</em> holdings in the cases respondents cite would have depended on <em>Flast</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Walz</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 666\xe2\x80\x93667 (explaining that the plaintiff was an \xe2\x80\x9cowner of real estate\xe2\x80\x9d in New York City who objected to the city\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty tax exemptions to religious organizations\xe2\x80\x9d).  That the plaintiffs in those cases could have\nadvanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of <em>Flast</em> makes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether or why standing should have been found where the issue was left unexplored.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real injury to particular individuals, the federal courts may adjudicate the matter.  Like other constitutional provisions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and meaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the context of actual disputes.  That reality underlies the case-or-controversy requirement, a requirement that has not been satisfied here.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to undermine public confidence in the neutrality and integrity of the Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the role of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power to invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees with them.  In an era of frequent litigation, class actions, sweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continuing jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must be more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing, not less so.  Making the Article III standing inquiry all the more necessary are the significant implications of constitutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide applicability that are beyond Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to change.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present suit serves as an illustration of these principles.  The fact that respondents are state taxpayers does not give them standing to challenge the subsidies that \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 allegedly provides to religious STOs.  To alter the rules of standing or weaken their requisite elements would be inconsistent with the case-or-controversy limitation on federal jurisdiction imposed by Article III.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963541">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n563 U.

The Arizona taxpayers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs) allege that the use of these funds to subsidize school tuition organizations (STOs) breaches the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s promise of religious neutrality.  Many of these STOs, the Plaintiffs claim, discriminate on the basis of a child\xe2\x80\x99s religion when awarding scholarships.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For almost half a century, litigants like the Plaintiffs have obtained judicial review of claims that the government has used its taxing and spending power in violation of the Establishment Clause.  Beginning in <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968), and continuing in case after case for over four decades, this Court and others have exercised jurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not materially different from this one.  Not every suit has succeeded on the merits, or should have.  But every taxpayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the government\xe2\x80\x99s financing of religious activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing to hear taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 claims that the government has unconstitutionally subsidized religion through its tax system.  These litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because the funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax credit, rather than an appropriation.  A tax credit, the Court asserts, does not injure objecting taxpayers, because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This novel distinction in standing law between appropriations and tax expenditures has as little basis in principle as it has in our precedent.  Cash grants and targeted tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same government objective\xe2\x80\x94to provide financial support to select individuals or organizations.  Taxpayers who oppose state aid of religion have equal reason to protest whether that aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other.  Either way, the government has financed the religious activity.  And so either way, taxpayers should be able to challenge the subsidy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still worse, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary distinction threatens to eliminate <em>all </em>occasions for a taxpayer to contest the government\xe2\x80\x99s monetary support of religion.  Precisely because appropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical objectives, the government can easily substitute one for the other.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion thus enables the government to end-run <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of access to the Judiciary.  From now on, the government need follow just one simple rule\xe2\x80\x94subsidize through the tax system\xe2\x80\x94to preclude taxpayer challenges to state funding of religion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that result\xe2\x80\x94the effective demise of taxpayer standing\xe2\x80\x94will diminish the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s force and meaning.  Sometimes, no one other than taxpayers has suffered the injury necessary to challenge government sponsorship of religion.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding therefore will prevent federal courts from determining whether some subsidies to sectarian organizations comport with our Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of religious neutrality.  Because I believe these challenges warrant consideration on the merits, I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority recounts, this Court has held that paying taxes usually does not give an individual Article III standing to challenge government action.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  Taxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury because each person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury \xe2\x80\xa6 is comparatively minute and indeterminable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a>, 487 (1923) (decided with <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>).  Given the size and complexity of government budgets, it is a \xe2\x80\x9cfiction\xe2\x80\x9d to contend that an unlawful expenditure causes an individual \xe2\x80\x9cany measurable economic harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hein</em> v. <em>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/587/index.html">551 U. S. 587</a>, 593 (2007) (plurality opinion).  Nor can taxpayers in the ordinary case establish causation (<em>i.e.,</em> that the disputed government measure affects their tax burden) or redressability (<em>i.e., </em>that a judicial remedy would result in tax reductions).  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  On these points, all agree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disagreement concerns their relevance here.  This case is not about the general prohibition on taxpayer standing, and cannot be resolved on that basis.  This case is instead about the exception to the rule\xe2\x80\x94the principle established decades ago in <em>Flast </em>that taxpayers <em>may</em> challenge certain government actions alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.  The Plaintiffs have standing if their suit meets <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements\xe2\x80\x94and it does so under any fair reading of that decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taxpayers have standing, <em>Flast</em> held, when they allege that a statute enacted pursuant to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s taxing and spending power violates the Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  In this situation, the Court explained, a plaintiff can establish a two-part nexus \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 102.  First, by challenging legislative action taken under the taxing and spending clause, the taxpayer shows \xe2\x80\x9ca logical link between [her] status and the type of \xe2\x80\xa6 enactment attacked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, by invoking the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x94a specific limitation on the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s taxing and spending power\xe2\x80\x94the taxpayer demonstrates \xe2\x80\x9ca nexus between [her] status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because of these connections, <em>Flast </em>held, taxpayers alleging that the government is using tax proceeds to aid religion have \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessary stake \xe2\x80\xa6 in the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>They are \xe2\x80\x9cproper and appropriate part[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indeed, often the only possible parties\xe2\x80\x94to seek judicial enforcement of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of religious neutrality.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That simple restatement of the <em>Flast </em>standard should be enough to establish that the Plaintiffs have standing.  They attack a provision of the Arizona tax code that the legislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s taxing and spending clause (<em>Flast </em>nexus, part 1).  And they allege that this provision violates the Establishment Clause (<em>Flast </em>nexus, part 2).  By satisfying both of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their \xe2\x80\x9cstake as taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d in enforcing constitutional restraints on the provision of aid to STOs.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Indeed, the connection in this case between \xe2\x80\x9cthe [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> could not be any tighter: As noted when this Court previously addressed a different issue in this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs invoke the Establishment Clause to challenge \xe2\x80\x9can integral part of the State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>tax</em> statute\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cis reflected on state <em>tax</em> forms\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cis part of the calculus necessary to determine <em>tax</em> liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a>, 119 (2004) <em>(Winn I)</em> (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).  Finding standing here is merely a matter of applying <em>Flast</em>.  I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination (not questioned even by the eight judges who called for rehearing en banc on the merits) that the Plaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguishing between two methods of financing religion: A taxpayer has standing to challenge state subsidies to religion, the Court announces, when the mechanism used is an appropriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax break, otherwise called a \xe2\x80\x9ctax expenditure.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the former case, but not in the latter, the Court declares, the taxpayer suffers cognizable injury.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this distinction finds no support in case law, and just as little in reason.  In the decades since <em>Flast</em>, no court\xe2\x80\x94not one\xe2\x80\x94has differentiated between appropriations and tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have standing.  Over and over again, courts (including this one) have faced Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits, deductions, and exemptions; over and over again, these courts have reached the merits of these claims.  And that is for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same injury for standing purposes whether government subsidization of religion takes the form of a cash grant or a tax measure.  The only rationale the majority offers for its newfound distinction\xe2\x80\x94that grants, but not tax expenditures, somehow come from a complaining taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s own wallet\xe2\x80\x94cannot bear the weight the Court places on it.  If <em>Flast </em>is still good law\xe2\x80\x94and the majority today says nothing to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94then the Plaintiffs should be able to pursue their claim on the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that litigants in the same shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing under <em>Flast</em>.  To the contrary: We have faced the identical situation five times\xe2\x80\x94including in a prior incarnation of this very case!\xe2\x80\x94and we have five times resolved the suit without questioning the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 standing.  Lower federal courts have followed our example and handled the matter in the same way.  I count 14 separate cases (involving 20 appellate and district courts) that adjudicated taxpayer challenges to tax expenditures alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  I suspect I have missed a few.  I have not found any instance of a court dismissing such a claim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the five cases in which this Court entertained suits filed by taxpayers alleging that tax expenditures unlawfully subsidized religion.  We first took up such a challenge in <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U. S. 664</a>, 666\xe2\x80\x93667 (1970), where we upheld the constitutionality of a property tax exemption for religious organizations.  Next, in <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>McNair</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/734/index.html">413 U. S. 734</a>, 735\xe2\x80\x93736, 738\xe2\x80\x93739 (1973), we decided that the Establishment Clause permitted a state agency to issue tax-exempt bonds to sectarian institutions.  The same day, in <em>Committee for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty</em> v. <em>Nyquist</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/index.html">413 U. S. 756</a>, 789\xe2\x80\x93794 (1973), we struck down a state tax deduction for parents who paid tuition at religious and other private schools.  A decade later, in <em>Mueller</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/388/index.html">463 U. S. 388</a>, 390\xe2\x80\x93391 (1983), we considered, but this time rejected, a similar Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax deduction for expenses incurred in attending such schools.  And most recently, we decided a preliminary issue <em>in this very case</em>, ruling that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, posed no barrier to the Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 litigation of their Establishment Clause claim.  See <em>Winn I</em>, 542 U. S., at 112.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court in all five of these cases divided sharply on the merits of the disputes.  But in one respect, the Justices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to question the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 standing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General, participating here as <em>amicus curiae</em>, conceded at oral argument that under the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and now the Court\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94view of taxpayer standing, each of these five cases should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[The Court:]  So if you are right, \xe2\x80\xa6 the Court was without authority to decide <em>Walz</em>, <em>Nyquist</em>, <em>Hunt</em>, <em>Mueller</em>, [and] <em>Hibbs </em>[v. <em>Winn</em>,] this very case, just a few years ago?\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n[Solicitor General:]  Right\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [M]y answer to you is yes.</p>\n<p>\n\n[The Court:]  I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the\xe2\x80\x94you said the answer is yes.  In other words, you agree \xe2\x80\xa6 those cases were wrongly decided\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [Y]ou would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n[Solicitor General:]  No taxpayer standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\nNor could the Solicitor General have answered differently.  Each of these suits, as described above, alleged that a state tax expenditure violated the Establishment Clause.  And each relied <em>only </em>on taxpayer standing as the basis for federal-court review.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court today speculates that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiffs in those cases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of <em>Flast</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  But whatever could have been, in fact not one of them did so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Court itself understood the basis of standing in these five cases.  This and every federal court has an independent obligation to consider standing, even when the parties do not call it into question.  See, <em>e.g., FW/PBS, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dallas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/215/index.html">493 U. S. 215</a>, 230\xe2\x80\x93231 (1990).  To do anything else would risk an unlawful exercise of judicial authority.  And in these cases the Court had an additional prompt: In several of them, <em>amici</em>, including the United States, contested\xe2\x80\x94or at least raised as a question\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 standing as taxpayers to pursue their claims.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court, moreover, was well aware at the time of the issues presented by taxpayer standing.  We decided three of the cases within a year of elaborating the general bar on taxpayer suits, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v.<em> Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/index.html">418 U. S. 166</a> (1974);<em> Schlesinger </em>v.<em> Reservists Comm. to Stop the War</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/index.html">418 U. S. 208</a> (1974), and the fourth just after we held that bar applicable to a different kind of Establishment Clause claim, see <em>Valley Forge Christian College</em> v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/index.html">454 U. S. 464</a> (1982).  Indeed, the decisions on their face reflect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of what gave the plaintiffs standing; in each, we specifically described the plaintiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the tax system to fund religious activities.  See <em>Winn I</em>, 542 U. S., at 94; <em>Mueller</em>, 463 U. S., at 392; <em>Nyquist</em>, 413 U. S., at 759, 762; <em>Hunt</em>, 413 U. S., at 735\xe2\x80\x93736; <em>Walz</em>, 397 U. S., at 666\xe2\x80\x93667.  In short, we considered and decided all these cases because we thought taxpayer standing existed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority shrugs off these decisions because they did not discuss what was taken as obvious.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  But we have previously stressed that the Court should not \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for over 40 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown Shoe Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/294/index.html">370 U. S. 294</a>, 307 (1962); see <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 619 (1988) (finding standing partly because the Court, in deciding similar cases, had \xe2\x80\x9cnot questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bank of United States</em> v. <em>Deveaux</em>, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (prior decisions exercising but not discussing jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9chave much weight, as they show that [a jurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the bar or the bench\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that principle has extra force here, because we have relied on some of these decisions to support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction in other cases.  Pause on that for a moment: The very decisions the majority today so easily dismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of<font b="1"> jurisdiction.  So in <em>School Dist. of Grand Rapids</em> v. <em>Ball</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/373/index.html">473 U. S. 373</a> (1985), we relied on <em>Nyquist </em>and <em>Hunt </em>to conclude that taxpayers had standing to challenge a program of aid to religious and other private schools.  473 U. S., at 380, n. 5, overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Agostini</em> v. <em>Felton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/203/index.html">521 U. S. 203</a> (1997).  And in <em>Winn I</em> (recall, an earlier iteration of this case), we rejected a different jurisdictional objection in part by relying on <em>Mueller</em> and <em>Nyquist</em>.  We called those cases \xe2\x80\x9cadjudications of great moment discerning no [jurisdictional] barrier\xe2\x80\x9d and warned that they could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe written off as reflecting nothing more than unexamined custom or unthinking habit.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at 112, n. 13 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Until today, that is\xe2\x80\x94when the majority does write off these adjudications and reaches a result against all precedent.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our taxpayer standing cases have declined to distinguish between appropriations and tax expenditures for a simple reason: Here, as in many contexts, the distinction is one in search of a difference.  To begin to see why, consider an example far afield from <em>Flast </em>and, indeed, from religion.  Imagine that the Federal Government decides it should pay hundreds of billions of dollars to insolvent banks in the midst of a financial crisis.  Suppose, too, that many millions of taxpayers oppose this bailout on the ground (whether right or wrong is immaterial) that it uses their hard-earned money to reward irresponsible business behavior.  In the face of this hostility, some Members of Congress make the following proposal: Rather than give the money to banks via appropriations, the Government will allow banks to subtract the exact same amount from the tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U. S. Treasury.  Would this proposal calm the furor?  Or would most taxpayers respond by saying that a subsidy is a subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether accomplished by the one means or by the other?  Surely the latter; indeed, we would think the less of our countrymen if they failed to see through this cynical proposal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law also recognizes\xe2\x80\x94that targeted tax breaks are often \xe2\x80\x9ceconomically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 859 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring).  Tax credits, deductions, and exemptions provided to an individual or organization have \xe2\x80\x9cmuch the same effect as a cash grant to the [recipient] of the amount of tax it would have to pay\xe2\x80\x9d absent the tax break.  <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Wash.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/index.html">461 U. S. 540</a>, 544 (1983).  \xe2\x80\x9cOur opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, \xe2\x80\x9chave long recognized \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0the reality that [tax expenditures] are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arkansas Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Project, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ragland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/221/index.html">481 U. S. 221</a>, 236 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Or again: Tax breaks \xe2\x80\x9ccan be viewed as a form of government spending,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</em> v. <em>Town of Harrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/564/index.html">520 U. S. 564</a>, 589\xe2\x80\x93590, n. 22 (1997), even assuming the diverted tax funds do not pass through the public treasury.  And once more: Both special tax benefits and cash grants \xe2\x80\x9crepresen[t] a charge made upon the state,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nyquist</em>, 413 U. S., at 790\xe2\x80\x93791 (internal quotation marks omitted); both deplete funds in the government\xe2\x80\x99s coffers by transferring money to select recipients.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For just this reason, government budgeting rules routinely insist on calculation of tax subsidies, in addition to appropriations.  The President must provide information on the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget\nhe submits to Congress each year.  See 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105(a)(16); n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  Similarly, congressional budget committees must report to all Members on the level of\ntax expenditures in the federal budget.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7632(e)(2)(E).  Many States\xe2\x80\x94including Arizona\xe2\x80\x94likewise compute the impact of targeted tax breaks on the public treasury, in recognition that these measures are just spending under a different name, see n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  The Arizona Department of Revenue must issue an annual report \xe2\x80\x9cdetailing the approximate costs in lost revenue for all state tax expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa742\xe2\x80\x931005(A)(4) (West 2006).  The most recent report notes the significance of this accounting in the budget process.  It explains that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fiscal impact of implementing\xe2\x80\x9d targeted tax breaks, including the STO credit challenged here, is \xe2\x80\x9csimilar to a direct expenditure of state funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizona Dept. of Revenue, Revenue Impact of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Tax Expenditures FY 2009/10, p. 1 (preliminary Nov. 15, 2010); see also Surrey, Tax Incentives as a Device for Implementing Government Policy: A Comparison with Direct Government Expenditures, 83 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 705, 717 (1970) (\xe2\x80\x9cA dollar is a dollar\xe2\x80\x94both for the person who receives it and the government that pays it, whether the dollar comes with a tax credit label or a direct expenditure label\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And because these financing mechanisms result in the same bottom line, taxpayers challenging them can allege the same harm.  Our prior cases have often recognized the cost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers generally.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Government grants exemptions or allows deductions\xe2\x80\x9d to some, we have observed, \xe2\x80\x9call taxpayers are affected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction \xe2\x80\xa6 means that other taxpayers can be said to be indirect and vicarious \xe2\x80\x98donors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/index.html">461 U. S. 574</a>, 591 (1983).  And again: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery tax exemption constitutes a subsidy that affects nonqualifying taxpayers, forcing them to\xe2\x80\x9d bear its cost.  <em>Texas Monthly, Inc.</em> v. <em>Bullock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/1/index.html">489 U. S. 1</a>, 14 (1989) (plurality opinion).  Indeed, we have specifically compared the harm arising from a tax subsidy with that arising from a cash grant, and declared those injuries equivalent because both kinds of support deplete the public fisc.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn either case,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe alleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/547/332/index.html">547 U. S. 332</a>, 344 (2006).  This taxpayer injury of course fails to establish standing in the mine-run case, whatever form the state aid takes.  See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 343\xe2\x80\x93344; <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310; <em>supra, </em>at 3.  But the key is this: Whenever taxpayers have standing under <em>Flast </em>to challenge an appropriation, they should also have standing to contest a tax expenditure.  Their access to the federal courts should not depend on which type of financial subsidy the State has offered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider some further examples of the point, but this time concerning state funding of religion.  Suppose a State desires to reward Jews\xe2\x80\x94by, say, $500 per year\xe2\x80\x94for their religious devotion.  Should the nature of taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 concern vary if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their tax returns, in lieu of receiving an annual stipend?  Or assume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of crucifixes.  It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and distribute them to all takers.  Or it could mail a reimbursement check to any individual who buys her own and submits a receipt for the purchase.  Or it could authorize that person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she paid.  Now, really\xe2\x80\x94do taxpayers have less reason to complain if the State selects the last of these three options?  The Court today says they do, but that is wrong.  The effect of each form of subsidy is the same, on the public fisc and on those who contribute to it.  Regardless of which mechanism the State uses, taxpayers have an identical stake in ensuring that the State\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its taxing and spending power complies with the Constitution.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to aid school tuition organizations.  Each year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans: Either pay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or subtract up to $500 from your tax bill by contributing that sum to an STO.  See <em>Winn I</em>, 542 U. S., at 95.  To claim the credit, an individual makes a notation on her tax return and splits her tax payment into two checks, one made out to the State and the other to the STO.  As this Court recognized in <em>Winn I</em>, the STO payment is therefore \xe2\x80\x9ccostless\xe2\x80\x9d to the individual, <em>ibid.;</em> it comes out of what she otherwise would be legally obligated to pay the State\xe2\x80\x94hence, out of public resources.  And STOs capitalize on this aspect of the tax credit for all it is worth\xe2\x80\x94which is quite a lot.  To drum up support, STOs highlight that \xe2\x80\x9cdonations\xe2\x80\x9d are made not with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own, but with other people\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94money.  One STO advertises that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s scholarship tax credit, you can send children to our community\xe2\x80\x99s [religious] day schools and it won\xe2\x80\x99t cost you a dime!\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 13 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  Another urges potential donors to \xe2\x80\x9cimagine giving [to charity] with someone else\xe2\x80\x99s money\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Stop Imagining, thanks to Arizona tax laws you can!\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 14 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  And so Arizonans do just that: It is, after all, good fun to spend other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.  By the State\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning, from 1998 to 2008 the credit cost Arizona almost $350 million in redirected tax revenue.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Plaintiffs contend that this expenditure violates the Establishment Clause.  If the legislature had appropriated these monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would have standing, beyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in federal court.  But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse, the Court today holds, because Arizona funds STOs through a tax credit rather than a cash grant.  No less than in the hypothetical examples offered above, here too form prevails over substance, and differences that make no difference determine access to the Judiciary.  And the casualty is a historic and vital method of enforcing the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of religious neutrality.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority offers just one reason to distinguish appropriations and tax expenditures: A taxpayer experiences injury, the Court asserts, only when the government \xe2\x80\x9cextracts and spends\xe2\x80\x9d her very own tax dollars to aid religion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  In other words, a taxpayer suffers legally cognizable harm if but only if her particular tax dollars wind up in a religious organization\xe2\x80\x99s coffers.  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 (Solicitor General proposing that the \xe2\x80\x9ckey point\xe2\x80\x9d was: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [Plaintiffs] pay in tax,\xe2\x80\x9d none goes to religious STOs).  And no taxpayer can make this showing, the Court concludes, if the government subsidizes religion through tax credits, deductions, or exemptions (rather than through appropriations).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority purports to rely on <em>Flast </em>to support this new \xe2\x80\x9cextraction\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  It plucks the three words \xe2\x80\x9cextrac[t] and spen[d]\xe2\x80\x9d from the midst of the <em>Flast </em>opinion, and suggests that they severely constrict the decision\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (quoting 392 U. S., at 106).  And it notes that <em>Flast </em>partly relied on James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s famed argument in the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)); see <em>ante, </em>at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  And that is all the majority can come up with.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But as indicated earlier, everything of import in <em>Flast </em>cuts against the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Here is how <em>Flast</em> stated its holding: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e hold that a taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\xe2\x80\x9d the Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  Nothing in that straightforward sentence supports the idea that a taxpayer can challenge only legislative action that disburses his particular contribution to the state treasury.  And here is how <em>Flast </em>primarily justified its holding: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 103.  That evil arises even if the specific dollars that the government uses do not come from citizens who object to the preference.  Likewise, the two-part nexus test, which is the heart of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s doctrinal analysis, contains no hint of an extraction requirement.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  And finally, James Madison provides no comfort to today\xe2\x80\x99s majority.  He referred to \xe2\x80\x9cthree pence\xe2\x80\x9d exactly because it was, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as today, the core injury of a religious establishment had naught to do with any given individual\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-pocket loss.  See <em>infra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9323 (further discussing Madison\xe2\x80\x99s views).  So the majority is left with nothing, save for three words <em>Flast </em>used to describe the particular facts in that case: In not a single non-trivial respect could the <em>Flast </em>Court recognize its handiwork in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s depiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The injury to taxpayers that <em>Flast </em>perceived arose whenever the legislature used its taxing-and-spending power to channel tax dollars to religious activities.  In that and subsequent cases (including the five in this Court involving tax expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requisite harm by stating that public resources were funding religion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celectronic tag\xe2\x80\x9d or other means) did not enter into the question.  See <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em>, 547 U. S., at 348 (describing how the <em>Flast </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s history led the Court to view the alleged \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d as the expenditure of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tax money\xe2\x80\x99 in aid of religion\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Flast</em>, 392 U. S., at 106)).  And for all the reasons already given, that standard is met regardless whether the funding is provided via cash grant or tax expenditure.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  Taxpayers pick up the cost of the subsidy in either form.  See <em>ibid</em>.  So taxpayers have an interest in preventing the use of either mechanism to infringe religious neutrality.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s new conception of injury is at odds not merely with <em>Flast</em>, but also (if ironically) with our cases precluding taxpayer standing generally.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3; <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s majority insists that legislation challenged under the Establishment Clause must \xe2\x80\x9cextrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  But we have rejected taxpayer standing in other contexts because each taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s share of treasury funds is \xe2\x80\x9cminute and indeterminable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frothingham</em>, 262 U. S., at 487.  No taxpayer can point to an expenditure (by cash grant or otherwise) and say that her own tax dollars are in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is,\xe2\x80\x9d as we have noted, \xe2\x80\x9ca complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional \xe2\x80\xa6 expenditure causes an individual \xe2\x80\xa6 taxpayer any measurable economic harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hein</em>, 551 U. S., at 593 (plurality opinion).  That is as true in Establishment Clause cases as in any others.  Taxpayers have standing in these cases <em>despite</em> their foreseeable failure to show that the alleged constitutional violation involves their own tax dollars, not <em>because</em> the State has used their particular funds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And something still deeper is wrong with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cextract and spend\xe2\x80\x9d requirement: It does not measure what matters under the Establishment Clause.  Let us indulge the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fiction that a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c.000000000001 penny\xe2\x80\x9d is somehow involved in an ordinary appropriation of public funds for religious activity (thus supposedly distinguishing it from a tax expenditure).  Still, consider the following example: Imagine the Internal Revenue Service places a checkbox on tax returns asking filers if they object to the government using their taxes to aid religion.  If the government keeps \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d money separate from \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d money and subsidizes religious activities only from the nonobjectors\xe2\x80\x99 account, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suggests that no taxpayer would have standing to allege a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The funds used, after all, would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cextracted from a citizen and handed to a religious institution in violation of the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  But this Court has never indicated that States may insulate subsidies to religious organizations from legal challenge by eliciting the consent of some taxpayers.  And the Court has of course been right not to take this approach.  Taxpayers incur the same harm, and should have the same ability to bring suit, whether the government stores tax funds in one bank account or two.  None of the principles underlying the Establishment Clause suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James Madison, whom the Court again rightly labels \xe2\x80\x9cthe leading architect of the religion clauses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (quoting <em>Flast</em>, 392 U. S., at 103; internal quotation marks omitted), had something important to say about the matter of \xe2\x80\x9cextraction.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the majority notes, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial and Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed in Virginia to aid teachers of the Christian religion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But Madison\xe2\x80\x99s passionate opposition to that proposal informs this case in a manner different than the majority suggests.  The Virginia tax in fact would not have extracted any monies (not even \xe2\x80\x9cthree pence\xe2\x80\x9d) from unwilling citizens, as the Court now requires.  The plan allowed conscientious objectors to opt out of subsidizing religion by contributing their assessment to an alternative fund for the construction and maintenance of county schools.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  See A Bill Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion, reprinted in <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/330/1/index.html">330 U.

The government, after all, often uses tax expenditures to subsidize favored persons and activities.  Still more, the government almost <em>always</em> has this option.  Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily interchangeable; what is a cash grant today can be a tax break tomorrow.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion thus offers a roadmap\xe2\x80\x94more truly, just a one-step instruction\xe2\x80\x94to any government that wishes to insulate its financing of religious activity from legal challenge.  Structure the funding as a tax expenditure, and <em>Flast </em>will not stand in the way.  No taxpayer will have standing to object.  However blatantly the government may violate the Establishment Clause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And by ravaging <em>Flast </em>in this way, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision damages one of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s defining constitutional commitments.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ten simple words that have stood for over 200 years as a foundation stone of American religious liberty.  Ten words that this Court has long understood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no means eliminate) the government\xe2\x80\x99s power to finance religious activity.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling today will not shield all state subsidies for religion from review; as the Court notes, some persons alleging Establishment Clause violations have suffered individualized injuries, and therefore have standing, independent of their taxpayer status.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 17\xe2\x80\x9318.

Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s tuition-tax-credit program in fact necessitates the direct expenditure of funds from the state treasury.  After all, the statute establishing the initiative requires the Arizona Department of Revenue to certify STOs, maintain an STO registry, make the registry available to the public on request and post it on a website, collect annual reports filed by STOs, and send written notice to STOs that have failed to comply with statutory requirements.

Thus, on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own theory, the government has \xe2\x80\x9cextract[ed] and spen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 (along with other taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99) dollars to implement the challenged program, and the Plaintiffs should have standing.  (The majority, after all, makes clear that nothing in its analysis hinges on the size or proportion of the Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 contribution.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.)  But applying the majority\xe2\x80\x99s theory in this way reveals the hollowness at its core.  Can anyone believe that the Plaintiffs have suffered injury through the costs involved in administering the program, but not through the far greater costs of granting the tax expenditure in the first place?</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0On this traditional view of the harm to taxpayers arising from state financing of religion, the Plaintiffs here can satisfy not only Article III\xe2\x80\x99s injury requirement, but also its causation and redressability requirements.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary position, <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, stems from its miscasting of the injury involved; once that harm is stated correctly, all the rest follows.  To wit: The Plaintiffs allege they suffer <em>injury</em> when the State funnels public resources to religious organizations through the tax credit.  Arizona, they claim, has <em>caused</em> this injury by enacting legislation that establishes the credit.  And an injunction limiting the credit\xe2\x80\x99s operation would <em>redress</em> the harm by preventing the allegedly unlawful diversion of tax revenues.  The Plaintiffs need not, as the majority insists, show that this remedy would \xe2\x80\x9caffect \xe2\x80\xa6 their tax payments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, any more than the taxpayer in <em>Flast</em> had to establish that her tax burden would decrease absent the Government\xe2\x80\x99s funding of religious schools.
