Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state security forces during Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s 1976\xe2\x80\x931983 \xe2\x80\x9cDirty War\xe2\x80\x9d to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs.  Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California and Argentina law.  Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey.  MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including California.  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.  Opposing that motion, plaintiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA.  The District Court granted Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  Reversing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, the Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the California courts\xe2\x80\x99 all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cagent\xe2\x80\x9d for jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be answerable to suit in that State.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries allegedly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside the United States.

See Pennoyer v. Neff,\n\n95 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714\n.  That rigidly territorial focus eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Washington,\n\n326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310\n.  International Shoe presaged the recognition of two personal jurisdiction categories:  One category, today called \xe2\x80\x9cspecific jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit \xe2\x80\x9carise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum,\xe2\x80\x9d Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Hall,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408\n, n.\xc2\xa08.  International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific, case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d exercisable when a foreign corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Since International Shoe, \xe2\x80\x9cspecific jurisdiction has become the centerpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Goodyear, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.  See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., \n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437\n, Helicopteros, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  As is evident from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdiction has been cut loose from Pennoyer\xe2\x80\x99s sway, general jurisdiction has not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized.

The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s agency determination rested primarily on its observation that MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s services were \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical readiness to perform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.  But if \xe2\x80\x9cimportan[ce]\xe2\x80\x9d in this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond even the \xe2\x80\x9csprawling view of general jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d rejected in Goodyear.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (2)\xc2\xa0Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and that MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California.  The paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s place of incorporation and principal place of business.  Goodyear, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, however, would reach well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cengages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 16\xe2\x80\x9317, and nn.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.  The words \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic,\xe2\x80\x9d plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction would be appropriate.  See 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317.  With respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead of \xe2\x80\x9cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 318.  Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has explained, is whether a foreign corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caffiliations with the State are so \xe2\x80\x98continuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x99 as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Goodyear, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor does either entity have its principal place of business there.  If Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s sales are sizable.  No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general jurisdiction so grasping.  The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts attributed to it, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred or had its principal impact in California.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims.  See Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.

The litigation commenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] a German public stock company, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.  The complaint alleged that during Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s 1976\xe2\x80\x931983 \xe2\x80\x9cDirty War,\xe2\x80\x9d Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs.  Damages for the alleged human-rights violations were sought from Daimler under the laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.  Jurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),a subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware withits principal place of business in New Jersey.  MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independ-ent dealerships throughout the United States, including California.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The question presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment precludes the District Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in this case, given the absence of any California connectionto the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the complaint.  Plaintiffs invoked the court\xe2\x80\x99s general or all-purpose jurisdiction.  California, they urge, is a place where Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against it, wherever in the world the claims may arise.  For example, as plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 counsel affirmed, under the proffered jurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle overturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passenger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit in California.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Exercises of personal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by due process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory authority.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between general or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-linked jurisdiction.  As to the former, we held that a court may assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation \xe2\x80\x9cto hear any and all claims against [it]\xe2\x80\x9d only when the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s affiliations with the State in which suit is brought areso constant and pervasive \xe2\x80\x9cas to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  Instructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries plaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in Argentina.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with Argentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the military dictatorship in place there from 1976 through 1983, a period known as Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDirty War.\xe2\x80\x9d  Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,\n\n106Stat.\n73, note following\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, as well as claims for wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws of California and Argentina.  The incidents recounted in the complaint center on MB Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s plant in Gonzalez Catan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s alleged col-laboration with Argentinian authorities took place in Cali-fornia or anywhere else in the United States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 operative complaint names only one corporate defendant: Daimler, the petitioner here.  Plaintiffs seek to hold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s alleged malfeasance.  Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft (public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in Stuttgart.  At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina was a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor in interest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.  Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted declarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the presence of Daimler itself in California.  Alternatively, plaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a distinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should be treated as Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s agent for jurisdictional purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Delaware limited liability corporation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  MBUSA serves as Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive importer and distributor in the United States, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from Daimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and ultimately distributing them to independent dealerships located throughout the Nation.  Although MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s principal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has multiple California-based facilities, including a regional office in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in Carson, and a Classic Center in Irvine.  According to the record developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of luxury vehicles to the California market.  In particular, over 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States take place in California, and MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s California sales account for 2.4% of Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s worldwide sales.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delineated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets forth requirements for MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States.  That agreementestablished MBUSA as an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contracto[r]\xe2\x80\x9dthat \xe2\x80\x9cbuy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as an independent business for [its] own account.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 179a.

Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s own affiliations with California, the court first determined, were insufficient to support the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the corporation.  Bauman v.

The defendant in Perkins, Benguet, was a company incorporated under the laws of the Philippines, where it operated gold and silver mines.  Benguet ceased its mining operations during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II; its president moved to Ohio, where he kept an office, maintained the company\xe2\x80\x99s files, and oversaw the company\xe2\x80\x99s activities.

Four U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens perished in that accident; their survivors and representatives brought suit in Texas state court against the helicopter\xe2\x80\x99s owner and operator, a Colombian corporation.  That company\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with Texas were confined to \xe2\x80\x9csending its chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas-based helicopter company] for substantial sums; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 416.

That case arose from a bus accident outside Paris that killed two boys from North Carolina.  The boys\xe2\x80\x99 parents brought a wrongful-death suit in North Carolina state court alleging that the bus\xe2\x80\x99s tire was defectively manufactured.  The complaint named as defendants not only The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear), an Ohio corporation, but also Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s Turkish, French, and Luxembourgian subsidiaries.  Those foreign subsidiaries, which manufactured tires for sale in Europe and Asia, lacked any affiliation with North Caro-lina.  A small percentage of tires manufactured by the foreign subsidiaries were distributed in North Carolina, however, and on that ground, the North Carolina Court of Appeals held the subsidiaries amenable to the general jurisdiction of North Carolina courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We reversed, observing that the North Carolina court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis \xe2\x80\x9celided the essential difference between case-specific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Although the placement of a product into the stream of commerce \xe2\x80\x9cmay bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, such contacts \xe2\x80\x9cdo not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311).  As International Shoe itself teaches, a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous activity of some sorts within a state is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318.  Because Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s foreign subsidiaries were \xe2\x80\x9cin no sense at home in North Carolina,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, those subsidiaries could not be required to submit to the general jurisdiction of that State\xe2\x80\x99s courts.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).

In the proceedings below, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain points we now take as given.  Plaintiffs have never attempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction category.  Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s own contacts with California were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction.  While plaintiffs ultimately persuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s California contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point have they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of Daimler.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that the California courts could exercise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  But see Brief for Petitioner 23, n.\xc2\xa04 (suggestion that in light of Goodyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction in California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n.\xc2\xa05 (hereinafter U.\xc2\xa0S.

The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s agency analysis derived from Circuit precedent consideringprincipally whether the subsidiary \xe2\x80\x9cperforms services that are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them, the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services.\xe2\x80\x9d  644 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 920 (quoting Doe v. Unocal Corp., 248 F.\xc2\xa03d 915, 928 (CA9 2001); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This Court has not yet addressed whether a foreign corporation may be subjected to a court\xe2\x80\x99s general jurisdiction based on the contacts of its in-state subsidiary.  Daimler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a subsidiary\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its parent only when the former is so dominated by the latter as to be its alter ego.  The Ninth Circuit adopted a less rigorous test based on what it described as an \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d relationship.  Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and shapes: \xe2\x80\x9cOne may be an agent for some business purposes and not others so that the fact that one may be an agent for one purpose does not make him or her an agent for every purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A C. J. S., Agency \xc2\xa743, p. 367 (2013) (footnote omitted).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]  A subsidiary, for example, might be its parent\xe2\x80\x99s agent for claims arising in the place where the subsidiary operates, yet not its agent regarding claims arising elsewhere.  The Court of Appeals did not advert to that prospect.  But we need not pass judgment on invocation of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdiction, for in no event can the appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis be sustained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s agency finding rested primarily on its observation that MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s services were \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical readiness to perform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.  Formulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks the deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer: \xe2\x80\x9cAnything a corporation does through an independent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably something that the corporation would do \xe2\x80\x98by other means\xe2\x80\x99 if the independent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  676 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 777 (O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s agency theory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to general jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond even the \xe2\x80\x9csprawling view of general jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d we rejected in Goodyear.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if we were to assume that MBUSA is at home in California, and further to assume MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California, for Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s slim contacts with the State hardly render it at home there.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Goodyear made clear that only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual\xe2\x80\x99s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (citing Brilmayer et\xc2\xa0al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 721, 728 (1988)).

The Court of Appeals emphasized, as supportive of the exercise of general jurisdiction, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS),\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA),\n\n106Stat.\n73, note following\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.

Recent decisions of this Court, however, have rendered plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ATS and TVPA claims infirm.  See Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (presumption against extra-territorial application controls claims under the ATS); Mohamad v.

Other nations do not share the uninhibited approach to personal jurisdiction advanced by the Court of Appeals in this case.

I concur only in the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the path the Court takes to arrive at that result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court acknowledges that Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s wholly owned subsidiary, has considerable contacts with California.  It has multiple facilities in the State, including a regional headquarters.  Each year, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars, the sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year this suit was brought.  And it provides service and sales support to customers throughout the State.  Daimler has conceded that California courts may exercise general jurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts, and the Court assumes that MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts may be attributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether Daimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction over Daimler?  The Court holds that they are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process jurisprudence.  The problem, the Court says, is not that Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with California are too few, but that its contacts with other forums are too many.  In other words, the Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple offices, the direct distribution of thousands of products accounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous interaction with customers throughout a State would be enough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over some businesses.  Daimler is just not one of those businesses, the Court concludes, because its California contacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide and worldwide\xe2\x80\x9d operations.  Ante, at 21, n.\xc2\xa020.  In recent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the concept of multinational corporations that are supposedly \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d; today the Court deems Daimler \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big for general jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both process and substance.  As to process, the Court decides this case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed on below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a footnote to its brief.  Brief for Petitioner 31\xe2\x80\x9332, n.\xc2\xa05.  Asto substance, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s operations out-side of California ignores the lodestar of our personal jurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defendant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently taken advantage of the State\xe2\x80\x99s laws and protections through its contacts in the State; whether the defendant has contacts elsewhere is immaterial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Regrettably, these errors are unforced.  The Court can and should decide this case on the far simpler ground that, no matter how extensive Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with California, that State\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs suing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and given that a more appropriate forum is available.  Because I would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I concur in the judgment only.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I begin with the point on which the majority and I agree: The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our personal jurisdiction precedents call for a two-part analysis.  The contacts prong asks whether the defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum State to support personal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks whether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable under the circumstances.  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462\n\xe2\x80\x93478 (1985).  As the majority points out, all of the cases in which we have applied the reasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to general jurisdiction.  Ante, at 21, n. 20.  Whether the reasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdiction context is therefore a question we have never decided,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] and it is one on which I can appreciate the arguments on both sides.  But it would be imprudent to decide that question in this case given that respondents have failed to argue against the application of the reasonableness prong during the entire 8-year history of this litigation.  See Brief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application of the reasonableness inquiry); Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Opposition to Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Motion to Quash Service of Process and to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9300194\xe2\x80\x93RMW (ND Cal., May 16, 2005), pp. 14\xe2\x80\x9323 (same).  As a result, I would decide this case under the reasonableness prong without foreclosing future consideration of whether that prong should be limited to the specific jurisdiction context.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We identified the factors that bear on reasonableness in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 102 (1987)\n: \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden on the defendant, the interests of the forum State,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s interest in obtaining relief\xe2\x80\x9d in the forum State, and the interests of other sovereigns in resolving the dispute.  Id., at 113\xe2\x80\x93114.  We held in Asahi that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable and unfair\xe2\x80\x9d for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a claim between a Taiwanese plaintiff and a Japanese defendant that arose out of a transaction in Taiwan, particularly where the Taiwanese plaintiff had not shown that it would be more convenient to litigate in California than in Taiwan or Japan.  Id., at 114. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The same considerations resolve this case.  It involves Argentine plaintiffs suing a German defendant for conduct that took place in Argentina.  Like the plaintiffs in Asahi, respondents have failed to show that it would be more convenient to litigate in California than in Germany, a sovereign with a far greater interest in resolving the dispute.  Asahi thus makes clear that it would be unreasonable for a court in California to subject Daimler to its jurisdiction.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority evidently agrees that, if the reasonableness prong were to apply, it would be unreasonable for California courts to exercise jurisdiction over Daimler in this case.  See ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (noting that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cexor-bitant\xe2\x80\x9d for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction over Daimler, a German defendant, in this \xe2\x80\x9cArgentina-rooted case\xe2\x80\x9d brought by \xe2\x80\x9cforeign plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d).  But instead of resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the majority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued nor decided below.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We generally do not pass on arguments that lower courts have not addressed.  See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709,\n718, n.\n7 (2005)\n.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a court of review, not of first view.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This principle carries even greater force where the argument at issue was never pressed below.  See Glover v. United States,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198,\n205 (2001)\n.  Yet the majority disregards this principle, basing its decision on an argument raised for the first time in a footnote of Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s merits brief before this Court.  Brief for Petitioner 32, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven if MBUSA were a division of Daimler AG rather than a separate corporation, Daimler AG would still . . . not be \xe2\x80\x98at home\xe2\x80\x99 in California\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision is troubling all the more because the parties were not asked to brief this issue.  We granted certiorari on the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it violates due process for a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based solely on the fact that an indirect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of the defendant in the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  At no point in Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari did the company contend that, even if this attribution question were de-cided against it, its contacts in California would still be in-sufficient to support general jurisdiction.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 merits briefs accordingly focused on the attribution-of-contacts question, addressing the reasonableness inquiry (which had been litigated and decided below) in most of the space that remained.  See Brief for Petitioner 17\xe2\x80\x9337, 37\xe2\x80\x9343; Brief for Respondents 18\xe2\x80\x9347, 47\xe2\x80\x9359.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In bypassing the question on which we granted certio-rari to decide an issue not litigated below, the Court leaves respondents \xe2\x80\x9cwithout an unclouded opportunity to airthe issue the Court today decides against them,\xe2\x80\x9d Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).  Doing so \xe2\x80\x9cdoes \xe2\x80\x98not reflect well on the processes of the Court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Redrup v. New York,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 767,\n772 (1967)\n (Harlan, J., dissenting)).  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd by resolving a complex and fact-intensive question without the benefit of full briefing, the Court invites the error into which it has fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The relevant facts are undeveloped because Daimler conceded at the start of this litigation that MBUSA is subject to general jurisdiction based on its California contacts.  We therefore do not know the full extent of those contacts, though what little we do know suggests that Daimler was wise to concede what it did.  MBUSA imports more than 200,000 vehicles into the United States and distributes many of them to independent dealerships in California, where they are sold.  Declaration of Dr. Peter Wask\xc3\xb6nig in Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., No. 04\xe2\x80\x9300194\xe2\x80\x93RMW (ND Cal.), \xc2\xb6\xc2\xa010, p.\xc2\xa02.  MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s California sales account for 2.4% of Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s worldwide sales, which were $192 billion in 2004.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  And 2.4% of $192 billion is $4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure.  MBUSA also has multiple offices and facilities in California, including a regional headquarters.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the record does not answer a number of otherimportant questions.  Are any of Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s key files maintained in MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s California offices?  How many employees work in those offices?  Do those employees makeimportant strategic decisions or oversee in any manner Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s activities?  These questions could well affect whether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction.  After all, this Court upheld the exercise of general jurisdiction in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co.,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437\n\xe2\x80\x93448 (1952)\xe2\x80\x94which the majority refers to as a \xe2\x80\x9ctextbook case\xe2\x80\x9d of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x94on the basis that the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio, kept corporate files there, and oversaw the company\xe2\x80\x99s activities from the State.  California-based MBUSA employees may well have done similar things on Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  But because the Court decides the issue without a developed record, we will never know.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decisional process is problematic enough, I fear that process leads it to an even more troubling result.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Until today, our precedents had established a straightforward test for general jurisdiction: Does the defendant have \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous corporate operations within a state\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cso substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities\xe2\x80\x9d?  International Shoe Co. v. Washington,\n\n326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,\n318 (1945)\n; see also Helicop-teros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Hall,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408,\n416 (1984)\n (asking whether defendant had \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic general business contacts\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  In every case where we have applied this test, we have focused solely on the magnitude of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s in-state contacts, not the relative magnitude of those contacts in comparison to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with other States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Perkins, for example, we found an Ohio court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of general jurisdiction permissible where the president of the foreign defendant \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained an office,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdrew and distributed . . . salary checks,\xe2\x80\x9d used \xe2\x80\x9ctwo active bank accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csupervised . . . the rehabilitation of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s properties in the Philippines,\xe2\x80\x9d and held \xe2\x80\x9cdirectors\xe2\x80\x99 meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d in Ohio.  342 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 447\xe2\x80\x93448.  At no point did we attempt to catalog the company\xe2\x80\x99s contacts in forums other than Ohio or to compare them with its Ohio contacts.  If anything, we intimated that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Ohio contacts were not substantial in comparison to its contacts elsewhere.  See id., at 438 (noting that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Ohio contacts, while \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic,\xe2\x80\x9d were but a \xe2\x80\x9climited .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. part of its general business\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We engaged in the same inquiry in Helicopteros.  There, we held that a Colombian corporation was not subject to general jurisdiction in Texas simply because it occasion-ally sent its employees into the State, accepted checks drawn on a Texas bank, and purchased equipment and services from a Texas company.  In no sense did our analysis turn on the extent of the company\xe2\x80\x99s operations beyond Texas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Most recently, in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), our analysis again focused on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s in-state contacts.  Goodyear involved a suit against foreign tire manufacturers by North Carolina residents whose children had died in a bus accident in France.  We held that North Carolina courts could not exercise general jurisdiction over the foreign defendants.  Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our opinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 contacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and business operations within the State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This approach follows from the touchstone principle of due process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.  When a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and protections of a State in which it operates, the State acquires the authority to subject the company to suit in its courts.  See International Shoe, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state\xe2\x80\x9d such that an \xe2\x80\x9cobligatio[n] arise[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to respond there to suit); J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5) (same principle for generaljurisdiction).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the extent of a corporate defendant\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-forum contacts is untethered from this rationale.  After all, the degree to which a company intentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its interactions with that State, not its interactions elsewhere.  An article on which the majority relies (and on which Goodyear relied as well, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)) expresses the point well: \xe2\x80\x9cWe should not treat defendants as less amenable to suit merely because they carry on more substantial business in other states . . . . [T]he amount of activity elsewhere seems virtually irrelevant to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the imposition of general jurisdiction over a defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brilmayer et\xc2\xa0al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 721, 742 (1988).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Had the majority applied our settled approach, it would have had little trouble concluding that Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s California contacts rise to the requisite level, given the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts may be attributed to Daimler and given Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s concession that those contacts render MBUSA \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in California.  Our cases have long stated the rule that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with a forum State must be continuous, substantial, and systematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that State\xe2\x80\x99s general jurisdiction.  See Perkins, 342 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 446.  We offered additional guidance in Goodyear, adding the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cessentially at home\xe2\x80\x9d to our prior formulation of the rule.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (a State may exercise general jurisdiction where a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caffiliations with the State are so \xe2\x80\x98continuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x99 as to render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum State\xe2\x80\x9d).  We used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d to signify that in order for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general jurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a forum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise that actually is \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in the State.  See Brilmayer, supra, at 742.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under this standard, Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s concession that MBUSA is subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession the Court accepts, ante, at 15, 17) should be dispositive.  For if MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s California contacts are so substantial and the resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make MBUSA \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in California, the same must be true of Daimler when MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s contacts and benefits are viewed as its own.  Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this Court, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for eight years of the litigation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority today concludes otherwise.  Referring to the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d contacts inquiry that has been taught to generations of first-year law students as \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptably grasping,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 19, the majority announces the new rule that in order for a foreign defendant to be subject to general jurisdiction, it must not only possess continuous and systematic contacts with a forum State, but those contacts must also surpass some unspecified level when viewed in comparison to the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide and worldwide\xe2\x80\x9d activities.  Ante, at 21, n.\xc2\xa020.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Neither of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s two rationales for this proportionality requirement is persuasive.  First, the majority suggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of predictability.  Permitting general jurisdiction in every State where a corporation has continuous and substantial contacts, the majority asserts, would \xe2\x80\x9cscarcely permit out-of-state defendants \xe2\x80\x98to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 21 (quoting Burger King Corp., 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 472).  But there is nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multinational corporations that if they engage in continuous and substantial contacts with more than one State, they will be subject to general jurisdiction in each one.  The majority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but such disagreement does not render an otherwise routine test unpredictable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s proportionality inquiry any more predictable than the approach it rejects.  If anything, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach injects an additional layer of uncertainty because a corporate defendant must now try to foretell a court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its contacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative sufficiency of those contacts in light of the company\xe2\x80\x99s operations elsewhere.  Moreover, the majority does not even try to explain just how extensive the company\xe2\x80\x99sin-state contacts must be in the context of its global oper-ations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach will also lead to greater unpredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional discovery.  Rather than ascertaining the extent of a corporate defendant\xe2\x80\x99s forum-state contacts alone, courts will now have to identify the extent of a company\xe2\x80\x99s contacts in every other forum where it does business in order to compare them against the company\xe2\x80\x99s in-state contacts.  That considerable burden runs headlong into the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the familiar principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]imple jurisdictional rules .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. promote greater predictability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77,\n94 (2010)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Absent the predictability rationale, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s sole remaining justification for its proportionality approach is its unadorned concern for the consequences.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority laments, \xe2\x80\x9cthe same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA\xe2\x80\x99s sales are sizable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 20.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority characterizes this result as \xe2\x80\x9cexorbitant,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the rule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that there are \xe2\x80\x9cinstances in which [a company\xe2\x80\x99s] continuous corporate operations within a state\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cso substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities,\xe2\x80\x9d International Shoe, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318.  In the era of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to have such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be subject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.  Today, that circumstance is less rare.  But that is as it should be.  What has changed since International Shoe is not the due process principle of fundamental fairness but rather the nature of the global economy.  Just as it was fair to say in the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s that an out-of-state company could enjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it \xe2\x80\x9cessentially at home\xe2\x80\x9d in the State, it is fair to say today that a multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive benefits in multiple forum States that it is \xe2\x80\x9cessentiallyat home\xe2\x80\x9d in each one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned with the modern-day consequences of International Shoe\xe2\x80\x99s conception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other judicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting unfairness to large corporate defendants.  Here, for instance, the reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In other cases, a defendant can assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a highly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute.  See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert,\n\n330 U.\xc2\xa0S. 501\n\xe2\x80\x93509 (1947).  In still other cases, the federal change of venue statute can provide protection.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71404(a) (permitting transfers to other districts \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d).  And to the degree that the majority worries these doctrines are not enough to protect the economic interests of multinational businesses (or that our longstanding approach to general jurisdiction poses \xe2\x80\x9crisks to international comity,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns belongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state and federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the democratic process.  Unfortunately, the majority short circuits that process by enshrining today\xe2\x80\x99s narrow rule of general jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority\xe2\x80\x99s concern for the consequences of its decision should have led it the other way, because the rule that it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four respects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach unduly curtails the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against corporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and substantial business operations within their boundaries.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  The majority does not dispute that a State can exercise general jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its corporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of business within the State.  Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 93.  Yet it never explains why the State should lose that power when, as is increasingly common, a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cdivide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  Suppose a company divides its management functions equally among three offices in different States, with one office nominally deemed the company\xe2\x80\x99s corporate headquarters.  If the State where the headquarters is located can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the other two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the same?  Indeed, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the result would be unchanged even if the company has substantial operations within the latter two States (and even if the company has no sales or other business operations in the first State).  Put simply, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule defines the Due Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to contravene the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign prerogative to subject to judgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified \xe2\x80\x9cintention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the[ir] laws,\xe2\x80\x9d J. McIntyre, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, the proportionality approach will treat small businesses unfairly in comparison to national and multinational conglomerates.  Whereas a larger company will often be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on account of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small business will not be.  For instance, the majority holds today that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in California despite its multiple offices, continuous operations, and billions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of sales there.  But imagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehicles principally targeting the California market and that has substantially all of its sales and operations in the State\xe2\x80\x94even though those sales and operations may amount to one-thousandth of Daimler\xe2\x80\x99s.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in California on any cause of action involving any of its activities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive competitor, Daimler, will not be.  That will be so even if the small business incorporates and sets up its headquarters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business\xe2\x80\x99 California sales and operations would still predominate when \xe2\x80\x9capprais[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d in proportion to its minimal \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide and worldwide\xe2\x80\x9d operations, ante, at 21, n.\xc2\xa020.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach creates the incongruous result that an individual defendant whose only contact with a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to general jurisdiction if served with process during that visit, Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n\n495 U. S. 604 (1990)\n, but a large corporation that owns property, employs workers, and does billions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of business in the State will not be, simply because the corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the visiting individual surely does as well).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach will be to shift the risk of loss from multinational corporations to the individuals harmed by their actions.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, for example, a parent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a foreign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will be unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U.\xc2\xa0S. court, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in multiple States.  See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int\xe2\x80\x99l Hotels, Ltd., 288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  Similarly, a U.\xc2\xa0S. business that enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its products to a multinational company there may be unable to seek relief in any U.\xc2\xa0S. court if the multinational company breaches the contract, even if that company has considerable operations in numerous U. S. forums.  See, e.g., Walpex Trading Co. v. Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, 712 F. Supp. 383 (SDNY 1989).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach would preclude the plaintiffs in these examples from seeking recourse anywhere in the United States even if no other judicial system was available to provide relief.  I cannot agree with the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Due Process Clause requires these results.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*  *  *</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court rules against respondents today on a ground that no court has considered in the history of this case, that this Court did not grant certiorari to decide, and that Daimler raised only in a footnote of its brief.  In doing so, the Court adopts a new rule of constitutional law that is unmoored from decades of precedent.  Because I would reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the narrower ground that the exercise of jurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable in any event, I respectfully concur in the judgment only.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that the reasonableness prong does in fact apply in the general jurisdiction context.

Without the benefit of a single page of briefing on the issue, the majority casually adds each of these cases to the mounting list of decisions jettisoned as a consequence of today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.
