(BIA), filed a voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  Respondent Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy trustee, filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against petitioner Executive Benefits Insurance Agency (EBIA) and others alleging the fraudulent conveyance of assets from BIA to EBIA.  The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for the trustee.  EBIA appealed to the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee.  While EBIA\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, this Court held that Article III did not permit a Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious interference, even though final adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized by statute.  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  In light of Stern, EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  The Ninth Circuit rejected EBIA\xe2\x80\x99s motion and affirmed.  It acknowledged the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s claims as \xe2\x80\x9cStern claims,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., claims designated for final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter, but prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.  The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that EBIA had impliedly consented to jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals also observed that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment could instead be treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to de novo review by the District Court.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        1.\xc2\xa0Under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory categories of proceedings: \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-core\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  See generally\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157.

The Court held that Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to finally adjudicate the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d claim of tortious interference.  The Court did not, however, address how courts should proceed when they encounter a Stern claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        2.\xc2\xa0Stern claims may proceed as non-core within the meaning of \xc2\xa7157(c).  Lower courts have described Stern claims as creating a statutory \xe2\x80\x9cgap,\xe2\x80\x9d since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.  However, this so-called gap is closed by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s severability provision, which instructs that where a \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of the Act or [its] application .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is held invalid, the remainder of th[e] Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n98Stat.\n344.  As applicable here, when a court identifies a Stern claim, it has \xe2\x80\x9cheld invalid\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7157(b), and the \xe2\x80\x9cremainder\xe2\x80\x9d not affected includes \xc2\xa7157(c), which governs non-core proceedings.  Accordingly, where a claim otherwise satisfies \xc2\xa7157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the Stern claim as non-core.  This conclusion accords with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s general approach to severability, which is to give effect to the valid portion of a statute so long as it \xe2\x80\x9cremains \xe2\x80\x98fully operative as a law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Free Enterprise Fund v.

This Court assumes without deciding that these claims are Stern claims, which Article III does not permit to be treated as \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d claims under \xc2\xa7157(b).  But because the claims assert that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed, they are self-evidently \xe2\x80\x9crelated to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, they fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by \xc2\xa7157(c)(1). The Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow that provision\xe2\x80\x99s procedures, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the District Court for de novo review.

EBIA contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an Article III court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy court adjudication.  In the alternative, EBIA asserts that even if such consent were constitutionally permissible, it did not in fact consent.  Neither contention need be addressed here, because EBIA received the same review from the District Court that it would have received had the Bankruptcy Court treated the claims as non-core proceedings under \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).

Marshall, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), this Court held that even though bankruptcy courts are statutorily authorized to enter final judgment on a class of bankruptcy-related claims, Article III of the Constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from finally adjudicating certain of those claims.  Stern did not, however, decide how bankruptcy or district courts should proceed when a \xe2\x80\x9cStern claim\xe2\x80\x9d is identified.  We hold today that when, under Stern\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, the Constitution does not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a bankruptcy-related claim, the relevant statute nevertheless permits a bankruptcy court to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to be reviewed de\xc2\xa0novo by the district court.  Because the District Court in this case conducted the de\xc2\xa0novo review that petitioner demands, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nicolas Paleveda and his wife owned and operated two companies\xe2\x80\x94Aegis Retirement Income Services, Inc. (ARIS), and Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA).  By early 2006, BIA had become insolvent, and on January 31, 2006, the company ceased operation.  The next day, Paleveda used BIA funds to incorporate Executive Benefits Insurance Agency, Inc. (EBIA), petitioner in this case.  Paleveda and others initiated a scheme to transfer assets from BIA to EBIA.  The assets were deposited into an account held jointly by ARIS and EBIA and ultimately credited to EBIA at the end of the year.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On June 1, 2006, BIA filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington.  Peter Arkison, the bankruptcy trustee and respondent in this case, filed a complaint in the same Bankruptcy Court against EBIA and others.  As relevant here, the complaint alleged that Paleveda used various methods to fraudulently convey BIA assets to EBIA.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  EBIA filed an answer and denied many of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After some disagreement as to whether the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s claims should continue in the Bankruptcy Court or instead proceed before a jury in Federal District Court, the trustee filed a motion for summary judgment against EBIA in the Bankruptcy Court.  The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for the trustee on all claims, including the fraudulent conveyance claims.  EBIA then appealed that determination to the District Court.  The District Court conducted de\xc2\xa0novo review, affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and entered judgment for the trustee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EBIA appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  After EBIA filed its opening brief, this Court decided Stern, supra.  In Stern, we held that Article III of the Constitution did not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious interference, id., at ___, even though final adjudication of that claim by the Bankruptcy Court was authorized by statute, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, infra.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  In light of Stern, EBIA moved to dismiss its appeal in the Ninth Circuit for lack of jurisdiction, contending that Article III did not permit Congress to vest authority in a bankruptcy court to finally decide the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent conveyance claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit rejected EBIA\xe2\x80\x99s motion and affirmed the District Court.  In\xc2\xa0re Bellingham Ins. Agency, Inc., 702 F.\xc2\xa03d 553 (2012).  As relevant here, the court held that Stern, supra, and Granfinanciera, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Nordberg,\n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33 (1989)\n,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] taken together, lead to the conclusion that Article III does not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a fraudulent conveyance claim against a noncreditor unless the parties consent.  702 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 565.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that EBIA had impliedly consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, and that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the fraudulent conveyance claim was therefore permissible.  Id., at 566, 568.  The Court of Appeals also observed that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment could instead be treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to de\xc2\xa0novo review by the District Court.

This approach accords with the bankruptcy statute and does not implicate the constitutional defect identified by Stern.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We begin with an overview of modern bankruptcy legislation.  Prior to 1978, federal district courts could refer matters within the traditional \xe2\x80\x9csummary jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of bankruptcy courts to specialized bankruptcy referees.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,\n\n458 U. S. 50,\n53 (1982)\n (plurality opinion).  Summary jurisdiction covered claims involving \xe2\x80\x9cproperty in the actual or constructive possession of the [bankruptcy] court,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., i.e., claims regarding the apportionment of the existing bankruptcy estate among creditors.  See Brubaker, A \xe2\x80\x9cSummary\xe2\x80\x9d Statutory and Constitutional Theory of Bankruptcy Judges\xe2\x80\x99 Core Jurisdiction After Stern v. Marshall, 86 Am. Bankr. L. J. 121, 124 (2012).  Proceedings to augment the bankruptcy estate, on the other hand, implicated the district court\xe2\x80\x99s plenary jurisdiction and were not referred to the bankruptcy courts absent both parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent.  See MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co.,\n\n286 U.\xc2\xa0S. 263,\n266 (1932)\n; see also Brubaker, supra, at 128.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 1978, Congress enacted sweeping changes to the federal bankruptcy laws.  See\n\n92Stat.\n2549.  The Bankruptcy Reform Act eliminated the historical distinction between \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98summary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction belonging to bankruptcy courts and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plenary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction belonging to either a district court or an appropriate state court.

Instead, the 1978 Act mandated that bankruptcy judges \xe2\x80\x9cshall exercise\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9call civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71471(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  Under the 1978 Act, bankruptcy judges were \xe2\x80\x9cvested with all of the \xe2\x80\x98powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with only a few limited exceptions.  Northern Pipeline, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55 (plurality opinion) (quoting \xc2\xa71481).  Notwithstanding their expanded jurisdiction and authority, these bankruptcy judges were not afforded the protections of Article III\xe2\x80\x94namely, life tenure and a salary that may not be diminished.  Id.,at 53.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Northern Pipeline, this Court addressed whether bankruptcy judges under the 1978 Act could \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\xe2\x80\x9d against an entity not otherwise a party to the proceeding.  Id., at 53, 87, n.\xc2\xa040.  The Court concluded that assignment of that claim for resolution by the bankruptcy judge \xe2\x80\x9cviolates Art. III of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 52, 87 (plurality opinion); see id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court distinguished between cases involving so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which may be removed from the jurisdiction of Article\xc2\xa0III courts, and cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which may not.  See id., at 69\xe2\x80\x9371 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  Specifically, the plurality noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the federal bankruptcy power, must be distinguished from the adjudication of state-created private rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which belong in an Article III court.

See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7151 et\xc2\xa0seq.  Under the 1984 Act, federal district courts have \xe2\x80\x9coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71334(a), and may refer to bankruptcy judges any \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7157(a).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Bankruptcy judges serve 14-year terms subject to removal for cause, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7152(a)(1), (e), and their salaries are set by Congress, \xc2\xa7153(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The 1984 Act largely restored the bifurcated jurisdictional scheme that existed prior to the 1978 Act.  The 1984 Act implements that bifurcated scheme by dividing all matters that may be referred to the bankruptcy courtinto two categories: \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-core\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  See generally \xc2\xa7157.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  It is the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to determine whether each claim before it is core or non-core.  \xc2\xa7157(b)(3); cf.

For core proceedings, the statute contains a nonexhaustive list of examples, including\xe2\x80\x94as relevant here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cproceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(H).

If a matter is non-core, and the parties have not consented to final adjudication by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy judge must propose findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Then, the district court must review the proceeding de\xc2\xa0novo and enter final judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, confronted an underlying conflict between the 1984 Act and the requirements of Article III.  In particular, Stern considered a constitutional challenge to the statutory designation of a particular claim as \xe2\x80\x9ccore.\xe2\x80\x9d  The bankrupt in that case had filed a common-law counterclaim for tortious interference against a creditor to the estate.  Id., at ___.  Section 157(b)(2)(C), as added by the 1984 Act, lists \xe2\x80\x9ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate\xe2\x80\x9d as a core proceeding, thereby authorizing the bankruptcy court to adjudicate the claim to final judgment.  See supra this page.  The respondent in Stern objected that Congress had violated Article III by vesting the power to adjudicate the tortious interference counterclaim in bankruptcy court.  Stern, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We agreed.  Id., at ___.  In that circumstance, we held, Congress had improperly vested the Bankruptcy Court with the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0judicial Power of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d just as in Northern Pipeline.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 21, 38).  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o \xe2\x80\x98public right\xe2\x80\x99 exception excuse[d] the failure to comply with Article III,\xe2\x80\x9d we concluded that Congress could not confer on the Bankruptcy Court the authority to finally decide the claim.  Id., at ___.  (slip op., at 21).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Stern made clear that some claims labeled by Congress as \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d may not be adjudicated by a bankruptcy court in the manner designated by \xc2\xa7157(b).  Stern did not, how-ever, address how the bankruptcy court should proceed under those circumstances.  We turn to that question now.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit held that the fraudulent conveyance claims at issue here are Stern claims\xe2\x80\x94that is, proceedings that are defined as \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7157(b) but may not, as a constitutional matter, be adjudicated as such (at least in the absence of consent, see n.\xc2\xa04, supra.  See 702 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 562.  Neither party contests that conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The lower courts, including the Ninth Circuit in this case, have described Stern claims as creating a statutory \xe2\x80\x9cgap.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., 702 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 565.  By definition, a Stern claim may not be adjudicated to final judgment by the bankruptcy court, as in a typical core proceeding.  But the alternative procedure, whereby the bankruptcy court submits proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, applies only to non-core claims.  See \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).  Because \xc2\xa7157(b) does not explicitly authorize bankruptcy judges to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding, the argument goes, Stern created a \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d in the bankruptcy statute.  See 702 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 565.  That gap purportedly renders the bankruptcy court powerless to act on Stern claims, see Brief for Petitioner 46\xe2\x80\x9348, thus requiring the district court to hear all Stern claims in the first instance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We disagree.  The statute permits Stern claims to proceed as non-core within the meaning of \xc2\xa7157(c).  In particular, the statute contains a severability provision that accounts for decisions, like Stern, that invalidate certain applications of the statute:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIf any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act, or the application of that provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n98Stat.\n344, note following\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7151.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plain text of this severability provision closes the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d created by Stern claims.  When a court identifies a claim as a Stern claim, it has necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cheld invalid\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7157(b)\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d label and its attendant procedures\xe2\x80\x94to the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Note following \xc2\xa7151.  In that circumstance, the statute instructs that \xe2\x80\x9cthe remainder of th[e] Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not affected thereby.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That remainder includes \xc2\xa7157(c), which governs non-core proceedings.  With the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d category no longer available for the Stern claim at issue, we look to \xc2\xa7157(c)(1) to determine whether the claim may be adjudicated as a non-core claim\xe2\x80\x94specifically, whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a core proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d but is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise related to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the claim satisfies the criteria of \xc2\xa7157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court simply treats the claims as non-core: The bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of lawto the district court for de novo review and entry ofjudgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The conclusion that the remainder of the statute may continue to apply to Stern claims accords with our general approach to severability.  We ordinarily give effect to the valid portion of a partially unconstitutional statute so long as it \xe2\x80\x9cremains \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfully operative as a law,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477,\n509 (2010)\n (quoting New York v. United States,\n\n505 U. S. 144,\n186 (1992)\n), and so long as it is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98evident\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from the statutory text and context that Congress would have preferred no statute at all, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 509 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,\n\n480 U. S. 678,\n684 (1987)\n).  Neither of those concerns applies here.  Thus, \xc2\xa7157(c) may be applied naturally to Stern claims.  And, EBIA has identified \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text or historical context\xe2\x80\x9d that makes it \xe2\x80\x9cevident\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress would prefer to suspend Stern claims in limbo.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 509.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Now we must determine whether the procedures set forth in \xc2\xa7157(c)(1) apply to the fraudulent conveyance claims at issue in this case.  The Court of Appeals held, and we assume without deciding, that the fraudulent conveyance claims in this case are Stern claims.  See Part III, supra. For purposes of this opinion, the \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d of both the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d label and the procedures of \xc2\xa7157(b) to the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s claims has therefore been \xe2\x80\x9cheld invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Note following \xc2\xa7151.  Accordingly, we must decide whether the fraudulent conveyance claims brought by the trustee are within the scope of \xc2\xa7157(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. core\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings but \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise related to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  We hold that this language encompasses the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s claims of fraudulent conveyance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, the fraudulent conveyance claims in this case are \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. core.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit held\xe2\x80\x94and no party disputes\xe2\x80\x94that Article III does not permit these claims to be treated as \xe2\x80\x9ccore.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Part III, supra.  Second, the fraudulent conveyance claims are self-evidently \xe2\x80\x9crelated to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  At bottom, a fraudulent conveyance claim asserts that property that should have been part of the bankruptcy estate and therefore available for distribution to creditors pursuant to Title 11 was improperly removed.  That sort of claim is \xe2\x80\x9crelated to a case under title 11\xe2\x80\x9d under any plausible construction of the statutory text, and no party contends otherwise.  See, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Edwards,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 300\n, n.\xc2\xa05, 308 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cProceedings \xe2\x80\x98related to\xe2\x80\x99 the bankruptcy include .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. suits between third parties which have an effect on the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, because these Stern claims fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by \xc2\xa7157(c)(1), the Bankruptcy Court would have been permitted to follow the procedures required by that provision, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the District Court to be reviewed de novo.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although this case did not proceed in precisely that fashion, we affirm nonetheless.  A brief procedural history of the case helps explain why.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As noted, \xc2\xa7157 permits a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a claim to final judgment in two circumstances\xe2\x80\x94in core proceedings, see \xc2\xa7157(b), and in non-core proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cwith the consent of all the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7157(c)(2).  In this case, the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of the bankruptcy trustee without specifying in its order whether it was acting pursuant to \xc2\xa7157(b) (core) or \xc2\xa7157(c)(2) (non-core with consent). EBIA immediately appealed to the District Court, see \xc2\xa7158, but it did not argue that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to grant summary judgment.  As a result, the District Court did not analyze whether there was a Stern problem and did not, as some district courts have done, relabel the bankruptcy order as mere proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Parco Merged Media Corp., 489 B.\xc2\xa0R. 323, 326 (Me. 2013) (collecting cases).  The District Court did, however, review de\xc2\xa0novo the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment for the trustee\xe2\x80\x94a legal question\xe2\x80\x94and issued a reasoned opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court.  The District Court then separately entered judgment in favor of the trustee.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71334(b) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. related to cases under title 11\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EBIA now objects on constitutional grounds to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of the fraudulent conveyance claims.  EBIA contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review of its fraudulent conveyance claims by an Article III court regardless of whether the parties consented to adjudication by a bankruptcy court.  Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  In an alternative argument, EBIA asserts that even if the Constitution permitted the Bankruptcy Court to adjudicate its claim with the consent of the parties, it did not in fact consent.  Id., at 38.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In light of the procedural posture of this case, however, we need not decide whether EBIA\xe2\x80\x99s contentions are correct on either score.  At bottom, EBIA argues that it was entitled to have an Article III court review de novo and enter judgment on the fraudulent conveyance claims asserted by the trustee.  In effect, EBIA received exactly that.  The District Court conducted de\xc2\xa0novo review of the summary judgment claims, concluding in a written opinion that there were no disputed issues of material fact and that the trustee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In accordance with its statutory authority over matters related to the bankruptcy, see \xc2\xa71334(b), the District Court then separately entered judgment in favor of the trustee.  EBIA thus received the same review from the District Court that it would have received if the Bankruptcy Court had treated the fraudulent conveyance claims as non-core proceedings under \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).  In short, even if EBIA is correct that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s entry of judgment was invalid, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s de\xc2\xa0novo review and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any error. Cf. Carter v. Kubler,\n\n320 U.\xc2\xa0S. 243,\n248 (1943)\n (bankruptcy commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s error was cured after the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cmadean independent and complete review of the conflicting evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The trustee asserted claims of fraudulent conveyance under\n, and under state law, Wash.
