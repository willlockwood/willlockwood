More important is the fact that the \xc2\xa7 106 rights are subject to all of the provisions of "[\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 ]107 through 120." If \xc2\xa7 602(a) functioned independently, none of those sections would limit its coverage. pp. 149-151.</p><p>(e) The Court finds unpersuasive the Solicitor General\'s argument that "importation" describes an act that is not protected by \xc2\xa7 109(a)\'s authorization to a subsequent owner "to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of" a copy. An ordinary interpretation of that language includes the right to ship the copy to another person in another country. More important, the Solicitor General\'s cramped reading is at odds with \xc2\xa7 109(a)\'s necessarily broad reach. The whole point of the first sale doctrine is that once the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce by selling it, he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution. There is no reason to assume that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 109(a) to limit the doctrine\'s scope.

Section 106(3) of the Copyright Act of 1976 (Act), 17 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 106(3), gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to distribute copies of a copyrighted work. That exclusive right is expressly limited, however, by the provisions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 107 through 120. Section 602(a) gives the copyright owner the right to prohibit the unauthorized importation of copies. The question presented by this case is whether the right granted by \xc2\xa7 602(a) is also limited by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 107 through 120. More narrowly, the question is whether the "first sale" doctrine endorsed in \xc2\xa7 109(a) is applicable to imported copies.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Respondent, L\'anza Research International, Inc. (L\'anza), is a California corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling shampoos, conditioners, and other hair care products. L\'anza has copyrighted the labels that are affixed to those products. In the United States, L\'anza sells exclusively to domestic distributors who have agreed to resell within limited geographic areas and then only to authorized retailers such as barber shops, beauty salons, and professional hair care colleges. Uanza has found that the American "public is generally unwilling to pay the price charged for high quality products, such as L\'anza\'s products, when they are sold along with the less expensive lower quality products that are generally carried by supermarkets and</p><p>ard Kelly, and Robert J.

App. 54 (declaration of Robert Hall). Uanza promotes the domestic sales of its products with extensive advertising in various trade magazines and at point of sale, and by providing special training to authorized retailers.</p><p>L\'anza also sells its products in foreign markets. In those markets, however, it does not engage in comparable advertising or promotion; its prices to foreign distributors are 35% to 40% lower than the prices charged to domestic distributors. In 1992 and 1993, L\'anza\'s distributor in the United Kingdom arranged the sale of three shipments to a distributor in Malta; 1 each shipment contained several tons of L\'anza products with copyrighted labels affixed.2 The record does not establish whether the initial purchaser was the distributor in the United Kingdom or the distributor in Malta, or whether title passed when the goods were delivered to the carrier or when they arrived at their destination, but it is undisputed that the goods were manufactured by L\'anza and first sold by Uanza to a foreign purchaser.</p><p>It is also undisputed that the goods found their way back to the United States without the permission of L\'anza and were sold in California by unauthorized retailers who had purchased them at discounted prices from Quality King Distributors, Inc. (petitioner). There is some uncertainty about the identity of the actual importer, but for the purpose of our decision we assume that petitioner bought all three shipments from the Malta distributor, imported them, and then resold them to retailers who were not in L\'anza\'s authorized chain of distribution.</p><p>After determining the source of the unauthorized sales, L\'anza brought suit against petitioner and several other defendants.3 The complaint alleged that the importation and</p><p>1 See App. 64 (declaration of Robert De Lanza). 2 See id., at 70-83.</p><p>3 Uanza\'s claims against the retailer defendants were settled.

S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106, 501 and 602 to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted material in the United States." App. 32. The District Court rejected petitioner\'s defense based on the "first sale" doctrine recognized by \xc2\xa7 109 and entered summary judgment in favor of L\'anza. Based largely on its conclusion that \xc2\xa7 602 would be "meaningless" if \xc2\xa7 109 provided a defense in a case of this kind, the Court of Appeals affirmed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/98/1109/">98 F.3d 1109</a>, 1114 (CA9 1996). Because its decision created a conflict with the Third Circuit, see <i>Sebastian Int\'Z, Inc. </i>v. <i>Consumer Contacts (PTY) Ltd., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/847/1093/">847 F.2d 1093</a> (1988), we granted the petition for certiorari. 520 U. S. 1250 (1997).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>This is an unusual copyright case because L\'anza does not claim that anyone has made unauthorized copies of its copyrighted labels. Instead, Uanza is primarily interested in protecting the integrity of its method of marketing the products to which the labels are affixed. Although the labels themselves have only a limited creative component, our interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions would apply equally to a case involving more familiar copyrighted materials such as sound recordings or books. Indeed, we first endorsed the first sale doctrine in a case involving a claim by a publisher that the resale of its books at discounted prices infringed its copyright on the books. <i>Bobbs-Merrill Co. </i>v. <i>Straus, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/210/339/case.html">210 U.

The defendants, who owned Macy\'s department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price without Bobbs-Merrill\'s consent. We held that the exclusive statutory right to "vend" 5 applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work:</p><blockquote><p>\n"What does the statute mean in granting \'the sole right of vending the same\'? Was it intended to create a right which would permit the holder of the copyright to fasten, by notice in a book or upon one of the articles mentioned within the statute, a restriction upon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one who had acquired full dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for it? It is not denied that one who has sold a copyrighted article, without restriction, has parted with all right to control the sale of it. The purchaser of a book, once sold by authority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again, although he could not publish a new edition of it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"In this case the stipulated facts show that the books sold by the appellant were sold at wholesale, and purchased by those who made no agreement as to the control of future sales of the book, and took upon themselves no obligation to enforce the notice printed in the book, undertaking to restrict retail sales to a price of one dollar per copy." <i>Id., </i>at 349-350.</p></blockquote><p>The statute in force when <i>Bobbs-Merrill </i>was decided provided that the copyright owner had the exclusive right to "vend" the copyrighted work. 6 Congress subsequently cod-</p><p>5 In 1908, when <i>Bobbs-Merrill </i>was decided, the copyright statute provided that copyright owners had "the sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing, finishing, and <i>vending" </i>their copyrighted works.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 106(3) is the right "to distribute copies ... by sale or other transfer of ownership." 8 The comparable limitation on that right is provided not by judicial interpretation, but by an express statutory provision. Section 109(a) provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord .... " 9</p></blockquote><p>7 Congress codified the first sale doctrine in \xc2\xa7 41 of the Copyright Act of 1909, ch. 320, 35 Stat. 1084, and again in \xc2\xa727 of the 1947 Act, ch. 391, 61 Stat. 660.</p><p>8The full text of \xc2\xa7 106 reads as follows:</p><p>"\xc2\xa7 106.

Because the basic holding in <i>Bobbs-Merrill </i>is now codified in \xc2\xa7 l09(a) of the Act, and because those domestic distributors are owners of the products that they purchased from Uanza (the labels of which were "lawfully made under this title"), L\'anza does not, and could not, claim that the statute would enable Uanza to treat unauthorized resales by its domestic distributors as an infringement of its exclusive right to distribute copies of its labels. Uanza does claim, however, that contractual provisions are inadequate to protect it from the actions of foreign distributors who may resell L\'anza\'s products to American vendors unable to buy from L\'anza\'s domestic distributors, and that \xc2\xa7 602(a) of the Act, properly construed, prohibits such unauthorized competition. To evaluate that submission, we must, of course, consider the text of \xc2\xa7 602(a).</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>The most relevant portion of \xc2\xa7 602(a) provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclu-</p></blockquote><p>of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained."

It is noteworthy that \xc2\xa7 109(a) of the 1978 Act does not apply to "any copy"; it applies only to a copy that was "lawfully made under this title."</p><p>10 "We do not think the statute can be given such a construction, and it is to be remembered that this is purely a question of statutory construction. There is no claim in this case of contract limitation, nor license agreement controlling the subsequent sales of the book." <i>Bobbs-Merrill Co. </i>v. <i>Straus, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/210/339/case.html">210 U.

" 11</p></blockquote><p>It is significant that this provision does not categorically prohibit the unauthorized importation of copyrighted materials. Instead, it provides that such importation is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies "under section 106." Like the exclusive right to "vend" that was construed in <i>Bobbs-Merrill, </i>the exclusive right to distribute is a limited right. The introductory language in \xc2\xa7 106 expressly states that all of the exclusive rights granted by that section-including, of course, the distribution right granted by subsection (3)-are limited by the provisions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 107 through 120.12 One of those limitations, as we have noted, is provided by the terms of \xc2\xa7 109(a), which expressly permit the owner of a lawfully made copy to sell that copy "[n]otwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3)." 13</p><p>11 The remainder of \xc2\xa7 602(a) reads as follows:</p><p>"This subsection does not apply to-</p><p>"(1) importation of copies or phonorecords under the authority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of any State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or phonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work imported for purposes other than archival use;</p><p>"(2) importation, for the private use of the importer and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more than one copy or phonorecord of anyone work at anyone time, or by any person arriving from outside the United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part of such person\'s personal baggage; or</p><p>"(3) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect to no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival purposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation of such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization in violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2)."</p><p>12 See n. 8, supra.</p><p>13 See text accompanying n. 9, supra.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="145">145</a></p><p>After the first sale of a copyrighted item "lawfully made under this title," any subsequent purchaser, whether from a domestic or from a foreign reseller, is obviously an "owner" of that item. Read literally, \xc2\xa7 109(a) unambiguously states that such an owner "is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell" that item. Moreover, since \xc2\xa7 602(a) merely provides that unauthorized importation is an infringement of an exclusive right "under section 106," and since that limited right does not encompass resales by lawful owners, the literal text of \xc2\xa7 602(a) is simply inapplicable to both domestic and foreign owners of L\'anza\'s products who decide to import them and resell them in the United States.14</p><p>Notwithstanding the clarity of the text of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106(3), 109(a), and 602(a), L\'anza argues that the language of the Act supports a construction of the right granted by \xc2\xa7 602(a) as "distinct from the right under Section 106(3) standing alone," and thus not subject to \xc2\xa7 109(a). Brief for Respondent 15. Otherwise, Uanza argues, both the \xc2\xa7 602(a) right itself and its exceptions 15 would be superfluous. Moreover, supported by various <i>amici curiae, </i>including the Solicitor General of the United States, L\'anza contends that its construction is supported by important policy considerations. We consider these arguments separately.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>L\'anza advances two primary arguments based on the text of the Act: (1) that \xc2\xa7 602(a), and particularly its three exceptions, are superfluous if limited by the first sale doctrine; and (2) that the text of \xc2\xa7 501 defining an "infringer" refers</p><p>14 Despite Uanza\'s contention to the contrary, see Brief for Respondent 26-27, the owner of goods lawfully made under the Act is entitled to the protection of the first sale doctrine in an action in a United States court even if the first sale occurred abroad. Such protection does not require the extraterritorial application of the Act any more than \xc2\xa7 602(a)\'s "acquired abroad" language does.</p><p>15 See n. 11, supra.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="146">146</a></p><p>separately to violations of \xc2\xa7 106, on the one hand, and to imports in violation of \xc2\xa7 602. The short answer to both of these arguments is that neither adequately explains why the words "under section 106" appear in \xc2\xa7 602(a). The Solicitor General makes an additional textual argument: he contends that the word "importation" in \xc2\xa7 602(a) describes an act that is not protected by the language in \xc2\xa7 109(a) authorizing a subsequent owner "to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of" a copy. Each of these arguments merits separate comment.</p><p>The Coverage of \xc2\xa7 602(a)</p><p>Prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa7 602(a), the Act already prohibited the importation of "piratical," or unauthorized, copies.16 Moreover, that earlier prohibition is retained in \xc2\xa7 602(b) of the present ActP L\'anza therefore argues (as do the Solicitor General and other <i>amici curiae) </i>that \xc2\xa7 602(a) is superfluous unless it covers nonpiratical ("lawfully made") copies sold by the copyright owner, because importation nearly always implies a first sale. There are several flaws in this argument.</p><p>First, even if \xc2\xa7 602(a) did apply only to piratical copies, it at least would provide the copyright holder with a private remedy against the importer, whereas the enforcement of \xc2\xa7 602(b) is vested in the Customs Service.18 Second, because the protection afforded by \xc2\xa7 109(a) is available only to the "owner" of a lawfully made copy (or someone authorized by the owner), the first sale doctrine would not provide a de-</p><p>16 See 17 U. S.

" The first sale doctrine of \xc2\xa7 109(a) does not protect owners of piratical copies, of course, because such copies were not "lawfully made."</p><p>18 See n. 17, supra.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="147">147</a></p><p>fense to a \xc2\xa7 602(a) action against any nonowner such as a bailee, a licensee, a consignee, or one whose possession of the copy was unlawful.19 Third, \xc2\xa7 602(a) applies to a category of copies that are neither piratical nor "lawfully made under this title." That category encompasses copies that were "lawfully made" not under the United States Copyright Act, but instead, under the law of some other country.</p><p>The category of copies produced lawfully under a foreign copyright was expressly identified in the deliberations that led to the enactment of the 1976 Act. We mention one example of such a comment in 1961 simply to demonstrate that the category is not a merely hypothetical one. In a report to Congress, the Register of Copyrights stated, in part:</p><blockquote><p>\n"When arrangements are made for both a U. S. edition and a foreign edition of the same work, the publishers frequently agree to divide the international markets. The foreign publisher agrees not to sell his edition in the United States, and the U. S. publisher agrees not to sell his edition in certain foreign countries. It has been suggested that the import ban on piratical copies should be extended to bar the importation of the foreign edition in contravention of such an agreement."

Print 1961).</p></blockquote><p>19 In its opinion in this case, the Court of Appeals quoted a statement by a representative of the music industry expressing the need for protection against the importation of stolen motion picture prints: "We\'ve had a similar situation with respect to motion picture prints, which are sent all over the world-legitimate prints made from the authentic negative. These prints get into illicit hands. They\'re stolen, and there\'s no contractual relationship .... Now those are not piratical copies."

The first sale doctrine would not provide the publisher of the British edition who decided to sell in the American market with a defense to an action under \xc2\xa7 602(a) (or, for that matter, to an action under \xc2\xa7 106(3), if there was a distribution of the copies).</p><p>The argument that the statutory exceptions to \xc2\xa7 602(a) are superfluous if the first sale doctrine is applicable rests on the assumption that the coverage of that section is coextensive with the coverage of \xc2\xa7 109(a).

"</p></blockquote><p>The use of the words <i>"or </i>who imports," rather than words such as <i>"including </i>one who imports," is more consistent with an interpretation that a violation of \xc2\xa7 602 is distinct from a violation of \xc2\xa7 106 (and thus not subject to the first sale doctrine set out in \xc2\xa7 109(a)) than with the view that it is a species of such a violation. Nevertheless, the force of that inference is outweighed by other provisions in the statutory text.</p><p>Most directly relevant is the fact that the text of \xc2\xa7 602(a) itself unambiguously states that the prohibited importation is an infringement of the exclusive distribution right "under section 106, actionable under section 501." Unlike that phrase, which identifies \xc2\xa7 602 violations as a species of \xc2\xa7 106 violations, the text of \xc2\xa7 106A, which is also cross-referenced in \xc2\xa7 501, uses starkly different language. It states that the author\'s right protected by \xc2\xa7 106A is "independent of the exclusive rights provided in Section 106." The contrast between the relevant language in \xc2\xa7 602 and that in \xc2\xa7 106A strongly implies that only the latter describes an independent right.21</p><p>21 The strength of the implication created by the relevant language in \xc2\xa7 106A is not diminished by the fact that Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 106A more</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="150">150</a></p><p>Of even greater importance is the fact that the \xc2\xa7 106 rights are subject not only to the first sale defense in \xc2\xa7 109(a), but also to all of the other provisions of "sections 107 through 120." If \xc2\xa7 602(a) functioned independently, none of those sections would limit its coverage. For example, the "fair use" defense embodied in \xc2\xa7 10722 would be unavailable to importers if \xc2\xa7 602(a) created a separate right not subject to the limitations on the \xc2\xa7 106(3) distribution right. Under L\'anza\'s interpretation of the Act, it presumably would be unlawful for a distributor to import copies of a British newspaper that contained a book review quoting excerpts from an American</p><p>recently than \xc2\xa7 602(a), which is part of the Copyright Act of 1976. Section 106A was passed as part of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 in order to protect the moral rights of certain visual artists. Section 106A is analogous to Article <i>6bis </i>of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, but its coverage is more limited. See 2 P. Goldstein, Copyright \xc2\xa7 5.12, p. 5:225 (2d ed. 1996) (\xc2\xa7 106A encompasses aspects of the moral rights guaranteed by Article <i>6bis </i>of the Berne Convention, "but effectively gives these rights a narrow subject matter and scope").</p><p>22 Title 17 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 107 provides as follows:</p><p>"\xc2\xa7 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use</p><p>"Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.

In construing the statute, however, we must remember that its principal purpose was to promote the progress of the "useful Arts," U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 8, by rewarding creativity, and its principal function is the protection of original works, rather than ordinary commercial products that use copyrighted material as a marketing aid. It is therefore appropriate to take into account the impact of the denial of the fair use defense for the importer of foreign publications. As applied to such publications, L\'anza\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 602 "would merely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit." <i>Sony Corp. of America </i>v. <i>Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 </i>U.

Strictly speaking, an importer could, of course, carry merchandise from one country to another without surrendering custody of it. In a typical commercial transaction, however, the shipper transfers "possession, custody, control and title to the products" 26 to a different person, and L\'anza assumes that petitioner\'s importation of the L\'anza shipments included such a transfer. An ordinary interpretation of the statement that a person is entitled "to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" of an item surely includes the right to ship it to another person in another country.</p><p>More important, the Solicitor General\'s cramped reading of the text of the statutes is at odds not only with \xc2\xa7 602(a)\'s more flexible treatment of unauthorized importation as an infringement of the distribution right (even when there is no literal "distribution"), but also with the necessarily broad reach of \xc2\xa7 l09(a). The whole point of the first sale doctrine is that once the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce by selling it, he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution. As we have recognized, the codification of that doctrine in \xc2\xa7 l09(a) makes it clear that the doctrine applies only to copies that are "lawfully made under this title," but that was also true of the copies involved in the <i>Bobbs-Merrill </i>case, as well as those involved in the earlier cases applying the doctrine. There is no reason to assume that Congress intended either \xc2\xa7 l09(a) or the earlier codifications of the doctrine to limit its broad scope.27</p><p>In sum, we are not persuaded by either L\'anza\'s or the Solicitor General\'s textual arguments.</p><p>26 App. 87.</p><p>27 See, <i>e. </i>g., H.
