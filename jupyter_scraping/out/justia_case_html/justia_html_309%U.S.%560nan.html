JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal under \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma denying recovery of taxes alleged to have been exacted from appellant, a national banking corporation, in violation of the provisions of R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219 and the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>Section 16 of the Oklahoma Income Tax Law of 1935, S.L.1935, c. 66, art. 6, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] lays a tax upon every national banking association located or doing business within the state "according to, or measured by, its net income" at the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 309 U. S. 562</a></p><p> rate of six percentum.  Section 17, 68 Okl.St.Ann. \xc2\xa7 888, provides for a similar tax upon state banks and Morris Plan Companies.</p>\n<p>The net income used as the measure of the tax under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 17 is determined by subtracting from gross income, as defined in \xc2\xa7 18, certain deductions allowed by \xc2\xa7 9.  Section 18 defines gross income for the purposes of "national banking associations, state banks, trust companies and other financial corporations" (\xc2\xa7 8(c)).  It specifically includes in gross income</p>\n<p>"interest upon the obligations of the United States, or its possessions, or upon securities issued under the authority of an Act of Congress, the income from which is tax free."</p>\n<p>All other types of corporations are taxed at the flat rate of six percentum upon the net income allocable to business transacted within the state (\xc2\xa7 6).  Net income for this purpose is determined by making certain specified deductions from gross income (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7, 9), which is defined expressly so as to exclude interest on tax-immune federal securities, \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4).</p>\n<p>The appellee Oklahoma Tax Commission, in assessing appellant\'s tax for the year 1936 under \xc2\xa7 16, included in gross income the dividends received by appellant on stock owned by it in a federal reserve bank and the interest received on bonds and notes issued pursuant to acts of Congress declaring the income from such securities tax exempt. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The present suit was brought by appellant to recover that portion of the tax, paid under protest, which resulted from including such dividends and interest in the computation. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="563">Page 309 U.

Method numbered (4) provides for a tax on such associations "according to, or measured by" "the entire net income received from all sources" subject only to certain restrictions as to the rate.  This method was added to the three previously authorized under R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219 by an amendment of March 25, 1926, c. 88, 44 Stat. 223.  The plain meaning of the amendment is confirmed by its legislative history showing beyond doubt that Congress intended to authorize a franchise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 309 U. S. 564</a></p><p> tax measured by net income including interest on tax-immune federal securities. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Oklahoma in the 1935 act expressly followed and adopted the method thus authorized in the amendment.  <em>See First National Bank v. Oklahoma Tax Commission,</em> 185 Okl. 98, 90 P.2d 438.  Subsection (b) of \xc2\xa7 16 expressly declares that the state thereby adopts method numbered (4) authorized by R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 548.</p>\n<p>The power of Congress to authorize a state to impose a tax on the franchise of a national banking association cannot now be doubted.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/573/case.html">Van Allen v.

The tax immunity conferred on the securities owned by appellant has not been shown to be any greater in extent than that conferred on the federal securities included in the measure of the taxes sustained in the cited cases.</p>\n<p>Sections 16 and 17 of the 1933 act were, for present purposes, identical with the corresponding sections of the 1935 act, but \xc2\xa7 18 of the prior act contained a provision expressly excluding from gross income the interest on tax immune federal securities.</p>\n<p>Appellant contends that the act of 1935, by expressly including in the measure of the tax the interest on federal securities which before had been expressly excluded from the measure, must be regarded not as a valid franchise tax, but as an unconstitutional levy on the tax-immune income itself.  In support of its position, its main reliance is placed upon our decision in <em>Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/279/620/case.html">279 U. S. 620</a></span>.</p>\n<p>A similar contention was urged against the California franchise tax measured by net income, including tax exempt income on state bonds, which was upheld in <em>Pacific Co. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/480/case.html">285 U. S. 480</a></span>.  In rejecting the claim, the holding in the <em>Macallen</em> case was referred to as follows (285 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/480/case.html#494">285 U. S. 494</a></span>):</p>\n<p>"There, the commonwealth, which had long imposed a tax on corporate franchises measured by taxable income of the corporation, amended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 309 U. S. 566</a></p><p> its statutes so as to add the income from tax exempt bonds of the federal government to the measure of the tax.  It was held that this change of taxation policy, embodied in the statute and \'adopted, as though it had been so declared in precise words for the very purpose of subjecting these securities <em>pro tanto</em> to the burden of the tax,\' was invalid.  Thus, the legislative abandonment of a policy which had previously discriminated in favor of tax-exempt securities was treated as a discrimination against them, and the tax, although in fact nondiscriminatory, was condemned as analogous to the discriminatory tax held invalid in the <em>Miller</em> case [<em>Miller v. Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/272/713/case.html">272 U. S. 713</a></span>]."</p>\n<p><em>See also Educational Films Corp. v.

S. 392</a></span>-393.</p>\n<p>It cannot be said that the Oklahoma tax in question here was aimed at tax-exempt federal securities in the manner thus disclosed and condemned in the <em>Macallen</em> case.  The history of the Oklahoma legislation on this subject discloses only that it sought to change its policy pursuant to the express authorization conferred by R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219.  It has effected its purpose by including within the measure of its franchise tax on national banks the entire net income without respect to source and without discrimination against tax exempt federal securities.  <em>See First National Bank v. Oklahoma Tax Commission,</em> 185 Okl. 98, 90 P.2d 438.</p>\n<p>We do not now decide just what circumstances, if any, would bring a situation within the precise scope of the <em>Macallen</em> case, assuming that case still has vitality.  It is sufficient to hold, as we do, that the statute in the instant case merits the test stated in <em>Pacific Co. v. Johnson, viz.:</em></p>\n<p>"Since the mere intent of the legislature to do that which the Constitution permits cannot deprive legislation of its constitutional validity, . . . the present act must be judged by its operation, rather than by the motives which inspired it.  As it operates to measure the tax on the corporate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 309 U. S. 567</a></p><p> franchise by the entire net income of the corporation, without any discrimination between income which is exempt and that which is not, there is no infringement of any constitutional immunity."</p>\n<p>Appellant finally contends that the tax here in question violates the restriction in R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219 that "the rate shall not be higher than . . . the highest of the rates assessed . . . upon mercantile, manufacturing, and business corporations doing business" within the state. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>A consideration of the course of judicial decision on R.S. \xc2\xa7 5219 and its predecessors can leave no doubt that the various restrictions it places on the permitted methods of taxation are designed to prohibit only those systems of state taxation which discriminate in practical operation against national banking associations or their shareholders as a class.  <em>Compare First National Bank v. Hartford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/548/case.html">273 U. S. 548</a></span>; <em>New York ex rel. Amoskeag Savings Bank v.

Thus, it is not a valid objection to a tax on national bank shares that other moneyed capital in the state or shares of state banks are taxed at a different rate or assessed by a different method unless it appears that the difference in treatment results in fact in a discrimination unfavorable to the holders of the shares of national banks.  <em>New York ex rel.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We think the same purpose to prevent actual discrimination, but to allow the states considerable freedom in working out an equitable tax system </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 309 U. S. 568</a></p><p> is discernable in the particular restriction upon which appellant relies.</p>\n<p>The resolution of the issue raised by appellant thus turns upon an examination of the whole tax structure of the state.  Counsel have stipulated that six thousand business and mercantile corporations, in addition to paying the income tax imposed by \xc2\xa7 6 on six percentum of their net income, filed a corporation license tax return for the year 1936 and paid a tax based on one dollar per one thousand dollars of the value of the capital stock employed within the state, and that the Government bonds held by each were included as capital in the measure of the franchise tax.  They further stipulated that only thirty-seven of these six thousand corporations owned Government bonds, and that, in the case of all but three, the franchise taxes paid exceeded the additional amounts which would have been due under the income tax imposed by \xc2\xa7 6 had their gross income, contrary to the fact, included the interest derived from the bonds.  In addition to the foregoing taxes, so it is stipulated, each of these corporations paid an <em>ad valorem</em> tax on its moneyed capital.</p>\n<p>This brief survey suffices to show that, considering all the taxes imposed upon business and mercantile corporations doing business in the state, the scheme of taxation adopted by Oklahoma does not discriminate against national banking associations.  Discrimination is not shown merely because a few individual corporations, out of a class of several thousand which ordinarily bear the same or a heavier tax burden, may sustain a lighter tax than that imposed on national banking associations.  <em>Compare New York ex rel.
