The District Court denied Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s application because, it reasoned, imposing a fee award against a losing party that had taken reasonable positions during litigation (as Wiley had done) would not serve the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.

The Court also noted \xe2\x80\x9cseveral nonexclusive factors\xe2\x80\x9d for courts to consider, <i>e.g.</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness[,] and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 534, n.\xc2\xa019, and left open the possibility of providing further guidance in the future, <i>id.</i>, at 534\xe2\x80\x93535.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This Court agrees with both Kirtsaeng and Wiley that additional guidance respecting the application of \xc2\xa7505 is proper so as to further channel district court discretion towards the purposes of the Copyright Act.  In addressing other open-ended fee-shifting statutes, this Court has emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cin a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits,\xe2\x80\x9d and it has \xe2\x80\x9cfound\xe2\x80\x9d those limits by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe large objectives of the relevant Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Flight Attendants</i> v. <i>Zipes</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 754\n.  In accord with such precedents, this Court must determine what approach to fee awards under \xc2\xa7505 best advances the well-settled objectives of the Copyright Act, which are to \xe2\x80\x9cenrich[ ] the general public through access to creative works\xe2\x80\x9d by striking a balance between encouraging and rewarding authors\xe2\x80\x99 creations and enabling others to build on that work.  <i>Fogerty</i>, 510 U. S., at 527, 526.  Fee awards should thus encourage the types of lawsuits that advance those aims.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s approach\xe2\x80\x94to put substantial weight on the reasonableness of a losing party\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x94passes this test because it enhances the probability that creators and users (<i>i.e.</i>, plaintiffs and defendants) will enjoy the substantive rights the Act provides.  Parties with strong positions are encouraged to stand on their rights, given the likelihood that they will recover fees from the losing (<i>i.e</i>., unreasonable) party; those with weak ones are deterred by the likelihood of having to pay two sets of fees.  By contrast, Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s proposal\xe2\x80\x94to give special consideration to whether a suit meaningfully clarified copyright law by resolving an important and close legal issue\xe2\x80\x94would produce no sure benefits.  Even accepting that litigation of close cases advances the public interest, fee-shifting will not necessarily, or even usually, encourage parties to litigate those cases to judgment.  While fees increase the reward for a victory, they also enhance the penalty for a defeat\xe2\x80\x94and the parties in hard cases cannot be confident if they will win or lose.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s approach is also more administrable.  A district court that has ruled on the merits of a copyright case can easily assess whether the losing party advanced an unreasonable position.  By contrast, a judge may not know whether a newly decided issue will have broad legal significance.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Still, objective reasonableness can be only a substantial factor in assessing fee applications\xe2\x80\x94not the controlling one.

Because the District Court thus may not have understood the full scope of its discretion, it should have the opportunity to reconsider Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s fee application.

The question pre-sented here is whether a court, in exercising that author-ity, should give substantial weight to the objective reasonableness of the losing party\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The answer, as both decisions below held, is yes\xe2\x80\x94the court should.  But the court must also give due consideration to all other circumstances relevant to granting fees; and it retains discretion, in light of those factors, to make an award even when the losing party advanced a reasonable claim or defense.  Because we are not certain that the lower courts here understood the full scope of that discretion, we return the case for further consideration of the prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s fee application.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner Supap Kirtsaeng, a citizen of Thailand, came to the United States 20 years ago to study math at Cornell University.  He quickly figured out that respondent John Wiley &amp; Sons, an academic publishing company, sold virtually identical English-language textbooks in the two countries\xe2\x80\x94but for far less in Thailand than in the United States.  Seeing a ripe opportunity for arbitrage, Kirtsaeng asked family and friends to buy the foreign editions in Thai bookstores and ship them to him in New York.  He then resold the textbooks to American students, reimbursed his Thai suppliers, and pocketed a tidy profit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Wiley sued Kirtsaeng for copyright infringement, claiming that his activities violated its exclusive right to distribute the textbooks.  See 17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7106(3), 602(a)(1).  Kirtsaeng invoked the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-sale doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d as a defense.  That doctrine typically enables the lawful owner of a book (or other work) to resell or otherwise dispose of it as he wishes.  See \xc2\xa7109(a).  But Wiley contended that the first-sale doctrine did not apply when a book (like those Kirtsaeng sold) was manufactured abroad.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the time, courts were in conflict on that issue.  Some thought, as Kirtsaeng did, that the first-sale doctrine permitted the resale of foreign-made books; others maintained, along with Wiley, that it did not.  And this Court, in its first pass at the issue, divided 4 to 4.  See <i>Costco Wholesale Corp.</i> v. <i>Omega, S.</i>\xc2\xa0<i>A.</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40 (2010)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  In this case, the District Court sided with Wiley; so too did a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  See 654 F.\xc2\xa03d 210, 214, 222 (2011).  To settle the continuing conflict, this Court granted Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari and reversed the Second Circuit in a 6-to-3 decision, thus establishing that the first-sale doctrine allows the resale of foreign-made books, just as it does domestic ones.  See <i>Kirtsaeng</i> v. <i>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Returning victorious to the District Court, Kirtsaeng invoked \xc2\xa7505 to seek more than $2 million in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees from Wiley.  The court denied his motion.  Relying on Second Circuit precedent, the court gave \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d of Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim.

In explanation of that approach, the court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe imposition of a fee award against a copyright holder with an objectively reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94although unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clit-igation position will generally not<i> </i>promote the purposes of the Copyright Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 11a (quoting <i>Matthew Bender &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>West Publishing Co.</i>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 122 (CA2 2001) (emphasis deleted)).  Here, Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s position was reasonable: After all, several Courts of Appeals and three Justices of the Supreme Court had agreed with it.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a.  And according to the District Court, no other circumstance \xe2\x80\x9coverr[o]de\xe2\x80\x9d that objective reasonableness, so as to warrant fee-shifting.  <i>Id.</i>, at 22a.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding in a brief summary order that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court properly placed \xe2\x80\x98substantial weight\xe2\x80\x99 on the reasonableness of [Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s] position\xe2\x80\x9d and committed no abuse of discretion in deciding that other \xe2\x80\x9cfactors did not outweigh\xe2\x80\x9d the reasonableness finding.  605 Fed.

See <i>id.,</i> at 519 (asking \xe2\x80\x9cwhat standards should inform\xe2\x80\x9d the exercise of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s authority).  The statutory language, we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cclearly connotes discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d and eschews any \xe2\x80\x9cprecise rule or formula\xe2\x80\x9d for awarding fees.  <i>Id.,</i> at 533, 534.  Still, we established a pair of restrictions.  First, a district court may not \xe2\x80\x9caward[\xc2\xa0] attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees as a matter of course\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, a court must make a more particularized, case-by-case assessment.  <i>Id.,</i> at 533.  Second, a court may not treat prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants any differently; defendants should be \xe2\x80\x9cencouraged to litigate [meritorious copyright defenses] to the same extent that plaintiffs are encouraged to litigate meritorious claims of infringement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 527.  In addition, we noted with approval \xe2\x80\x9cseveral nonexclusive factors\xe2\x80\x9d to inform a court\xe2\x80\x99s fee-shifting decisions: \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness[,] and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 534, n. 19.  And we<i> </i>left open the possibility of providing further guidance in the future, in response to (and grounded on) lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 evolving experience.  See <i>id.,</i> at 534\xe2\x80\x93535; <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Franklin Capital Corp.</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132\n, n. (2005) (noting that <i>Fogerty </i>was not intended to be the end of the matter).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties here, though sharing some common ground, now dispute what else we should say to district courts.  Both Kirtsaeng and Wiley agree\xe2\x80\x94as they must\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa7505 grants courts wide latitude to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based on the totality of circumstances in a case.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for Respondent 35.  Yet both reject the position, taken by some Courts of Appeals, see <i>supra,</i> at 3, n.\xc2\xa01, that <i>Fogerty </i>spelled out the only appropriate limits on judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x94in other words, that each district court should otherwise proceed as it sees fit, assigning whatever weight to whatever factors it chooses.  Rather, Kirtsaeng and Wiley both call, in almost identical language, for \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hanneling district court discretion towards the purposes of the Copyright Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 16; see Brief for Respondent 21 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n appellate court [should] channel a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion so that it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. further[s] the goals of the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x9d).  (And indeed, as discussed later, both describe those purposes identically.  See <i>infra,</i> at 6.)  But at that point, the two part ways.  Wiley argues that giving substantial weight to the reasonableness of a losing party\xe2\x80\x99s position will best serve the Act\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  See Brief for Respondent 24\xe2\x80\x9335.  By contrast, Kirtsaeng favors giving special consideration to whether a lawsuit resolved an important and close legal issue and thus \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfully clarifie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d copyright law.  Brief for Petitioner 36; see <i>id.,</i> at 41\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We join both parties in seeing a need for some additional guidance respecting the application of \xc2\xa7505.  In addressing other open-ended fee-shifting statutes, this Court has emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cin a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Flight Attendants</i> v. <i>Zipes</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 754,\n758 (1989)\n; see <i>Halo Electronics, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pulse Electronics, Inc.</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 8.  Without governing standards or principles, such provisions threaten to condone judicial \xe2\x80\x9cwhim\xe2\x80\x9d or predilection.  <i>Martin</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 139; see also <i>ibid. </i>(\xe2\x80\x9c[A] motion to [a court\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Burr</i>, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.))).  At the least, utterly freewheeling inquiries often deprive litigants of \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Martin</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 139\xe2\x80\x94as when, for example, one judge thinks the parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cmotivation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d determinative and another believes the need for \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d trumps all else, <i>Fogerty</i>, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534, n. 19.  And so too, such unconstrained discretion prevents individuals from predicting how fee decisions will turn out, and thus from making properly informed judgments about whether to litigate.  For those reasons, when applying fee-shifting laws with \xe2\x80\x9cno explicit limit or condition,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Halo, ante</i>, at 8,<i> </i>we have nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cfound limits\xe2\x80\x9d in them\xe2\x80\x94and we have done so, just as both parties urge, by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe large objectives of the relevant Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Zipes</i>, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 759 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>supra,</i> at 5.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In accord with such precedents, we must consider if either Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s or Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s proposal well advances the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s goals.  Those objectives are well settled.  As <i>Fogerty </i>explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccopyright law ultimately serves the purpose of enriching the general public through access to creative works.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527; see U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute achieves that end by striking a balance between two subsidiary aims: encouraging and rewarding authors\xe2\x80\x99 creations while also enabling others to build on that work.  See <i>Fogerty</i>, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 526.  Accordingly, fee awards under \xc2\xa7505 should encourage the types of lawsuits that promote those purposes.  (That is why, for example, <i>Fogerty </i>insisted on treating prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants alike\xe2\x80\x94because the one could \xe2\x80\x9cfurther the policies of the Copyright Act every bit as much as\xe2\x80\x9d the other.  510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527<i>.</i>)  On that much, both parties agree.  Brief for Petitioner 37; Brief for Respondent 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  The contested issue is whether giving substantial weight to the objective (un)reasonableness of a losing party\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position\xe2\x80\x94or, alternatively, to a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x99s role in settling significant and uncertain legal issues\xe2\x80\x94will predictably encourage such useful copyright litigation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The objective-reasonableness approach that Wiley favors passes that test because it both encourages parties with strong legal positions to stand on their rights and deters those with weak ones from proceeding with litigation.  When a litigant\xe2\x80\x94whether plaintiff or defendant\xe2\x80\x94is clearly correct, the likelihood that he will recover fees from the opposing (<i>i.e., </i>unreasonable) party gives him an incentive to litigate the case all the way to the end.  The holder of a copyright that has obviously been infringed has good reason to bring and maintain a suit even if the damages at stake are small; and likewise, a person defending against a patently meritless copyright claim has every incentive to keep fighting, no matter that attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a pro-tracted suit might be as or more costly than a settlement.  Conversely, when a person (again, whether plaintiff or defendant) has an unreasonable litigating position, the likelihood that he will have to pay two sets of fees discourages legal action.  The copyright holder with no reasonable infringement claim has good reason not to bring suit in the first instance (knowing he cannot force a settlement and will have to proceed to judgment); and the infringer with no reasonable defense has every reason to give in quickly, before each side\xe2\x80\x99s litigation costs mount.  All of those results promote the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, by enhancing the probability that both creators and users (<i>i.e., </i>potential plaintiffs and defendants) will enjoy the substantive rights the statute provides.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would not produce any sure benefits.  We accept his premise that litigation of close cases can help ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthe boundaries of copyright law [are] demarcated as clearly as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d thus advancing the public interest in creative work.  Brief for Petitioner 19 (quoting <i>Fogerty</i>, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527).  But we cannot agree that fee-shifting will necessarily, or even usually, encourage parties to litigate those cases to judgment.  Fee awards are a double-edged sword: They increase the reward for a victory\xe2\x80\x94but also enhance the penalty for a defeat.  And the hallmark of hard cases is that no party can be confident if he will win or lose.  That means Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s approach could just as easily discourage as encourage parties to pursue the kinds of suits that \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfully clarif[y]\xe2\x80\x9d copyright law.  Brief for Petitioner 36.  It would (by definition) raise the stakes of such suits; but whether those higher stakes would provide an incentive\xe2\x80\x94or instead a disincentive\xe2\x80\x94to litigate hinges on a party\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward risk.  Is the person risk-preferring or risk-averse\xe2\x80\x94a high-roller or a penny-ante type?  Only the former would litigate more in Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s world.  See Posner, An Economic Approach to Legal Procedure and Judicial Administration, 2 J. Legal Studies 399, 428 (1973) (fees \xe2\x80\x9cmake[\xc2\xa0] the expected value of litigation less for risk-averse litigants, which will encourage [them to] settle[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Kirtsaeng offers no reason to think that serious gamblers predominate.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Texas Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Radcliff Materials, Inc.</i>,\n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630\n, n.\xc2\xa08 (1981) (\xe2\x80\x9cEconomists disagree over whether business decisionmakers[\xc2\xa0] are \xe2\x80\x98risk averse\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>CIGNA Corp.</i> v. <i>Amara</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421,\n430 (2011)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ost individuals are risk averse\xe2\x80\x9d).  So the value of his standard, unlike Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s, is entirely speculative.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What is more, Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s approach is more administrable than Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s.  A district court that has ruled on the merits of a copyright case can easily assess whether the losing party advanced an unreasonable claim or defense.  That is closely related to what the court has already done: In deciding any case, a judge cannot help but consider the strength and weakness of each side\xe2\x80\x99s arguments.  By contrast, a judge may not know at the conclusion of a suit whether a newly decided issue will have, as Kirtsaeng thinks critical, broad legal significance.  The precedent-setting, law-clarifying value of a decision may become apparent only in retrospect\xe2\x80\x94sometimes, not until many years later.  And so too a decision\xe2\x80\x99s practical impact (to the extent Kirtsaeng would have courts separately consider that factor).  District courts are not accustomed to evaluating in real time either the jurisprudential or the on-the-ground import of their rulings.  Exactly how they would do so is uncertain (Kirtsaeng points to no other context in which courts undertake such an analysis), but we fear that the inquiry would implicate our oft-stated concern that an application for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cshould not result in a second major litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Zipes</i>, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 766 (quoting <i>Hensley</i> v. <i>Eckerhart</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424,\n437 (1983)\n).  And we suspect that even at the end of that post-lawsuit lawsuit, the results would typically reflect little more than edu-cated guesses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrary to Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s view, placing substantial weight on objective reasonableness also treats plaintiffs and defendants even-handedly, as <i>Fogerty </i>commands.  No matter which side wins a case, the court must assess whether the other side\xe2\x80\x99s position was (un)reasonable.  And of course, both plaintiffs and defendants can (and sometimes do) make unreasonable arguments.  Kirtsaeng claims that the reasonableness inquiry systematically favors plaintiffs because a losing defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwill virtually <i>always</i> be found to have done something culpable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 29 (emphasis in original).  But that conflates two different questions: whether a defendant in fact infringed a copyright and whether he made serious arguments in defense of his conduct.  Courts every day see reasonable defenses that ultimately fail (just as they see reasonable claims that come to nothing); in this context, as in any other, they are capable of distinguishing between those defenses (or claims) and the objectively unreason-able variety.  And if some court confuses the issue of liability with that of reasonableness, its fee award should be reversed for abuse of discretion.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All of that said, objective reasonableness can be only an important factor in assessing fee applications\xe2\x80\x94not the controlling one.  As we recognized in <i>Fogerty</i>, \xc2\xa7505 con-fers broad discretion on district courts and, in deciding whether to fee-shift, they must take into account a range of considerations beyond the reasonableness of litigating positions.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  That means in any given case a court may award fees even though the losing party offered reasonable arguments (or, conversely, deny fees even though the losing party made unreasonable ones).  For example, a court may order fee-shifting because of a party\xe2\x80\x99s litigation misconduct, whatever the reasonableness of his claims or defenses.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Viva Video, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cabrera</i>, 9 Fed. Appx. 77, 80 (CA2 2001).  Or a court may do so to deter repeated instances of copyright infringement or overaggressive assertions of copyright claims, again even if the losing position was reasonable in a particular case.  See, <i>e.g., Bridgeport Music, Inc.</i> v. <i>WB Music Corp.</i>, 520 F.\xc2\xa03d 588, 593\xe2\x80\x93595 (CA6 2008) (awarding fees against a copyright holder who filed hundreds of suits on an overbroad legal theory, including in a subset of cases in which it was objectively reasonable).  Although objective reasonableness carries significant weight, courts must view all the circumstances of a case on their own terms, in light of the Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s essential goals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And on that score, Kirtsaeng has raised serious questions about how fee-shifting actually operates in the Second Circuit.  To be sure, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 framing of the inquiry resembles our own: It calls for a district court to give \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the reasonableness of a losing party\xe2\x80\x99s litigating positions while also considering other relevant circumstances.  See 605 Fed. Appx., at 49\xe2\x80\x9350; <i>Matthew Bender</i>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 122.  But the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 language at times suggests that a finding of reasonableness raises a presumption against granting fees, see <i>ibid.</i>; <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x94and that goes too far in cabining how a district court must structure its analysis and what it may conclude from its review of relevant factors.  Still more, district courts in the Second Circuit appear to have overly learned the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 lesson, turning \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d into more nearly \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive\xe2\x80\x9d weight.  As Kirtsaeng notes, hardly any decisions in that Circuit have granted fees when the losing party raised a reasonable argument (and none have denied fees when the losing party failed to do so).  See Reply Brief 15.  For these reasons, we vacate the decision below so that the District Court can take another look at Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s fee application.  In sending back the case for this purpose, we do not at all intimate that the District Court should reach a different conclusion.  Rather, we merely ensure that the court will evaluate the motion consistent with the analysis we have set out\xe2\x80\x94giving substantial weight to the reasonableness of Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position, but also taking into account all other relevant factors.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Matthew Bender &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>West Publishing Co.</i>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 122 (CA2 2001) (giving substantial weight to objective reasonableness), with, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Bond</i> v. <i>Blum</i>, 317 F. 3d 385, 397\xe2\x80\x93398 (CA4 2003) (endorsing a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, without according special significance to any factor), and with, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Hogan Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cybersource Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i>, 158 F. 3d 319, 325 (CA5 1998) (presuming that a prevailing party receives fees).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0This case serves as a good illustration.  Imagine you are Kirtsaeng at a key moment in his case\xe2\x80\x94say, when deciding whether to petition this Court for certiorari.  And suppose (as Kirtsaeng now wishes) that the prevailing party in a hard and important case\xe2\x80\x94like this one\xe2\x80\x94will probably get a fee award.  Does that make you more likely to file, because you will recoup your own fees if you win?  Or less likely to file, because you will foot Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s bills if you lose?  Here are some answers to choose from (recalling that you cannot confidently predict which way the Court will rule): (A) Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

According to Kirtsaeng, 86% of winning copyright holders, but only 45% of prevailing defendants, have received fee awards over the last 15 years in the Second Circuit (which, recall, gives substantial weight to objective reasonableness).  See Reply Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9318; <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But first, the Solicitor General represents that the overall numbers are actually 77% and 53%, respectively.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.  And second, the Solicitor General points out that all these percentages include default judgments, which almost invariably give rise to fee awards\xe2\x80\x94but usually of a very small amount\xe2\x80\x94because the defendant has not shown up to oppose either the suit or the fee application.  When those cases are taken out, the statistics look fairly similar: 60% for plaintiffs versus 53% for defendants.  See <i>id.,</i> at 42.  And of course, there may be good reasons why copyright plaintiffs and defendants do not make reasonable arguments in perfectly equal proportion.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
