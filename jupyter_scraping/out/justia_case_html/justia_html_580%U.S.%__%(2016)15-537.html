The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the issue he seeks to shield from reconsideration was actually decided by a prior jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict of acquittal.  <i>Schiro</i> v. <i>Farley</i>,\n\n510 U.

The acquittal, therefore, gains no preclusive effect regarding the count of conviction.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,\n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57\n\xe2\x80\x9369.  Issue preclusion does, however, attend a jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict of acquittal if the same jury in the same proceeding fails to reach a verdict on a different count turning on the same issue of ultimate fact.  <i>Yeager</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 110\n\xe2\x80\x93122. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In this case, a jury convicted petitioners Juan Bravo-Fernandez (Bravo) and Hector Mart\xc3\xadnez-Maldonado (Mart\xc3\xadnez) of bribery in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7666.  Simultaneously, the jury acquitted them of conspiring to violate \xc2\xa7666 and traveling in interstate commerce to violate \xc2\xa7666.  Because the only contested issue at trial was whether Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez had violated \xc2\xa7666 (the other elements of the acquitted charges\xe2\x80\x94agreement and travel\xe2\x80\x94were undisputed), the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdicts were irreconcilably inconsistent.  Unlike the guilty verdicts in <i>Powell</i>, however, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions were later vacated on appeal because of error in the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions unrelated to the verdicts\xe2\x80\x99 inconsistency.  In the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa7666 proscribes only <i>quid pro quo </i>bribery, yet the charge had permitted the jury to find petitioners guilty on a gratuity theory.  On remand, Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez moved for judgments of acquittal on the standalone \xc2\xa7666 charges.  They argued that the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the Government from retrying them on those charges because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating \xc2\xa7666 when it acquitted them of the related conspiracy and Travel Act offenses.  The District Court denied the motions, and the First Circuit affirmed, holding that the eventual invalidation of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7666 convictions did not undermine <i>Powell</i>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that issue preclusion does not apply when the same jury returns logically inconsistent verdicts. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Government from retrying defendants, like petitioners, after a jury has returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal and the convictions are later vacated for legal error unrelated to the inconsistency.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts, petitioners cannot establish that the jury necessarily resolved in their favor the question whether they violated \xc2\xa7666.  In view of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to obtain review of the acquittals, <i>Powell</i>, 469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 68, the inconsistent jury findings weigh heavily against according those acquittals issue-preclusive effect.  The subsequent vacatur of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 bribery convictions does not alter this analysis.  The critical inquiry is whether the jury actually decided that petitioners did not violate \xc2\xa7666.  <i>Ashe </i>instructs courts to approach that task with \xe2\x80\x9crealism and rationality,\xe2\x80\x9d 397 U. S., at 444, in particular, to examine the trial record \xe2\x80\x9cwith an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdicts convicting petitioners of violating \xc2\xa7666 remain relevant to this practical inquiry, even if the convictions are later vacated on appeal for unrelated trial error.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Petitioners could not be retried if the Court of Appeals had vacated their \xc2\xa7666 bribery convictions because of insufficient evidence, see <i>Burks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9311, or if the trial error could resolve the apparent inconsistency in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdicts.  But the evidence here was sufficient to convict petitioners on the <i>quid pro quo </i>bribery<i> </i>theory the First Circuit approved.  And the instructional error cannot account for the jury\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent determinations, for the error applied equally to every \xc2\xa7666-related count.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that vacated judgments should be excluded from the <i>Ashe </i>inquiry because vacated convictions, like the hung counts in <i>Yeager</i>, are legal nullities that \xe2\x80\x9chave never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yeager</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 124.  That argument misapprehends the <i>Ashe</i> inquiry.  Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez bear the burden of showing that the issue whether they violated \xc2\xa7666 has been \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined by a valid and final judgment of acquittal.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To judge whether they carried that burden, a court must realistically examine the record to identify the ground for the \xc2\xa7666-based <i>acquittals</i>.  <i>Ashe</i>, 397 U. S., at 444.  A conviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly relevant to that determination, no less so simply because it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated legal error.  See <i>Powell</i>, 469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Petitioners further contend that, under <i>Yeager,</i> the \xc2\xa7666 convictions are meaningless because the jury was allowed to convict on the basis of conduct not criminal in the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x94payment of a gratuity.  But <i>Yeager</i> did not rest on a court\xe2\x80\x99s inability to detect the basis for a decision the jury in fact rendered.  Rather, when a jury hangs, there is <i>no decision</i>, hence no inconsistency.  557 U. S., at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  By contrast, a verdict of guilt <i>is</i> a jury decision, even if subsequently vacated, and therefore can evince jury inconsistency.  That is the case here.  Petitioners gained a second trial on the standalone bribery charges, but they are not entitled to more.  Issue preclusion is not a doctrine they can commandeer when inconsistent verdicts shroud in mystery what the jury necessarily decided.

In such a case, this Court has held, both verdicts stand.  The Government is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause from challenging the acquittal, see <i>Green</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n355 U.\xc2\xa0S. 184,\n188 (1957)\n, but because the verdicts are rationally irreconcilable, the acquittal gains no preclusive effect, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,\n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57,\n68 (1984)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Does issue preclusion attend a jury\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal verdict if the same jury in the same proceeding fails to reach a verdict on a different count turning on the same critical issue?

As \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no way to decipher what a hung count represents,\xe2\x80\x9d we reasoned, a jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to decide \xe2\x80\x9chas no place in the issue-preclusion analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>id.</i>, at 125 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he fact that a jury hangs is evidence of nothing\xe2\x80\x94other than, of course, that it has failed to decide anything.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the case before us, the jury returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal.  Without more, <i>Powell</i> would control.  There could be no retrial of charges that yielded acquittals but, in view of the inconsistent verdicts, the acquittals would have no issue-preclusive effect on charges that yielded convictions.  In this case, however, unlike <i>Powell</i>, the guilty verdicts were vacated on appeal because of error in the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions unrelated to the verdicts\xe2\x80\x99 inconsistency.  Petitioners urge that, just as a jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to decide has no place in issue-preclusion analysis, so vacated guilty verdicts should not figure in that analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We hold otherwise.  One cannot know from the jury\xe2\x80\x99s report why it returned no verdict.  \xe2\x80\x9cA host of reasons\xe2\x80\x9d could account for a jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to decide\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csharp dis-agreement, confusion about the issues, exhaustion after a long trial, to name but a few.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yeager</i>, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121.  But actual inconsistency in a jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdicts is a reality; vacatur of a conviction for unrelated legal error does not reconcile the jury\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent returns.  We therefore bracket this case with <i>Powell</i>, not <i>Yeager</i>, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which held that issue preclusion does not apply when verdict inconsistency renders unanswerable \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the jury necessarily decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d 41, 47 (CA1 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The doctrine of claim preclusion instructs that a final judgment on the merits \xe2\x80\x9cforeclos[es] successive litigation of the very same claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>New Hampshire</i> v. <i>Maine</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742,\n748 (2001)\n; see Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa719, p. 161 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement).

Although it is impos-sible to discern which verdict the jurors arrived at rationally, we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Powell</i>, 469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (quoting <i>Dunn</i>, 284 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393).  In the event of inconsistent verdicts, we pointed out, it is just as likely that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on [one count], and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the [related] offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Powell</i>, 469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65.  Because a court would be at a loss to know which verdict the jury \xe2\x80\x9creally meant,\xe2\x80\x9d we reasoned, principles of issue preclusion are not useful, for they are \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally and found certain facts in reaching its verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 68.  Holding that the acquittals had no preclusive effect on the counts of conviction, we reaffirmed <i>Dunn</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rule, under which both Powell\xe2\x80\x99s convictions and her acquittals, albeit inconsistent, remained undisturbed.  469 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 69.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, in <i>Yeager</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 110 (2009)\n, we clarified that <i>Powell</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on inconsistent verdicts does not extend to an apparent inconsistency between a jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict of acquittal on one count and its inability to reach a verdict on another count.  See 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 124 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]nconsistent <i>verdicts</i>\xe2\x80\x9d present an \xe2\x80\x9centirely different context\xe2\x80\x9d than one involving \xe2\x80\x9cboth <i>verdicts</i> and seemingly inconsistent <i>hung counts</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yeager was tried on charges of fraud and insider trading.  <i>Id.</i>, at 114.  The jury acquitted him of the fraud offenses, which the Court of Appeals concluded must have reflected a finding that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have any insider information that contradicted what was presented to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 116.  Yet the jury failed to reach a verdict on the insider-trading charges, as to which \xe2\x80\x9cthe possession of insider information was [likewise] a critical issue of ultimate fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 123.  Arguing that the jury had therefore acted inconsistently, the Government sought to retry Yeager on the hung counts.  We ruled that retrial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A jury \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks only through its verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d we noted.  <i>Id.</i>, at 121.  Any number of reasons\xe2\x80\x94including confusion about the issues and sheer exhaustion, we observed\xe2\x80\x94could cause a jury to hang.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accordingly, we said, only \xe2\x80\x9ca jury\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, not its failures to decide,\xe2\x80\x9d identify \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a jury necessarily determined at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 122.  Because a hung count reveals nothing more than a jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reach a decision, we further reasoned, it supplies no evidence of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s irrationality.  <i>Id.</i>, at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  Hung counts, we therefore held, \xe2\x80\x9cha[ve] no place in the issue-preclusion analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 122: When a jury acquits on one count while failing to reach a verdict on another count concerning the same issue of ultimate fact, the acquittal, and only the acquittal, counts for preclusion purposes.

The prosecution stemmed from an alleged bribe paid by petitioner Juan Bravo-Fernandez (Bravo), an entrepreneur, to petitioner Hector Mart\xc3\xadnez-Maldonado (Mart\xc3\xadnez), then a senator serving the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The alleged bribe took the form of an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, including a $1,000 seat at a professional boxing match featuring a popular Puerto Rican contender.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Fernandez</i>, 722 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 6 (CA1 2013).  According to the Government, Bravo intended the bribe to secure Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99 help in shepherding legislation through the Puerto Rico Senate that, if enacted, would \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] substantial financial benefits\xe2\x80\x9d to Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In the leadup to the Las Vegas trip, Mart\xc3\xadnez submitted the legislation for the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s consideration and issued a committee report supporting it; within a week of returning from Las Vegas, Mart\xc3\xadnez issued another favorable report and voted to enact the legislation.  <i>Id.</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on these events, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted petitioners for, <i>inter alia</i>, federal-program bribery, in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7666; conspiracy to violate \xc2\xa7666, in violation of \xc2\xa7371; and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of \xc2\xa7666, in violation of the Travel Act, \xc2\xa71952(a)(3)(A).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Following a three-week trial, a jury convicted Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez of the standalone \xc2\xa7666 bribery offense, but acquitted them of the related conspiracy and Travel Act charges.  <i>Fernandez</i>, 722 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 7.<i> </i>Each received a sentence of 48 months in prison.  <i>Id.</i>, at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the \xc2\xa7666 convictions for instructional error.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27.  In the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, the jury had been erroneously charged on what constitutes criminal conduct under that statute.  <i>Id.</i>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9327.  The charge permitted the jury to find Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez \xe2\x80\x9cguilty of offering and receiving a gratuity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 16, but, the appeals court held, \xc2\xa7666 proscribes only <i>quid pro quo</i> bribes, and not gratuities,<i> id.</i>, at 6, 22.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  True, the court acknowledged, the jury was instructed on both theories of bribery, and the evidence at trial sufficed to support a guilty verdict on either theory.  <i>Id.</i>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.

They could not be retried on the bribery offense, they insisted, because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating \xc2\xa7666 when it acquitted them of conspiring to violate \xc2\xa7666 and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of \xc2\xa7666.  <i>Id.,</i> at 193. <i> </i>That was so, petitioners maintained, because the only contested issue at trial was whether Bravo had offered, and Mart\xc3\xadnez had accepted, a bribe within the meaning of \xc2\xa7666.  <i>Id.</i>, at 196; see Tr.of Oral Arg. 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no dispute that they agreed to go to a boxing match together\xe2\x80\x9d; nor was there any dispute \xe2\x80\x9cthat to get to Las Vegas from Puerto Rico, you have to travel\xe2\x80\x9d across state lines.).

The jury received the same bribery instructions for each count involving \xc2\xa7666, the court noted, so the \xc2\xa7666-based verdicts\xe2\x80\x94convicting on the standalone bribery charges but acquitting on the related Travel Act and conspiracy counts\xe2\x80\x94could not be reconciled.  <i>Id.</i>, at 54\xe2\x80\x9355.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the eventual invalidation of the bribery convictions rendered <i>Powell</i>\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent-verdicts rule inapplicable.  <i>Ashe</i>,<i> </i>the court reminded, calls for a practical appraisal based on the complete record of the prior proceeding; the \xc2\xa7666 bribery convictions, like the \xc2\xa7666-based acquittals, were part of that record.  See 790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50.  Nor are vacated convictions like hung counts for issue-preclusion purposes, the court continued.  Informed by our decision in <i>Yeager</i>, the First Circuit recognized that a hung count reveals only a jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to decide, and therefore cannot evidence actual inconsistency with a jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  In contrast, the court said, vacated convictions \xe2\x80\x9c<i>are </i>jury decisions, through which the jury <i>has </i>spoken.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 51.  The later upset of a conviction on an unrelated ground, the court reasoned, does not undermine <i>Powell</i>\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent verdicts make it impossible to determine what a jury necessarily decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 51.

The ordinary consequence of vacatur, if the Government so elects, is a new trial shorn of the error that infected the first trial.  This \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing jeopardy\xe2\x80\x9d rule neither gives effect to the vacated judgment nor offends double jeopardy principles.  Rather, it reflects the reality that the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal proceedings against an accused have not run their full course.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And by permitting a new trial post vacatur, the continuing-jeopardy rule serves both society\xe2\x80\x99s and criminal defendants\xe2\x80\x99 interests in the fair administration of justice.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a high price indeed for society to pay,\xe2\x80\x9d we have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cwere every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Tateo</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463,\n466 (1964)\n.  And the rights of criminal defendants would suffer too, for \xe2\x80\x9cit is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez ask us to deviate from the general rule that, post vacatur of a conviction, a new trial is in order.

But, as we have explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 7, a defendant cannot meet that burden where the trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts on the issue the defendant seeks to insulate from relitigation.  Here, the jury convicted Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez of violating \xc2\xa7666 but acquitted them of conspiring, and traveling with the intent, to violate \xc2\xa7666.  The convictions and acquittals are irreconcilable because other elements of the Travel Act and conspiracy counts were not disputed.

The critical inquiry is whether the jury actually decided that Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez did not violate \xc2\xa7666.  <i>Ashe </i>counsels us to approach that task with \xe2\x80\x9crealism and rationality,\xe2\x80\x9d 397 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444, in particular, to examine the trial record \xe2\x80\x9cwith an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  As the Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact [that] the jury .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. convicted [Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez] of violating \xc2\xa7666 would seem to be of quite obvious relevance\xe2\x80\x9d to this practical inquiry, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the convictions were later vacated.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50.  Because issue preclusion \xe2\x80\x9cdepends on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the facts in light of the charges as presented at trial,\xe2\x80\x9d a conviction overturned on appeal is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriately considered in our assessment of [an acquittal] verdict\xe2\x80\x99s preclusive effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Citron</i>, 853 F.\xc2\xa02d 1055, 1061 (CA2 1988).  Indeed, the jurors in this case might not have acquitted on the Travel Act and conspiracy counts absent their belief that the \xc2\xa7666 bribery convictions would stand.  See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bravo and Mart\xc3\xadnez could not be retried on the bribery counts, of course, if the Court of Appeals had vacated their \xc2\xa7666 convictions because there was insufficient evidence to support those convictions.  For double jeopardy purposes, a court\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the evidence as insufficient to convict is equivalent to an acquittal and therefore bars a second prosecution for the same offense.  See <i>Burks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9311 (1978); cf. <i>Powell</i>, 469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 67 (noting that defendants are \xe2\x80\x9cafforded protection against jury irrationality or error by [courts\xe2\x80\x99] independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).

Quite the opposite.  The evidence presented at petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, the Court of Appeals determined, supported a guilty verdict on the gratuity theory (which the First Circuit ruled impermissible) <i>as well as</i> the <i>quid pro quo</i> theory (which the First Circuit approved).  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 44.  Vacatur was compelled for the sole reason that the First Circuit found the jury charge erroneous to the extent that it encompassed gratuities.  See <i>supra,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Therefore, the general rule of \xe2\x80\x9callowing a new trial to rectify trial error\xe2\x80\x9d applied.  <i>Burks</i>, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 14 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor, as the Government acknowledges, would retrial be tolerable if the trial error could resolve the apparent inconsistency in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdicts.  See Brief for United States 30 (If, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca jury receives an erroneous instruction on the count of conviction but the correct instruction on the charge on which it acquits, the instructional error may reconcile the verdicts.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the instructional error here cannot account for the jury\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory determinations because the error applied equally to every \xc2\xa7666-related count.
