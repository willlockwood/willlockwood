CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In the present case a majority of the Court is of opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction in the case, the value in controversy not being sufficient to entitle the party by law to claim an appeal.  The value is not the value of the minor\'s estate, but the value of the office of guardian.  The present is a controversy merely between persons claiming adversely as guardians, having no distinct interest of their own.  The office of guardian is of no value except so far as it affords a compensation for labor and services thereafter to be earned.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
