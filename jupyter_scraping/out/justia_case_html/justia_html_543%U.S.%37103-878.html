Here, Martinez, respondent in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, and Benitez, petitioner in No. 03\xe2\x80\x937434, Cuban nationals who are both inadmissible under \xc2\xa71182, were ordered removed, but were detained beyond the 90-day removal period.  Each filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his continued detention.  In Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court found that removal was not reasonably foreseeable and ordered that Martinez be released under appropriate conditions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In Benitez\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court also accepted that removal would not occur in the foreseeable future, but nonetheless denied the petition.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa71231(a)(6), the Secretary may detain inadmissible aliens beyond the 90-day removal period, but only for so long as is reasonably necessary to achieve removal.  Section 1231(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s operative language, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be detained beyond the removal period,\xe2\x80\x9d applies equally to all aliens that are its subject, whether or not those aliens have been admitted to the country.  In Zadvydas</em> v. <em>Davis, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/678/index.html">533 U. S. 678</a>, this Court interpreted \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to authorize the detention of aliens who have been admitted to the country only as long as \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to effectuate their removal.  <em>Id.,</em> at 689, 699.  This interpretation must apply to inadmissible aliens as well.  Even if the statutory purpose and constitutional concerns influencing the <em>Zadvydas</em> construction are not present for inadmissible aliens, that cannot justify giving the <em>same</em> statutory text a different meaning depending on the characteristics of the aliens involved.  <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U.

Moreover, contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, nothing in <em>Zadvydas</em> indicates that \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.  Nor does \xc2\xa71182(d)(5) independently authorize continued detention of these aliens.

S., at 701<em>.</em>  The Government having suggested no reason that the time reasonably necessary for removal is longer for an inadmissible alien, this same 6-month presumptive detention period applies in these cases.<em> </em>Because both Martinez and Benitez were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final, the Government has brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists, and the District Court in each case has determined that removal to Cuba is not reasonably foreseeable, the habeas petitions should have been granted.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(d)(5).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, p.\xc2\xa07; <em>Benitez </em>v. <em>Wallis</em>,<em> </em>337 F.\xc2\xa03d 1289, 1290 (CA11 2003).

See Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act, 80 Stat. 1161, as amended, notes following 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71255.  Neither Martinez nor Benitez qualified for this adjustment, however, because, by the time they applied, both men had become inadmissible because of prior criminal convictions in the United States.  When Martinez sought adjustment in 1991, he had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Rhode Island and burglary in California, Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, at\xc2\xa07; when Benitez sought adjustment in 1985, he had been convicted of grand theft in Florida, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1290.  Both men were convicted of additional felonies after their adjustment applications were denied: Martinez of petty theft with a prior conviction (1996), assault with a deadly weapon (1998), and attempted oral copulation by force (1999), see Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, at\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938; Benitez of two counts of armed robbery, armed burglary of a conveyance, armed burglary of a structure, aggravated battery, carrying a concealed firearm, unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense, and unlawful possession, sale, or delivery of a firearm with an altered serial number (1993), see 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1290\xe2\x80\x931291.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Attorney General revoked Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s parole in December 2000.  Martinez was taken into custody by the INS, and removal proceedings were commenced against him.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, at\xc2\xa08.  An Immigration Judge found him inadmissible by reason of his prior convictions, \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(B), and lack of sufficient documentation, \xc2\xa71182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and ordered him removed to Cuba.  Martinez did not appeal.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, at\xc2\xa08.  The INS continued to detain him after expiration of the 90-day removal period, and he remained in custody until he was released pursuant to the District Court order that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision on review here.  <em>Id</em>., at\xc2\xa09. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Benitez\xe2\x80\x99s parole was revoked in 1993 (shortly after he was imprisoned for his convictions of that year), and the INS immediately initiated removal proceedings against him.  In December 1994, an Immigration Judge determined Benitez to be excludable and ordered him deported under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(B) and 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1291.  Benitez did not seek further review.  At the completion of his state prison term, the INS took him into custody for removal, and he continued in custody after expiration of the 90-day removal period.  <em>Ibid. </em> In September 2003, Benitez received notification that he was eligible for parole, contingent on his completion of a drug-abuse treatment program.  Letter from Paul D. Clement, Acting Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court, 1 (Nov. 3, 2004).  Benitez completed the program while his case was pending before this Court, and shortly after completion was paroled for a period of one year.  <em>Ibid</em>.

In Benitez\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court for the Northern District of Florida also concluded that removal would not occur in the \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeable future,\xe2\x80\x9d but nonetheless denied the petition.  <em>Benitez </em>v. <em>Wallis</em>, Case No. 5:02cv19 MMP (July 11, 2002), pp.\xc2\xa02, 4, App. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x937434, pp. 45, 48.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the [Secretary] to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nBy its terms, this provision applies to three categories of aliens: (1) those ordered removed who are inadmissible under \xc2\xa71182, (2) those ordered removed who are removable under \xc2\xa71227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4), and (3) those ordered removed whom the Secretary determines to be either a risk to the community or a flight risk.  In <em>Zadvydas </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/678/index.html">533 U. S. 678</a> (2001), the Court interpreted this provision to authorize the Attorney General (now the Secretary) to detain aliens in the second category only as long as \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to remove them from the country.  <em>Id</em>., at 689, 699.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court said, \xe2\x80\x9csuggests discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily . . . unlimited discretion.  In that respect, the word \xe2\x80\x98may\xe2\x80\x99 is ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at<em> </em>697.  In light of that perceived ambiguity and the \xe2\x80\x9cserious constitutional threat\xe2\x80\x9d the Court believed to be posed by indefinite detention of aliens who had been admitted to the country, <em>id.</em>, at 699, the Court interpreted the statute to permit only detention that is related to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbasic purpose [of] effectuating an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 696\xe2\x80\x93699.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 699.  The Court further held that the presumptive period during which the detention of an alien is reasonably necessary to effectuate his removal is six months; after that, the alien is eligible for conditional release if he can demonstrate that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 701<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented by these cases, and the question that evoked contradictory answers from the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, is whether this construction of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) that we applied to the second category of aliens covered by the statute applies as well to the first\xe2\x80\x94that is, to the category of aliens \xe2\x80\x9cordered removed who are inadmissible under [\xc2\xa7]1182.\xe2\x80\x9d  We think the answer must be yes.  The operative language of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6), \xe2\x80\x9cmay be detained beyond the removal period,\xe2\x80\x9d applies without differentiation to all three categories of aliens that are its subject.  To give these same words a different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one.  As the Court in <em>Zadvydas </em>recognized, the statute can be construed \xe2\x80\x9cliterally\xe2\x80\x9d to authorize indefinite detention, <em>id.</em>, at 689, or (as the Court ultimately held) it can be read to \xe2\x80\x9csuggest [less than] unlimited discretion\xe2\x80\x9d to detain, <em>id</em>., at 697.  It cannot, however, be interpreted to do both at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s belief that <em>Zadvydas</em> compels this result rests primarily on that case\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]liens who have not yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different question,\xe2\x80\x9d 533 U. S., at 682.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 6 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  This mistakes the reservation of a question with its answer.  Neither the opinion of the Court nor the dissent in <em>Zadvydas </em>so much as hints that the Court adopted the novel interpretation of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) proposed by today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.  The opinion in that case considered whether \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) permitted the Government to detain removable aliens indefinitely; relying on ambiguities in the statutory text and the canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid constitutional doubts, the opinion held that it did not.  Despite the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s repeated claims that \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) could not be given a different reading for inadmissible aliens, see <em>Zadvydas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 710, 716\xe2\x80\x93717, the Court <em>refused to decide</em> that question\xe2\x80\x94the question we answer today.  It is indeed different from the question decided in <em>Zadvydas</em>, but because the statutory text provides for no distinction between admitted and nonadmitted aliens, we find that it results in the same answer.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that our reading of<em> Zadvydas </em>is \xe2\x80\x9cimplausible,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 2, is hard to reconcile with the fact that it is the identical reading espoused by the <em>Zadvydas </em>dissenters, who included the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.  Worse still, what the <em>Zadvydas </em>dissent <em>did</em> find \xe2\x80\x9cnot . . . plausible\xe2\x80\x9d was precisely the reading adopted by today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he majority\xe2\x80\x99s logic might be that inadmissible and removable aliens can be treated differently.  Yet it is not a plausible construction of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to imply a time limit as to one class but not to another.  The text does not admit of this possibility.  As a result, it is difficult to see why \xe2\x80\x98[a]liens who have not yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zadvydas</em>, 533 U. S., at 710\xe2\x80\x93711 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). </p>\n<p>\n\nThe <em>Zadvydas</em> dissent later concluded that the release of \xe2\x80\x9cMariel Cubans and other illegal, inadmissible aliens . . . would seem <em>a necessary consequence of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 717 (emphasis added).  Tellingly, the <em>Zadvydas</em> majority did not negate either charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, joined by the dissent, argues that the statutory purpose and the constitutional concerns that influenced our statutory construction in <em>Zadvydas </em>are not present for aliens, such as Martinez and Benitez, who have not been admitted to the United States.  Be that as it may, it cannot justify giving the <em>same</em> detention provision a different meaning when such aliens are involved.  It is not at all unusual to give a statute\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications, even though other of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.  The lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 543 U.

In other words, when deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice.  If one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail\xe2\x80\x94whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to the particular litigant before the Court.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent takes issue with this maxim of statutory construction on the ground that it allows litigants to \xe2\x80\x9cattack statutes as constitutionally invalid based on constitutional doubts concerning other litigants or factual circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby to effect an \xe2\x80\x9cend run around black-letter constitutional doctrine governing facial and as-applied constitutional challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 10.  This accusation misconceives\xe2\x80\x94and fundamentally so\xe2\x80\x94the role played by the canon of constitutional avoidance in statutory interpretation.  The canon is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/490/index.html">440 U. S. 490</a>, 502 (1979) (refusing to engage in extended analysis in the process of applying the avoidance canon \xe2\x80\x9cas we would were we considering the constitutional issue\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Vermeule, Saving Constructions, 85 Geo. L.\xc2\xa0J. 1945, 1960\xe2\x80\x931961 (1997) (providing examples of cases where the Court construed a statute narrowly to avoid a constitutional question ultimately resolved in favor of the broader reading).  Indeed, one of the canon\xe2\x80\x99s chief justifications is that it allows courts to <em>avoid</em> the decision of constitutional questions.  It is a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts.    See<em> Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U. S. 173</a>, 191 (1991); <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988).  The canon is thus a means of giving effect to congressional intent, not of subverting it.  And when a litigant invokes the canon of avoidance, he is not attempting to vindicate the constitutional rights of others, as the dissent believes; he seeks to vindicate his own<em> statutory </em>rights.  We find little to recommend the novel interpretive approach advocated by the dissent, which would render every statute a chameleon, its meaning subject to change depending on the presence or absence of constitutional concerns in each individual case.  Cf. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/545/index.html">536 U. S. 545</a>, 556 (2002) (rejecting \xe2\x80\x9ca dynamic view of statutory interpretation, under which the text might mean one thing when enacted yet another if the prevailing view of the Constitution later changed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its contention that we can give \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) a different meaning when it is applied to nonadmitted aliens, the Government relies most prominently upon our decision in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a> (1932).  Brief for Petitioners in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, p.\xc2\xa029; Brief for Respondent in No. 03\xe2\x80\x937434, p. 29.  That case involved a statutory provision that gave the Deputy Commissioner of the United States Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Commission \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d claims under the Longshoremen\xe2\x80\x99s and Harbor Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Act.  285 U. S., at 62.  The question presented was whether this provision precluded review of the Deputy Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the claimant was an employee, and hence covered by the Act.  The Court held that, although the statute could be read to bar judicial review altogether, it was also susceptible of a narrower reading that permitted judicial review of the fact of employment, which was an \xe2\x80\x9cessential condition precedent to the right to make the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court adopted the latter construction in order to avoid serious constitutional questions that it believed would be raised by total preclusion of judicial review.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This holding does <em>not </em>produce a statute that bears two different meanings, depending on the presence or absence of a constitutional question.  Always, and as applied to all claimants, it permits judicial review of the employment finding.  What corresponds to <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding that the fact of employment is judicially reviewable is <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that detention cannot be continued once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable\xe2\x80\x94and like the one, the other applies in all cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent, on the other hand, relies on our recent cases interpreting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(d).  <em>Raygor </em>v. <em>Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/533/index.html">534 U. S. 533</a> (2002), held that this provision does not include, in its tolling of limitations periods, claims against States that have not waived their immunity from suit in federal court, because the statutory language fails to make \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unmistakably clear,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as it must in provisions subjecting States to suit, that such States were covered.  <em>Id</em>., at 543\xe2\x80\x93546.  A subsequent decision, <em>Jinks </em>v. <em>Richland County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/456/index.html">538 U. S. 456</a> (2003), held that the tolling provision <em>does </em>apply to claims against political subdivisions of States, since the requirement of the unmistakably clear statement did not apply to those entities.  <em>Id.</em>, at 466.  This progression of decisions does not remotely establish that \xc2\xa71367(d) has two different meanings, equivalent to the unlimited-detention/limited-detention meanings of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) urged upon us here.  They hold that the single and unchanging disposition of \xc2\xa71367(d) (the tolling of limitations periods) does not apply to claims against States that have not consented to be sued in federal court.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, under <em>Zadvydas</em>, \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) \xe2\x80\x9cauthorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93878, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328; Brief for Respondent in No. 03\xe2\x80\x937434, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  The Government provides no citation to support that description of the case\xe2\x80\x94and none exists.  <em>Zadvydas </em>did not hold that the statute authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits; it held that, <em>since</em> interpreting the statute to authorize indefinite detention (one plausible reading) would approach constitutional limits, the statute should be read (in line with the other plausible reading) to authorize detention only for a period consistent with the purpose of effectuating removal.  533 U. S., at 697\xe2\x80\x93699.  If we were, as the Government seems to believe, free to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d statutes as becoming inoperative when they \xe2\x80\x9capproach constitutional limits,\xe2\x80\x9d we would be able to spare ourselves the necessity of ever<em> </em>finding a statute unconstitutional as applied.  And the doctrine that statutes should be construed to contain substantive dispositions that do not raise constitutional difficulty would be a thing of the past; no need for such caution, since\xe2\x80\x94<em>whatever</em> the substantive dispositions are\xe2\x80\x94they become inoperative when constitutional limits are \xe2\x80\x9capproached.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not the legal world we live in.  The canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as <em>a means</em> of <em>choosing between them</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 237\xe2\x80\x93238 (1998);<em> United States ex rel. Attorney General </em>v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/213/366/index.html">213 U. S. 366</a>, 408 (1909).  In <em>Zadvydas</em>, it was the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text read in light of its purpose, not some implicit statutory command to avoid approaching constitutional limits, which produced the rule that the Secretary may detain aliens only for the period reasonably necessary to bring about their removal.  See 533 U. S., at 697\xe2\x80\x93699.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In passing in its briefs, but more intensively at\noral argument, the Government sought to justify its continued detention of these aliens on the authority of \xc2\xa71182(d)(5)(A).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Even assuming that an alien who is subject to a final order of removal is an \xe2\x80\x9calien applying for admission\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore eligible for parole under this provision, we find nothing in this text that affirmatively authorizes detention, much less indefinite detention.  To the contrary, it provides that, when parole is revoked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien shall . . . be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter <em>his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71182(d)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  The manner in which the case of any other applicant would be \xe2\x80\x9cdealt with\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the 90-day removal period is prescribed by \xc2\xa71231(a)(6), which we interpreted in <em>Zadvydas </em>and have interpreted above.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government fears that the security of our borders will be compromised if it must release into the country inadmissible aliens who cannot be removed.  If that is so, Congress can attend to it.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But for this Court to sanction indefinite detention in the face of <em>Zadvydas</em> would establish within our jurisprudence, beyond the power of Congress to remedy, the dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the Government has suggested no reason why the period of time reasonably necessary to effect removal is longer for an inadmissible alien, the 6-month presumptive detention period we prescribed in <em>Zadvydas</em> applies.  See 533 U. S., at 699\xe2\x80\x93701.  Both Martinez and Benitez were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final.  The Government having brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists despite the passage of six months (indeed, it concedes that it is no longer even involved in repatriation negotiations with Cuba); and the District Court in each case having determined that removal to Cuba is not reasonably foreseeable; the petitions for habeas corpus should have been granted.

S. 52</a> (1997), is perfectly consistent with this principle of construction.  In <em>Salinas</em>, the Court rejected the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the avoidance canon because the text of the statute was \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous on the point under consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 U.

For this reason, the Court squarely addressed and rejected any argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the petitioner.  <em>Id</em>., at 61 (holding that, under the construction adopted by the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute is constitutional as applied in this case\xe2\x80\x9d).    </p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent concedes this is so but argues, <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, that, because the Court reached this conclusion \xe2\x80\x9conly after analyzing whether the constitutional doubts in <em>Raygor</em> applied to the county defendant\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Jinks</em>, <em>post</em>, at 8, we must engage in the same quasi-constitutional analysis here before applying the construction adopted in <em>Zadvydas</em> to the aliens in these cases.  This overlooks a critical distinction between the question before the Court in <em>Jinks</em> and the one before us today.  In <em>Jinks</em>, the county could not claim the aid of <em>Raygor</em> itself because <em>Raygor</em> held only that \xc2\xa71367(d) did not include suits against nonconsenting <em>States</em>; instead, the county argued <em>by analogy</em> <em>to</em> <em>Raygor</em> that, absent a clear statement of congressional intent, \xc2\xa71367(d) should be construed not to include suits against political subdivisions of States.  And thus the Court in <em>Jinks</em> considered not whether <em>Raygor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71367(d) was directly controlling but whether the constitutional concerns that justified the requirement of a clear statement in <em>Raygor</em> applied as well in the case of counties.  In the present cases, by contrast, the aliens ask simply that the interpretation of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) announced in <em>Zadvydas</em> be applied to them.  This question does not compel us to compare analogous constitutional doubts; it simply requires that we determine whether the statute construed by <em>Zadvydas </em>permits any distinction to be drawn between aliens who have been admitted and aliens who have not.  </p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 1182(d)(5)(A) reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe [Secretary] may \xe2\x80\xa6 in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the [Secretary], have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0That Congress has the capacity to do so is demonstrated by its reaction to our decision in <em>Zadvydas</em>.

I write separately to emphasize that, even under the current statutory scheme, it is possible for the Government to detain inadmissible aliens for more than six months after they have been ordered removed.  For one thing, the 6-month presumption we described in <em>Zadvydas </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/678/index.html">533 U. S. 678</a> (2001), is just that\xe2\x80\x94a presumption.  The Court notes that the Government has not suggested here any reason why it takes longer to effect removal of inadmissible aliens than it does to effect removal of other aliens.  It is conceivable, however, that a longer period <em>is</em> \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 689, to effect removal of inadmissible aliens as a class.  If the Government shows that to be true, then detention beyond six months will be lawful within the meaning we ascribed to 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) in <em>Zadvydas</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Government has other statutory means for detaining aliens whose removal is not foreseeable and whose presence poses security risks.  Upon certifying that he has \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds to believe\xe2\x80\x9d an alien has engaged in certain terrorist or other dangerous activity specified by statute, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71226a(a)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. II), the Secretary of Homeland Security may detain that alien for successive six-month periods \xe2\x80\x9cif the release of the alien will threaten the national security of the United States or the safety of the community or any person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71226a(a)(6).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, any alien released as a result of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding remains subject to the conditions of supervised release.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(a)(3); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7241.5 (2004).  And, if he fails to comply with the conditions of release, he will be subject to criminal penalties\xe2\x80\x94including further detention.  See 8 U.

S. 678</a> (2001), this Court construed this provision \xe2\x80\x9cto contain an implicit \xe2\x80\x98reasonable time\xe2\x80\x99 limitation\xe2\x80\x9d on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s power to detain admitted aliens \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ased on our conclusion that indefinite detention of\xe2\x80\x9d those aliens \xe2\x80\x9cwould raise serious constitutional concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 682.  \xe2\x80\x9cAliens who have not yet gained initial admission to this country,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court assured us, \xe2\x80\x9cwould present a very different question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Court holds that this constitutional distinction\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x9cmade all the difference\xe2\x80\x9d to the <em>Zadvydas</em> Court, <em>id.,</em> at 693\xe2\x80\x94is actually irrelevant, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he operative language of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) \xe2\x80\xa6 applies without differentiation to all three categories of aliens that are its subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  While I wholeheartedly agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to the text of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis cannot be squared with <em>Zadvydas</em>.  And even if it could be so squared, <em>Zadvydas</em> was wrongly decided and should be overruled.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin by addressing the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Zadvydas</em>.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not a fair reading of that case.  It is also not required by any sound principle of statutory construction of which I am aware.  To the contrary, what drives the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading is a novel \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d principle. <em> Ante,</em> at 8.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <em>Zadvydas</em> is implausible.  <em>Zadvydas </em>held that interpreting \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to authorize indefinite detention of admitted aliens later found removable would raise serious due process concerns.  533 U. S., at 690\xe2\x80\x93696.  The Court therefore read the statute to permit the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) to detain admitted aliens only as long as reasonably necessary to remove them from the country.  <em>Id.,</em> at 699.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority concedes that <em>Zadvydas </em>explicitly reserved the question whether its statutory holding as to <em>admitted</em> aliens applied equally to <em>inadmissible</em> aliens.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  This reservation was front and center in <em>Zadvydas</em>.  It appeared in the introduction and is worth repeating in full:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn these cases, we must decide whether [\xc2\xa71231(a)(6)] authorizes the Attorney General to detain a removable alien <em>indefinitely</em> beyond the removal period or only for a period <em>reasonably necessary</em> to secure the alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal.  We deal here with aliens who were admitted to the United States but subsequently ordered removed.  Aliens who have not yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different question.  Based on our conclusion that indefinite detention of aliens in the former category would raise serious constitutional concerns, we construe the statute to contain an implicit \xe2\x80\x98reasonable time\xe2\x80\x99 limitation, the application of which is subject to federal-court review.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U. S., at 682 (citation omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court reserved this question because the <em>constitutional</em> questions raised by detaining inadmissible aliens are different from those raised by detaining admitted aliens.  It stated that the detention period in \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) was limited because it \xe2\x80\x9cread [the statute] in light of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 689.  And it repeatedly emphasized constitutional distinctions among various groups of aliens, for which \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) makes no distinctions.  See <em>id.</em>, at 693\xe2\x80\x93694 (noting the different constitutional considerations applicable to inadmissible and admissible aliens); <em>id.</em>, at 695 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe cases before us [do not] require us to consider the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 authority to control entry into the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 696 (noting that the opinion did not \xe2\x80\x9cconsider terrorism or other special circumstances where special arguments might be made for forms of preventive detention and for heightened deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters of national security\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <em>Zadvydas</em> is inconsistent with these qualifications.  If it were true that <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) applied to all aliens regardless of the constitutional concerns involved in each case, then the question of how \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) applies to them would not be \xe2\x80\x9cvery different\xe2\x80\x9d depending on the alien before the Court.  The question would be trivial, because the text of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) plainly does not distinguish between admitted and nonadmitted aliens.  There would also have been no need for the Court to go out of its way to leave aside \xe2\x80\x9cterrorism or other special circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 696, or to disavow \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderat[ion of] the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 authority to control entry into the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 695, for the construction the majority extracts from <em>Zadvydas</em> would have applied across the board, <em>ibid.</em>  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationalization that its construction would therefore \xe2\x80\x9cleave no unprotected spot in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s armor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 695\xe2\x80\x93696 (internal quotation marks omitted), would have been incorrect.  The constitutional distinctions that pervade <em>Zadvydas </em>are evidence that the \xe2\x80\x9cvery different\xe2\x80\x9d statutory question it reserved turned on them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Zadvydas</em> Court thus tethered its reading of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to the specific class of aliens before it.  The term this Court read into the statute was not simply a presumptive 6-month period, but a presumptive 6-month period for admitted aliens.  Its reading of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s demands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 689, that is, depended on the constitutional considerations at work in \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the cases before</em> <em>[it],</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 695 (emphasis added).  One would expect the Court today, then, to follow the same two-step procedure it employed in <em>Zadvydas</em>.  It should first ask whether the statute is ambiguous and, if so, whether one of the possible interpretations raises constitutional doubts as applied to Martinez and Benitez.  Step one is dictated by <em>Zadvydas:</em> \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) is not clear on whether it permits indefinite detention.  The Court should then move to the second step and ask whether either of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s possible interpretations raises constitutional doubts as applied to Benitez and Martinez.  If so, the Court would apply avoidance to adopt the interpretation free from constitutional doubt (as <em>Zadvydas</em> itself did).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for departing from this reading of <em>Zadvydas</em> are unpersuasive.  The Court says that its reading is necessary to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing] one,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6; to preclude \xe2\x80\x9cgiving the <em>same</em> detention provision a different meaning\xe2\x80\x9d depending on the aliens before the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 8 (emphasis in original); and to forestall establishing \xe2\x80\x9cthe dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.  I agree that we should adopt none of these principles, but this is no warrant for the reading of <em>Zadvydas</em> that the majority advocates.  <em>Zadvydas </em>established a single and unchanging, if implausible, meaning of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6): that the detention period authorized by \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) depends not only on the circumstances surrounding a removal, but also on the type of alien ordered removed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I grant that this understanding of <em>Zadvydas </em>could result in different detention periods for different classes of aliens\xe2\x80\x94indefinite detention for some, limited detention for others.  But it does not follow that this reads the meaning of the statute to \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d depending on the alien involved, any more than the meaning of the statute could be said to \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d simply because the time that is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary to effect removal\xe2\x80\x9d may differ depending on the type of alien involved, as both the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 15, and Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 1, concede it may.  A statute\xe2\x80\x99s sense is the same even if what it requires depends on factual context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its reading of <em>Zadvydas</em>, the Court relies on a statement in a dissent in <em>Zadvydas</em> that \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) could not be given a different reading for inadmissible aliens.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (citing 533 U. S., at 710\xe2\x80\x93711, 717 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)).  That dissenting view, as the very quotation the majority stresses demonstrates, rested on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s premise that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not a plausible construction of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to imply a time limit as to one class and not to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 710 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  But the <em>Zadvydas</em> majority disagreed with that assumption and adopted a contrary interpretation of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6).  For as the dissent recognized, <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9clogic might be that inadmissible and removable aliens might be treated differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That was <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 logic precisely, as its repeated statements limiting its decision to inadmissible aliens show.  To interpret <em>Zadvydas </em>properly, we must take its logic as given, not the logic of the <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>of <em>Zadvydas</em> that I joined in dissent. </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority strains to recharacterize <em>Zadvydas</em> because it thinks that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not at all unusual to give a statute\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications, even though other of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  In other words, it claims, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  I disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, this principle is inconsistent with <em>Zadvydas </em>itself.  As explained above, the limiting construction <em>Zadvydas</em> adopted as to admitted aliens does not necessarily govern the other applications of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6).  If the majority is correct that the \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d governs, then the careful distinction <em>Zadvydas</em> drew between admitted aliens and nonadmitted aliens was irrelevant at best and misleading at worst.  Under this reading, <em>Zadvydas</em> would have come out the same way even if it had involved inadmissible aliens, for the \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute remains the same regardless of the identity of the alien before the Court.  Again, this understanding of <em>Zadvydas</em> is implausible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond <em>Zadvydas</em>, the Court offers scant support for the idea that statutes should be stripped down to their \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  It attempts to distinguish <em>Jinks </em>v. <em>Richland County, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/456/index.html">538 U. S. 456</a> (2003), and<em> Raygor </em>v. <em>Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/533/index.html">534 U. S. 533</a> (2002), <em>ante, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, and n. 6, yet these cases employed exactly the procedure that the majority today says is impermissible.  They construed 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(d),[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] a tolling provision, to apply to States and political subdivisions of States only to the extent that doing so would raise a constitutional doubt as applied to either entity.  <em>Jinks </em>was explicit on this point:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we held in <em>[Raygor]</em> that \xc2\xa71367(d) does not apply to claims filed in federal court against <em>States</em> but subsequently dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, we did so to avoid interpreting the statute in a manner that would raise \xe2\x80\x98serious constitutional doubt\xe2\x80\x99 in light of our decisions protecting a <em>State</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em>s</em> sovereign immunity from congressional abrogation \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [N]o such constitutional doubt arises from holding that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim against respondent\xe2\x80\x94which is not a State, but a political subdivision of a State\xe2\x80\x94falls under the definition of \xe2\x80\x98<em>any claim</em> asserted under subsection (a) [of \xc2\xa71367].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  538 U. S., at 466 (citation omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis passage reads the meaning of \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x94which applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany claim asserted under subsection (a)\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71367\xe2\x80\x94to hinge on the constitutional context.  The Court is correct that <em>Jinks </em>and <em>Raygor</em> \xe2\x80\x9chold that the single and unchanging disposition of \xc2\xa71367(d) \xe2\x80\xa6 does not apply to claims against States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But as the Court concedes, <em>Jinks</em> reached that holding only after analyzing whether the constitutional doubts at issue in <em>Raygor</em> applied to the county defendant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, n. 6.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do the same here cannot be reconciled with <em>Jinks</em> and <em>Raygor:</em> the Court should ask whether the constitutional concerns that justified the requirement of a clear statement in <em>Zadvydas</em> apply as well to inadmissible aliens. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d principle is also in tension with <em>Salinas </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/52/index.html">522 U. S. 52</a> (1997).  There, we rejected an argument that the federal bribery statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7666(a)(1)(B), should be construed to avoid constitutional doubts, in part on the ground that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno serious <em>doubt</em> about the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts of this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 U. S., at 60 (emphasis added).  Unlike the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to avoidance today, we disclaimed examination of the constitutionality of applications not before the Court: \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever might be said about \xc2\xa7666(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s application in other cases, the application of \xc2\xa7666(a)(1)(B) did not extend federal power beyond its proper bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 61.  The Court is mistaken that this passage in <em>Salinas</em> was a rejection of a constitutional argument on its merits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9, n. 5.  Salinas, the petitioner, phrased his question presented solely in terms of the proper statutory interpretation of \xc2\xa7666(a)(1)(B), Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1996, No. 96\xe2\x80\x93738, p.\xc2\xa0i, and never claimed that the statute was unconstitutional, see generally <em>ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d principle is inconsistent with the history of the canon of avoidance and is likely to have mischievous consequences.  The modern canon of avoidance is a doctrine under which courts construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional doubts, but this doctrine has its origins in a very different form of the canon.  Traditionally, the avoidance canon was not a doctrine under which courts read statutes to avoid mere constitutional doubts.  Instead, it commanded courts, when faced with two plausible constructions of a statute\xe2\x80\x94one constitutional and the other unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94to choose the constitutional reading.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The traditional version of the canon thus requires courts to reach the issue whether the doubtful version of the statute is constitutional before adopting the construction that saves the statute from constitutional invalidity.  A court faced with an ambiguous statute applies traditional avoidance by asking whether, given two plausible interpretations of that statute, one would be unconstitutional <em>as applied to the plaintiff;</em> and, if that interpretation is actually unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff, the court picks the other (constitutional) reading.  The court does not inquire whether either of the interpretations would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties not before the court, unless the challenge is facial or otherwise implicates third-party rights.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This history suggests that the \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d principle is mistaken.  Courts applying the modern version of the canon of avoidance should no more look to the rights of third parties than do courts using the traditional version.  Under modern avoidance, in other words, an ambiguous statute should be read to avoid a constitutional doubt only if the statute is constitutionally doubtful as applied to the litigant before the court (again, unless the constitutional challenge involves third-party rights).  Yet the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lowest common denominator principle allows a limiting construction of an ambiguous statute prompted by constitutional doubts to infect other applications of the statute\xe2\x80\x94even if the statute raises no constitutional doubt as applied to the specific litigant in a given case and even if the constitutionally unproblematic application of the statute to the litigant is severable from the constitutionally dubious applications.  The lowest common denominator principle thus allows an end run around black-letter constitutional doctrine governing facial and as-applied constitutional challenges to statutes: A litigant ordinarily cannot attack statutes as constitutionally invalid based on constitutional doubts concerning other litigants or factual circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court misses the point by answering that the canon of constitutional avoidance \xe2\x80\x9cis not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the canon rests on a presumption that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  That is true, but in deciding whether a plausible interpretation \xe2\x80\x9craises serious constitutional doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d a court must employ the usual rules of constitutional adjudication.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9 (noting that whether an interpretation is constitutionally doubtful turns on whether it raises \xe2\x80\x9ca multitude of constitutional problems\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Zadvydas</em>, 533 U. S., at 690\xe2\x80\x93696 (extensively employing constitutional analysis).  Those rules include doctrines governing third-party constitutional challenges and the like.  Moreover, the reason that courts perform avoidance at all, in any form, is that we assume \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intends statutes to have effect to the full extent the Constitution allows.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker</em>, <em>ante</em>, at __ (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).  Only my approach would extend \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to its full constitutional bound consistent with modern avoidance, by narrowing the statute on a case-by-case basis only if constitutional concerns are actually present.  By contrast, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s lowest common denominator principle, a statute like \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) must be narrowed once and for all based on constitutional concerns that may never materialize.  In short, once narrowed in <em>Zadvydas</em>, \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) now limits the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s power to detain unadmitted aliens\xe2\x80\x94even though indefinite detention of unadmitted aliens may be perfectly constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of this shows why the sole support the majority offers for its lowest common denominator principle can be squared with my analysis.  That support is a plurality opinion of this Court (reaffirmed by footnote dictum in <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <em>ante,</em> at ___, n.\xc2\xa08), that stated that the rule of lenity applies to statutes so long as they have some criminal applications.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson/Center Arms Co.</em>, 504 U. S.505, 517 (1992)).  To the extent that the rule of lenity is a constitutionally based clear statement rule, it is like vagueness doctrine, as its purpose is to ensure that those subjected to criminal prosecution have adequate notice of the conduct that the law prohibits.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McBoyle</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/25/index.html">283 U. S. 25</a>, 27 (1931).  <em>Thompson/Center Arms</em> is thus distinguishable, because our rules governing third-party challenges (rightly or wrongly) are more lenient in vagueness cases.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Zadvydas</em>, by contrast, was a straightforward as-applied constitutional challenge.  It concerned a constitutional doubt that arose from \xc2\xa71231(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s application to Zadvydas himself, not its hypothetical application to other aliens, as its careful distinction between admitted and inadmissible aliens shows.  To the extent that the rule of lenity is a nonconstitutionally based presumption about the interpretation of criminal statutes, the <em>Thompson/Center Arms </em>interpretive principle is fundamentally different from the canon of constitutional avoidance, because the rule of lenity is wholly independent of the rules governing constitutional adjudication.  Either way, this case does not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s restatement of modern avoidance principles.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases at bar illustrate well the exception to the normal operation of as-applied constitutional adjudication that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach creates.  Congress explicitly provided that unconstitutional applications of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) should be severed from constitutional applications.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Congress has thus indicated that courts should examine whether \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) raises a constitutional doubt application by application.  After all, under the severability clause, if <em>Zadvydas</em> had held unconstitutional the indefinite detention of Zadvydas and Ho Ma, the constitutionality of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s indefinite detention of Benitez and Martinez would remain an open question.  Although <em>Zadvydas</em> did not formally hold \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) to be unconstitutional as applied to the aliens before it, the same procedure should be followed when analyzing whether \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) raises a constitutional doubt.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court today limits applications of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) that may well be constitutional solely on the basis of constitutional doubts as to <em>other</em> applications, and despite that the severability clause contemplates application-by-application examination of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court misapprehends my interpretive approach.  It suggests that I would \xe2\x80\x9cspare [us] the necessity of ever finding a statute unconstitutional as applied,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ante</em>, at 13, and \xe2\x80\x9cwould render every statute a chameleon, its meaning subject to change depending on the presence or absence of constitutional concerns in each individual case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10.  My approach does none of this.  I simply would read ambiguous statutes to avoid as-applied constitutional doubts only if those doubts are present in the case before the Court.  This leaves plenty of room for as-applied invalidation of statutes that are unambiguously unconstitutional.  Nor would I permit a court to read every statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning to depend on constitutional concerns.  That is permissible, in my view, only if the statute is ambiguous.  Granted, I am thereby guilty of leaving courts free to interpret ambiguous statutes \xe2\x80\x9cas becoming inoperative when they \xe2\x80\x98approach constitutional limits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 13<em>.</em>  That is hardly an absurd result\xe2\x80\x94unless one considers the modern canon of constitutional avoidance itself to be absurd.  Every application of that canon, by rejecting a plausible interpretation of a statute, reads the statute to be inoperative to the extent it raises a constitutional doubt or \xe2\x80\x9climit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In truth, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive application of modern constitutional avoidance doctrine poses the greater danger.  A disturbing number of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have applied the canon of constitutional doubt to statutes that were on their face clear.  See, <em>e.g., INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 327\xe2\x80\x93336 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting);<em> Public Citizen</em> v. <em>Department of Justice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/440/index.html">491 U. S. 440</a>, 481\xe2\x80\x93482 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Lowe</em> v. <em>SEC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/181/index.html">472 U. S. 181</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1985) (White, J., concurring in result).  This Court and others may now employ the \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d approach to limit the application of statutes wholesale by searching for hypothetical unconstitutional applications of them\xe2\x80\x94or, worse yet, hypothetical constitutional <em>doubts</em>\xe2\x80\x94despite the absence of any facial constitutional problem (at least, so long as those hypothetical doubts pose \xe2\x80\x9ca multitude of constitutional problems,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9).  This is so even if Congress has expressed its clear intent that unconstitutional applications should be severed from constitutional applications, regardless of whether the challenger has third-party standing to raise the constitutional issue, and without the need to engage in full-fledged constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This danger is real.  In <em>St. Cyr</em>, this Court held that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) did not divest district courts of jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241 over habeas actions filed by criminal aliens to challenge removal orders, 533 U. S., at 314.  The Court did so because it thought that otherwise the statute would preclude any avenue of judicial review of removal orders of criminal aliens, thus raising a serious Suspension Clause question.  <em>Id.</em>, at 305.  This was a construction of (among other provisions) 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71252(a)(1) and 1252(b)(9), and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241, none of which distinguishes between criminal and noncriminal aliens.  533 U. S., at 308\xe2\x80\x93314.  The INA, however, clearly allows noncriminal aliens, unlike criminal aliens, a right to judicial review of removal decisions in the courts of appeals under the review provisions of \xc2\xa71252(a)(1), and <em>St. Cyr </em>involved only criminal aliens.  After <em>St. Cyr</em>, therefore, one would have thought that \xe2\x80\x9cnoncriminal aliens seeking to challenge their removal orders . . . [would] still presumably be required to proceed directly to the court of appeals by way of petition for review, under the restrictive modified Hobbs Act review provisions set forth in \xc2\xa71252(a)(1),\xe2\x80\x9d rather than sue directly under the habeas statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 335 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and Thomas, JJ., dissenting).  Yet lower courts, relying on a version of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clowest common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d principle, have held just the opposite: They have entertained noncriminal aliens\xe2\x80\x99 habeas actions challenging removal orders.  <em>Chmakov </em>v. <em>Blackman</em>, 266 F.\xc2\xa03d 210, 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (CA3 2001); see also <em>Riley </em>v. <em>INS</em>, 310 F.\xc2\xa03d 1253, 1256 (CA10 2002); <em>Liu </em>v. <em>INS</em>, 293 F.\xc2\xa03d 36, 38\xe2\x80\x9341 (CA2 2002).  The logic in allowing noncriminal aliens, who have a right to judicial review of removal decisions, to take advantage of constitutional doubt that arises from precluding any<em> </em>avenue of judicial review for criminal aliens, see <em>St. Cyr</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 305, escapes me.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is also mistaken in affording <em>Zadvydas</em> <em>stare decisis</em> effect.  <em>Zadvydas</em> was wrong in both its statutory and its constitutional analysis for the reasons expressed well by the dissents in that case.  See 533 U. S., at 705\xe2\x80\x93718 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 702\xe2\x80\x93705 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  I continue to adhere to those views and will not repeat the analysis of my colleagues.  I write only to explain why I do not consider <em>Zadvydas </em>to bind us.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Zadvydas </em>cast itself as a statutory case, but that fact should not prevent us from overruling it.  It is true that we give stronger <em>stare decisis</em> effect to our holdings in statutory cases than in constitutional cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>South Carolina Public Railways Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/197/index.html">502 U. S. 197</a>, 205 (1991).  This rule, however, is not absolute, and we should not hesitate to allow our precedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Congress when our statutory precedent is \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbadly reasoned.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Holder</em> v. <em>Hall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/874/index.html">512 U. S. 874</a>, 936 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U. S. 808</a>, 827 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have never applied <em>stare decisis</em> mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U. S. 658</a>, 695 (1978).  The mere fact that Congress can overturn our cases by statute is no excuse for failing to overrule a statutory precedent of ours that is clearly wrong, for the realities of the legislative process often preclude readopting the original meaning of a statute that we have upset.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) is untenable.  Section 1231(a)(6) provides that aliens whom the Secretary of Homeland Security has ordered removed \xe2\x80\x9cmay be detained beyond the removal period.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no qualification to this authorization, and no reference to a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d limitation.  Just as we exhaust the aid of the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional tools of statutory construction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843, n.\xc2\xa09 (1984), before deferring to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a statute, so too should we exhaust those tools before deciding that a statute is ambiguous and that an alternative plausible construction of the statute should be adopted. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of those traditional tools begins and ends with the text of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6).  <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 observation that \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress had meant to authorize long-term detention of unremovable aliens, it certainly could have spoken in clearer terms,\xe2\x80\x9d 533 U. S., at 697, proves nothing.  Congress could have spoken more clearly in any statutory case in which the statute does not mention the particular factual scenario before the Court.  Congress provided for a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d limit to detentions pending removal in other portions of \xc2\xa71231.  <em>Id.,</em> at 708 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Its failure to do the same in \xc2\xa71231(a)(6) confirms what is unmistakable from its terms: that there is no time limit on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s power to detain aliens.  There is no textually evident alternative construction that would avoid the constitutional doubts identified by the majority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even apart from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s incredible reading of \xc2\xa71231(a)(6), the normal reason for affording our statutory holdings strong <em>stare decisis</em> effect\xe2\x80\x94that Congress is free to overrule them if it disagrees\xe2\x80\x94does not apply to <em>Zadvydas</em>.  <em>Zadvydas</em> is a statutory case in name only.  Although the <em>Zadvydas</em> majority purported to find indefinite detention only constitutionally doubtful, its lengthy analysis strongly signaled to Congress that indefinite detention of admitted aliens would be unconstitutional.  Indeed, far from avoiding that constitutional question in <em>Zadvydas</em>, the Court took it head on, giving it extended treatment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 690\xe2\x80\x93697; but see <em>ante</em>, at 10 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamenta[l]\xe2\x80\x9d tenet that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he canon [of constitutional avoidance] is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Zadvydas</em> makes clear that the Court thought indefinite detention to be more than constitutionally suspect, and there is evidence that some Members of Congress understood as much.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This is why the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that if \xe2\x80\x9cthe security of our borders will be compromised if [the United States] must release into the country inadmissible aliens who cannot be removed. . . . Congress can attend to it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 14, rings hollow.  Short of constitutional amendment, it is only within the power of this Court to correct <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court points to 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71226a(a)(6) (2000 ed., Supp. II), a statute that Congress passed shortly after <em>Zadvydas</em>, as evidence that Congress can correct <em>Zadvydas</em>\xe2\x80\x99 mistake.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa08.  This statute only confirms my concern that <em>Zadvydas</em> is legislatively uncorrectable.  Section 1226a(a)(6) authorizes detention for a period of six months beyond the removal period of aliens who present a national security threat, but only to the extent that those aliens\xe2\x80\x99 removal is not reasonably foreseeable.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa08.  Yet <em>Zadvydas</em> conceded that indefinite detention might not violate due process in \xe2\x80\x9ccertain special and narrow nonpunitive circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6 where a special justification, such as harm-threatening mental illness, outweighs the individual\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U. S., at 690 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Moreover, <em>Zadvydas</em> set a 6-month presumptive outer limit on the detention power.  <em>Id.</em>, at 701.  Congress crafted \xc2\xa71226a(a)(6) to operate within the boundaries <em>Zadvydas</em> set.  This provision says nothing about whether Congress may authorize detention of aliens for greater lengths of time or for reasons the Court found constitutionally problematic in <em>Zadvydas</em>. </p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
