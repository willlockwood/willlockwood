These schemes allow in-state, but not out-of-state, wineries to make direct sales to consumers.  This differential treatment explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce by limiting the emerging and significant direct-sale business.  Influenced by an increasing number of small wineries and a decreasing number of wine wholesalers, direct sales have grown because small wineries may not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  In Nos. 03\xe2\x80\x931116 and 03\xe2\x80\x931120, Michigan residents, joined by an intervening out-of-state winery, sued Michigan officials, claiming that the State\xe2\x80\x99s laws violate the Commerce Clause.  The State and an intervening in-state wholesalers association responded that the direct-shipment ban was a valid exercise of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Twenty-first Amendment.  The District Court sustained the scheme, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, rejecting the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes state liquor laws from Commerce Clause strictures and holding that there was no showing that the State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means.  In No. 03\xe2\x80\x931274, out-of-state wineries and their New York customers filed suit against state officials, seeking, <em>inter alia,</em> a declaration that the State\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws violate the Commerce Clause.  State liquor wholesalers and retailers\xe2\x80\x99 representatives intervened in support of the State.  The District Court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that New York\xe2\x80\x99s laws fell within the ambit of its powers under the Twenty-first Amendment.  Here, respondents in the Michigan cases and petitioners in the New York case are referred to as the wineries, while the opposing parties are referred to as the States.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Both States\xe2\x80\x99 laws discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and that discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has long held that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate \xe2\x80\x9cdifferential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/index.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 99.  Laws such as those at issue contradict the principles underlying this rule by depriving citizens of their right to have access to other States\xe2\x80\x99 markets on equal terms.  The Michigan system\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory character is obvious.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement, but out-of-state wineries, even if licensed, must go through a wholesaler and retailer.  The resulting price differential, plus the possible inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s market.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s scheme also grants in-state wineries access to state consumers on preferential terms.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, but requires an out-of-state winery to open a New York branch office and warehouse, which drives up its costs.  Out-of-state wineries are also ineligible for a \xe2\x80\x9cfarm winery\xe2\x80\x9d license, which provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment does not allow States to regulate direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of in-state producers.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 position is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents and the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0This Court invalidated many state liquor regulations before the Eighteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification, finding either that the Commerce Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor, <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Donald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/58/index.html">165 U. S. 58</a>, or that States could not pass facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, <em>Bowman</em> v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/125/465/index.html">125 U. S. 465</a>.  While States could ban domestic liquor production, <em>Mugler</em> v. <em>Kansas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/index.html">123 U. S. 623</a>, such laws were ineffective because they could not regulate imported liquor in its original package, <em>Leisy</em> v. <em>Hardin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/135/100/index.html">135 U. S. 100</a>.  To resolve this matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act, which empowered the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor.  After this Court narrowly construed the Act to permit regulation of the resale of imported liquor, not its direct shipment to consumers, <em>Rhodes</em> v. <em>Iowa,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/170/412/index.html">170 U. S. 412</a>, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act to close the direct-shipment loophole, see <em>Clark Distilling Co.</em> v. <em>Western Maryland R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/242/311/index.html">242 U. S. 311</a>.<em> </em>The States argue that the Webb-Kenyon Act went further, removing any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations, but that reading conflicts with <em>Clark Distilling</em>\xe2\x80\x99s description of the Webb-Kenyon Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose<em>,</em> which was simply to extend the Wilson Act.  Nor does the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text compel a different response.  At the very least, it expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle disfavoring discrimination against out-of-state goods.  Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes state discrimination.  The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb-Kenyon Act did not displace, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against out-of-state liquor.  States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal terms.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0A brief respite from these legal battles brought on by the Eighteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification ended with the Twenty-first Amendment.  The States contend that \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment transfers to States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state goods, but the pre-Amendment history recited here provides strong support for the view that \xc2\xa72 only restored to the States the powers they had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.  The Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.  It did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they never enjoyed.  Cases decided soon after the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification did not take account of the underlying history and were inconsistent with this view, <em>e.g., State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.</em> v. <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/59/index.html">299 U. S. 59</a>, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to consider this history did not reflect a consensus that such evidence was irrelevant or that prior history was unsupportive of the principle that the Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state liquor.  More recent cases confirm that the Twenty-first Amendment does not supersede other provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace the rule that States may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0This Court has held, in the modern \xc2\xa72 cases, (1) that state laws violating other provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment, <em>e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Rhode Island,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/484/index.html">517 U. S. 484</a>, (2) that \xc2\xa72 does not abrogate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc.</em> v. <em>Crisp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/691/index.html">467 U. S. 691</a>, and (3) as most relevant here, that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination principle, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Dias,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/263/index.html">468 U. S. 263</a>, 276.  <em>Bacchus,</em> which dealt with a Hawaii excise tax exempting some in-state alcoholic beverages, provides a particularly telling example of this last proposition, and this Court declines the States\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion to overrule or limit that case.  The decision to invalidate the instant direct-shipment laws also does not call into question their three-tier systems\xe2\x80\x99 constitutionality, see <em>North Dakota</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/index.html">495 U. S. 423</a>, 432.  State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  In contrast, the instant cases involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Concluding that the States\xe2\x80\x99 direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry, for this Court must still consider whether either State\xe2\x80\x99s regime \xe2\x80\x9cadvances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New Energy Co. of Ind.</em> v. <em>Limbach,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/269/index.html">486 U. S. 269</a>, 278.  The States provide little evidence for their claim that purchasing wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  The 26 States now permitting direct shipments report no such problem, and the States can minimize any risk with less restrictive steps, such as requiring an adult signature on delivery.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 tax evasion justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipment, whether in or out of state, brings the potential for tax evasion.  However, this argument is a diversion with regard to Michigan, which does not rely on in-state wholesalers to collect taxes on out-of-state wines.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s tax collection objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce, <em>e.g., </em>by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping, which is what it does for in-state wineries.  Both States also benefit from federal laws that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  Other rationales\xe2\x80\x94facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability\xe2\x80\x94can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.

The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States\xe2\x80\x99 borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 5\xe2\x80\x937 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 5; 27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7205;<em> </em>see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Bainbridge</em> v. <em>Turner</em>, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 1104, 1106 (CA11 2002).  We have held previously that States can mandate a three-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority under the Twenty-first Amendment.  <em>North Dakota</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/index.html">495 U. S. 423</a>, 432 (1990); <em>id.</em>, at 447 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  As relevant to today\xe2\x80\x99s cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  <em>Id</em>., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/\npubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various restrictions.  Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment.  <em>Id</em>., at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  In many parts of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market.  According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate bans on interstate direct shipping represent the single largest regulatory barrier to expanded e-commerce in wine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the State\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesaler\xe2\x80\x99s markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the State\xe2\x80\x99s three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)\xe2\x80\x93(4).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for \xe2\x80\x9cwine maker\xe2\x80\x9d licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  \xc2\xa7436.1113(9) (West 2001); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7436.1537(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 \xe2\x80\x9coutside seller of wine\xe2\x80\x9d license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.

It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.

This rule is essential to the foundations of the Union.  The mere fact of nonresidence should not foreclose a producer in one State from access to markets in other States.  <em>H.\xc2\xa0P.

States may not enact laws that burden out-of-state producers or shippers simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses.  This mandate \xe2\x80\x9creflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hughes</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/index.html">441 U.

States do not need, and may not attempt, to negotiate with other States regarding their mutual economic interests.  Cf. U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Rivalries among the States are thus kept to a minimum, and a proliferation of trade zones is prevented.  See <em>C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.</em> v. <em>Clarkstown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/383/index.html">511 U. S. 383</a>, 390 (1994) (citing The Federalist No. 22, pp. 143\xe2\x80\x93145 (C.

Hunt ed. 1901)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the State\xe2\x80\x99s previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the State\xe2\x80\x99s many wineries.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The current patchwork of laws\xe2\x80\x94with some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocity\xe2\x80\x94is essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine \xe2\x80\x9cinvite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dean Milk Co.</em> v. <em>Madison,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/349/index.html">340 U.

Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N.\xc2\xa0Y. ABC Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory gauntlet.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s argument, in any event, is unconvincing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New York\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa776\xe2\x80\x93a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and \xc2\xa777(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x931274, pp. 159\xe2\x80\x93160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipping privilege.  We have \xe2\x80\x9cviewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pike</em> v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/index.html">397 U. S. 137</a>, 145 (1970).  New York\xe2\x80\x99s in-state presence requirement runs contrary to our admonition that States cannot require an out-of-state firm \xe2\x80\x9cto become a resident in order to compete on equal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.</em> v. <em>Reily,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/64/index.html">373 U.

See also <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 12 Wall. 418 (1871).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a \xe2\x80\x9cfarm winery\xe2\x80\x9d license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N.\xc2\xa0Y. ABC Law \xc2\xa776\xe2\x80\x93a(5) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state\xe2\x80\x9d).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, \xc2\xa777(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  \xc2\xa776(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have no difficulty concluding that New York, like Michigan, discriminates against interstate commerce through its direct-shipping laws.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face \xe2\x80\x9ca virtually <em>per se</em> rule of invalidity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>New Jersey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/index.html">437 U.

The two States, however, contend their statutes are saved by \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment, which provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe States\xe2\x80\x99 position is inconsistent with our precedents and with the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s history.

The movement made progress, and many States passed laws restricting or prohibiting the sale of alcohol.  This Court upheld state laws banning the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, <em>Mugler</em> v. <em>Kansas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/index.html">123 U. S. 623</a> (1887), but was less solicitous of laws aimed at imports.  In a series of cases before ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the Court, relying on the Commerce Clause, invalidated a number of state liquor regulations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases advanced two distinct principles.  First, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor.  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Donald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/58/index.html"></a><a href="/us/165/58/index.html">165 U.

In <em>Walling</em>, for example, the Court invalidated a Michigan tax that discriminated against liquor imports by exempting sales of local products.  The Court held that States were not free to pass laws burdening only out-of-state products:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA discriminating tax imposed by a State operating to the disadvantage of the products of other States when introduced into the first mentioned State, is, in effect, a regulation in restraint of commerce among the States, and as such is a usurpation of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Congress of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d 116 U. S., at 455.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from passing facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  <em>Rhodes</em> v. <em>Iowa,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/170/412/index.html">170 U.

Under this doctrine goods shipped in interstate commerce were immune from state regulation while in their original package.  As the Court explained in <em>Vance</em>,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original package they have been commingled with the general mass of property in the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  170 U. S., at 444\xe2\x80\x93445.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bowman </em>reserved the question whether a State could ban the sale of imported liquor altogether.  125 U. S.,<em> </em>at 499\xe2\x80\x93500.  Iowa responded to <em>Bowman</em> by doing just that but was thwarted once again.  In <em>Leisy, supra, </em>the Court held that Iowa could not ban the sale of imported liquor in its original package.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Leisy </em>left the States in a bind.  They could ban the production of domestic liquor, <em>Mugler</em>,<em> supra</em>, but these laws were ineffective because out-of-state liquor was immune from any state regulation as long as it remained in its original package, <em>Leisy</em>, <em>supra</em>.  To resolve the matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act (so named for Senator Wilson of Iowa), which empowered the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThat all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ch. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (codified at 27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7121).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBy its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only \xe2\x80\x9cto the same extent and in the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as domestic liquor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court confirmed this interpretation in <em>Scott, supra.</em> <em>Scott </em>involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s dispensary law, 1895 S.\xc2\xa0C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, \xc2\xa715 required the commissioner to \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  1895 S.\xc2\xa0C. Acts p. 732.  Second, \xc2\xa723 of the statute limited the State\xe2\x80\x99s markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided \xe2\x80\x9cno such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.\xe2\x80\x9d  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  <em>Id., </em>at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was \xe2\x80\x9cnot intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated \xe2\x80\x9cequality or uniformity of treatment under state laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> and did not allow South Carolina to provide \xe2\x80\x9can unjust preference\xe2\x80\x9d to its products \xe2\x80\x9cas against similar products of the other States,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id., </em>at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa715 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.  <em>Id., </em>at 104\xe2\x80\x93106 (opinion of Brown, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Wilson Act increased the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to police liquor imports, it did not solve all their problems.  In <em>Vance </em>and <em>Rhodes\xe2\x80\x94</em>two cases decided soon after <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x94the Court made clear that the Wilson Act did not authorize States to prohibit direct shipments for personal use.  In <em>Vance</em>, the Court characterized <em>Scott </em>as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South Carolina dispensary law \xe2\x80\x9camount[ed] to an unjust discrimination against liquors, the products of other States.\xe2\x80\x9d  170 U. S.<em>, </em>at 442.  This aspect of the <em>Scott </em>holding, which confirmed the Wilson Act\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination principle, was based \xe2\x80\x9con particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.\xe2\x80\x9d  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cin so far as the law then in question forbade the sending \xe2\x80\xa6 of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

S., at 443 (distinguishing between the provisions at issue in <em>Scott </em>\xe2\x80\x9cwhich were held to operate a discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d and those which barred direct shipment for personal use).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This second holding, that consumers had the right to receive alcoholic beverages shipped in interstate commerce for personal use, was only implicit in <em>Scott</em>.  165 U. S.,<em> </em>at 78, 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  The Court expanded on this point, however, not only in <em>Vance</em> but again in <em>Rhodes.</em> <em>Rhodes </em>construed the Wilson Act narrowly to avoid interference with this right.  The Act, the Court said, authorized States to regulate only the resale of imported liquor, not direct shipment to consumers for personal use.  170 U. S., at 421.  Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the <em>Rhodes </em>Court read the words \xe2\x80\x9cupon arrival\xe2\x80\x9d in the Wilson Act as authorizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of the State to attach to an interstate commerce shipment,\xe2\x80\x9d only after its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 426.  See also <em>id., </em>at 424; <em>Bridenbaugh</em> v. <em>Freeman-Wilson</em>, 227 F.\xc2\xa03d 848, 852 (CA7 2000).  The Court interpreted the Wilson Act to overturn <em>Leisy</em> but leave <em>Bowman </em>intact.  <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>at 423\xe2\x80\x93424.  The right to regulate did not attach until the liquor was in the hands of the customer.  As a result, the mail-order liquor trade continued to thrive.  Rogers, Interstate Commerce in Intoxicating Liquors Before the Webb-Kenyon Act, 4 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 353, 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (1917).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After considering a series of bills in response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 37 Stat. 699, 27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7122.  See Rogers, <em>supra</em>, at 363\xe2\x80\x93370.  The Act, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases,\xe2\x80\x9d provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThat the shipment or transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State \xe2\x80\xa6 into any other State \xe2\x80\xa6 which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State \xe2\x80\xa6 is hereby prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 Stat.<em>,</em> at 699\xe2\x80\x93700.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  <em>Vance </em>and <em>Rhodes </em>implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 3\xe2\x80\x936 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).  Congress overrode the veto and in <em>Clark Distilling Co.</em> v. <em>Western Maryland R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/242/311/index.html">242 U. S. 311</a> (1917), a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  <em>Id., </em>at 321\xe2\x80\x93322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in <em>Clark Distilling </em>\xe2\x80\x9cforbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act \xe2\x80\x9cwas enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 324.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose \xe2\x80\x9cwas to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage, <em>i.e.</em> its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under <em>Bowman</em> and <em>Rhodes</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in <em>Clark Distilling</em>.  <em>Clark Distilling </em>recognized that the Webb-Kenyon Act extended the Wilson Act to allow the States to intercept liquor shipments before those shipments reached the consignee.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Webb-Kenyon Act also reversed the Wilson Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on discriminatory treatment of out-of-state liquors cannot be reconciled with <em>Clark Distilling\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>description of the Webb-Kenyon Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csimply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  242 U. S., at 324.  See also <em>McCormick &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/131/index.html">286 U. S. 131</a>, 140\xe2\x80\x93141 (1932).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cshipment or transportation\xe2\x80\x9d only where it runs afoul of the State\xe2\x80\x99s generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 141 (noting that the Act authorized enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9cvalid\xe2\x80\x9d state laws).  At the very least, the Webb-Kenyon Act expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle, unexceptional at the time the Act was passed and still applicable today, <em>Hillside Dairy Inc.</em> v. <em>Lyons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/59/index.html">539 U. S. 59</a>, 66 (2003), that discrimination against out-of-state goods is disfavored.  Cf. <em>Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/648/index.html">451 U. S. 648</a>, 652\xe2\x80\x93653 (1981) (holding that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71011 <em>et seq.</em>, removed all dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny of state insurance laws; 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71011 provides: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.  If Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim in passing the Webb-Kenyon Act was to authorize States to discriminate against out-of-state goods then its first step would have been to repeal the Wilson Act.  It did not do so.  There is no inconsistency between the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act sufficient to warrant an inference that the latter repealed the former.  See <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Miller,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/235/422/index.html">235 U. S. 422</a>, 428 (1914) (noting that implied repeals are disfavored).  Indeed, this Court has twice noted that the Wilson Act remains in effect today. <em>Hostetter </em>v.<em> Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/324/index.html">377 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb-Kenyon Act did not displace, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s line of Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against liquor produced out of state.  The rule of <em>Tiernan</em>, <em>Walling</em>, and <em>Scott </em>remained in effect: States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal terms.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he intent of \xe2\x80\xa6 the Webb-Kenyon Act \xe2\x80\xa6 was to take from intoxicating liquor the protection of the interstate commerce laws in so far as necessary to deny them an advantage over the intoxicating liquors produced in the state into which they were brought, yet, [the Act does not] show an intent or purpose to so abdicate control over interstate commerce as to permit discrimination against the intoxicating liquor brought into one state from another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pacific Fruit &amp; Produce Co.</em> v. <em>Martin, </em>16 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 34, 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (WD Wash. 1936).

With the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment 14 years later, however, nationwide Prohibition came to an end.  Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment.  Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment is at issue here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan and New York say the provision grants to the States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state goods.  The history we have recited does not support this position.  To the contrary, it provides strong support for the view that \xc2\xa72 restored to the States the powers they had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe wording of \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment closely follows the Webb-Kenyon and Wilson Acts, expressing the framers\xe2\x80\x99 clear intention of constitutionalizing the Commerce Clause framework established under those statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Craig</em> v. <em>Boren,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/index.html">429 U.

The Amendment did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they had not enjoyed at any earlier time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of the cases decided soon after ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment did not take account of this history and were inconsistent with this view.  In <em>State Bd. of Equalization of Cal. </em>v<em>.</em> <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/299/59/index.html">299 U.

They request us to construe the Amendment as saying, in effect: The State may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its borders; but if it permits such manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms.  To say that, would involve not a construction of the Amendment, but a rewriting of it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court reaffirmed the States\xe2\x80\x99 broad powers under \xc2\xa72 in a series of cases, see <em>Mahoney </em>v.<em> Joseph Triner Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/401/index.html">304 U.

The Court has applied this rule in the context of the First Amendment, <em>44 Liquormart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Rhode Island,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/484/index.html">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996); the Establishment Clause, <em>Larkin</em> v. <em>Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s Den, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/116/index.html">459 U.

S. 341</a> (1964).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court has held that \xc2\xa72 does not abrogate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor.  <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc.</em> v. <em>Crisp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/691/index.html">467 U.

The argument that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Twenty-first Amendment has somehow operated to \xe2\x80\x98repeal\xe2\x80\x99 the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x9d for alcoholic beverages has been rejected.  <em>Hostetter,</em> 377 U. S., at 331\xe2\x80\x93332.  Though the Court\xe2\x80\x99s language in <em>Hostetter </em>may have come uncommonly close to hyperbole in describing this argument as \xe2\x80\x9can absurd oversimplification,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpatently bizarre,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrably incorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the basic point was sound.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, and most relevant to the issue at hand, the Court has held that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause.  <em>Bacchus,</em> 468 U. S., at 276; <em>Brown&amp;nbhyph;Forman Distillers Corp.</em> v. <em>New York State Liquor Authority,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/573/index.html">476 U. S. 573</a> (1986); <em>Healy</em> v. <em>Beer Institute,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/324/index.html">491 U. S. 324</a> (1989).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown-Forman, supra</em>, at 579.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bacchus</em> provides a particularly telling example of this proposition.  At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that State.  The Court rejected the argument that Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment.  468 U. S.,<em> </em>at 274\xe2\x80\x93276.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 276.  Despite attempts to distinguish it in the instant cases, <em>Bacchus</em> forecloses any contention that \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatory direct-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  See also <em>Brown-Forman, supra</em>, at 576 (invalidating a New York price affirmation statute that required producers to limit the price of liquor based on the lowest price they offered out of state); <em>Healy</em>, 491 U. S., at 328 (invalidating a similar Connecticut statute); <em>id.</em>, at 344 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Connecticut statute\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity is fully established by its facial discrimination against interstate commerce\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. This is so despite the fact that the law regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages, since its discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that <em>Bacchus </em>is fatal to their position, the States suggest it should be overruled or limited to its facts.  As the foregoing analysis makes clear, we decline their invitation.  Furthermore, <em>Bacchus </em>does not stand alone in recognizing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not give the States complete freedom to regulate where other constitutional principles are at stake.  A retreat from <em>Bacchus </em>would also undermine <em>Brown-Forman </em>and <em>Healy</em>.  These cases invalidated state liquor regulations under the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, <em>Healy </em>explicitly relied on the discriminatory character of the Connecticut price affirmation statute.  491 U. S.<em>, </em>at 340\xe2\x80\x93341.  <em>Brown-Forman </em>and <em>Healy </em>lend significant support to the conclusion that the Twenty-first Amendment does not immunize all<em> </em>laws from Commerce Clause challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.  This does not follow from our holding.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Midcal, supra</em>, at 110.  A State which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective.  States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system.  We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is \xe2\x80\x9cunquestionably legitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>North Dakota</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 495 U. S., at 432.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 447 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Twenty-first Amendment \xe2\x80\xa6 empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler\xe2\x80\x9d).  State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime \xe2\x80\x9cadvances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New Energy Co. of Ind.</em>, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The States, aided by several <em>amici,</em> claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors\xe2\x80\x99 increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  <em>Id.,</em> at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98want instant gratification.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 33, and n.\xc2\xa0137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States\xe2\x80\x99 unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the \xe2\x80\x9cclearest showing\xe2\x80\x9d to justify discriminatory state regulation, <em>C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,</em> 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even were we to credit the States\xe2\x80\x99 largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The States\xe2\x80\x99 tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cEach outside seller of wine shall submit \xe2\x80\xa6 a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month\xe2\x80\x9d).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the State\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, <em>e.g</em>., N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 38\xe2\x80\x9340.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, <em>e.g</em>., S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa761\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93747(C) (West Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winery\xe2\x80\x99s federal\nlicense if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 96\xe2\x80\x933 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7204.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  \xc2\xa7122a(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The \xe2\x80\x9cburden is on the State to show that \xe2\x80\x98the <em>discrimination</em> is demonstrably justified,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hunt,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/334/index.html">504 U. S. 334</a>, 344 (1992) (emphasis in original).  The Court has upheld state regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce only after finding, based on concrete record evidence, that a State\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscriminatory alternatives will prove unworkable.  See, <em>e.g., Maine</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/index.html">477 U. S. 131</a>, 141\xe2\x80\x93144 (1986).  Michigan and New York have not satisfied this exacting standard.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States have broad power to regulate liquor under \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961761">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nGRANHOLM V.

Absent such congressional approval, a state law may violate the unwritten rules described as the \xe2\x80\x9cdormant Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x9d either by imposing an undue burden on both out-of-state and local producers engaged in interstate activities or by treating out-of-state producers less favorably than their local competitors.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pike</em> v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/index.html">397 U.

S. 617</a> (1978).\nA state law totally prohibiting the sale of an ordinary article of commerce might impose an even more serious burden on interstate commerce.  If Congress may nevertheless authorize the States to enact such laws, surely the people may do so through the process of amending our Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The New York and Michigan laws challenged in these cases would be patently invalid under well settled dormant Commerce Clause principles if they regulated sales of an ordinary article of commerce rather than wine.  But ever since the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Twenty-first Amendment, our Constitution has placed commerce in alcoholic beverages in a special category.  Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment expressly provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today many Americans, particularly those members of the younger generations who make policy decisions, regard alcohol as an ordinary article of commerce, subject to substantially the same market and legal controls as other consumer products.  That was definitely not the view of the generations that made policy in 1919 when the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified or in 1933 when it was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On the contrary, the moral condemnation of the use of alcohol as a beverage represented not merely the convictions of our religious leaders, but the views of a sufficiently large majority of the population to warrant the rare exercise of the power to amend the Constitution on two occasions.  The Eighteenth Amendment entirely prohibited commerce in \xe2\x80\x9cintoxicating liquors\xe2\x80\x9d for beverage purposes throughout the United States and the territories subject to its jurisdiction.  While \xc2\xa71 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the nationwide prohibition, \xc2\xa72 gave the States the option to maintain equally comprehensive prohibitions in their respective jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The views of judges who lived through the debates that led to the ratification of those Amendments are entitled to special deference.  Foremost among them was Justice Brandeis, whose understanding of a State\xe2\x80\x99s right to discriminate in its regulation of out-of-state alcohol could not have been clearer:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe plaintiffs ask us to limit [\xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s] broad command.  They request us to construe the Amendment as saying, in effect: The State may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its borders; but if it permits such manufacture and sale, it must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms.  To say that, would involve not a construction of the Amendment, but a rewriting of it\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Can it be doubted that a State might establish a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of beer, and either prohibit all competing importations, or discourage importation by laying a heavy impost, or channelize desired importations by confining them to a single consignee?\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.</em> v. <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/59/index.html">299 U.

The notion that discriminatory state laws violated the unwritten prohibition against balkanizing the American economy\xe2\x80\x94while persuasive in contemporary times when alcohol is viewed as an ordinary article of commerce\xe2\x80\x94would have seemed strange indeed to the millions of Americans who condemned the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cdemon rum\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s and 1930\xe2\x80\x99s.  Indeed, they expressly authorized the \xe2\x80\x9cbalkanization\xe2\x80\x9d that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision condemns.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision may represent sound economic policy and may be consistent with the policy choices of the contemporaries of Adam Smith who drafted our original Constitution;[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] it is not, however, consistent with the policy choices made by those who amended our Constitution in 1919 and 1933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My understanding (and recollection) of the historical context reinforces my conviction that the text of \xc2\xa72 should be \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly and colloquially interpreted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carter</em> v. <em>Virginia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/131/index.html">321 U.

S. 200</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1993) (applying presumption that reenacted statute incorporates settled judicial construction).  <em>McCormick </em>considered a state law that prohibited out-of-state manufacturers (as well as in-state manufacturers) from shipping liquor to a licensed in-state dealer without first obtaining a wholesaler permit.  The Court held that by shipping liquor into the State without a license, the out-of-state manufacturer \xe2\x80\x9c[fell] directly within the terms of\xe2\x80\x9d the Webb-Kenyon Act, thus violating it.  286 U. S., at 143; see also <em>Rainier Brewing Co.</em> v. <em>Great Northern Pacific S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/259/150/index.html">259 U. S. 150</a>, 152\xe2\x80\x93153 (1922) (holding that under the Webb-Kenyon Act, beer importers must \xe2\x80\x9ccarry\xe2\x80\x9d beer into the State \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner allowed by the laws of that State\xe2\x80\x9d).  While the law at issue in <em>McCormick </em>did not discriminate against out-of-state products, the construction of the Webb-Kenyon Act it adopted applies equally to state laws that so discriminate.  If an out-of-state manufacturer shipping liquor to an in-state distributor without a license \xe2\x80\x9cs[ells]\xe2\x80\x9d liquor \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of any law of such State\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Webb-Kenyon, as <em>McCormick</em> held, an out-of-state winery directly shipping wine to consumers in violation of even a discriminatory state law does so as well.  The Michigan and New York laws are indistinguishable in relevant part from the state law upheld in <em>McCormick</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court answers that the Webb-Kenyon Act\xe2\x80\x99s text \xe2\x80\x9creadily can be construed as forbidding \xe2\x80\x98shipment or transportation\xe2\x80\x99 only where it runs afoul of the States\xe2\x80\x99 generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  What the Court means by \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally applicable\xe2\x80\x9d laws is unclear, for the Court concedes that the Webb-Kenyon Act allows States to pass laws discriminating against out-of-state wholesalers.  See <em>ante</em>, at 21, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  By \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally applicable [state] laws,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, the Court apparently means all state laws except for those that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate\xe2\x80\x9d against out-of-state liquor products.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court leaves unexplained how this ad\xc2\xa0hoc exception follows from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s language leaves no room for this exception.  The Act does not condition a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to regulate the receipt, possession, and use of liquor free from negative Commerce Clause immunity on the character of the state law.  It does not mention \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d much less discrimination against out-of-state liquor products.  Instead, it prohibits the interstate shipment of liquor into a State \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of any law of such State.\xe2\x80\x9d  27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7122.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny law of such State\xe2\x80\x9d means any law, including a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between discrimination against manufacturers and discrimination against wholesalers is equally unjustified.  There is no warrant in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text for treating regulated entities differently depending on their place in the distribution chain: The Act applies in undifferentiated fashion to \xe2\x80\x9cany person interested therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  A wine manufacturer shipping wine directly to a consumer is an interested party, just as an out-of-state liquor wholesaler is.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contrast between the language of the Webb-Kenyon Act and its predecessor, the Wilson Act, casts still more doubt on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  The Wilson Act provided that liquor shipped into a State was \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State \xe2\x80\xa6 to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7121.  Even if this language does not authorize States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor products, see <em>ante</em>, at 15, the Webb-Kenyon Act has no comparable language addressing discrimination.  The contrast is telling.  It shows that the Webb-Kenyon Act encompasses laws that discriminate against both out-of-state wholesalers and out-of-state manufacturers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its conclusion that the Webb-Kenyon Act did not authorize States to discriminate, the Court relies heavily on <em>Clark Distilling Co.</em> v. <em>Western Maryland R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/242/311/index.html"></a><a href="/us/242/311/index.html">242 U. S. 311</a> (1917).  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Its reliance is misplaced.  <em>Clark Distilling </em>held that the Webb-Kenyon Act authorized a nondiscriminatory state law, 242 U. S., at 321\xe2\x80\x93322, and so had no direct occasion to pass on whether the Act also authorized discriminatory laws.  Nothing in it implicitly decided that unsettled question in the manner the Court suggests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that it is relevant, <em>Clark Distilling</em> supports the view that the Webb-Kenyon Act authorized States to discriminate.  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>Clark Distilling</em> did not say (on pages 321, 322 or elsewhere) that the Webb-Kenyon Act \xe2\x80\x9cempowered [States] to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that [they] treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Instead, <em>Clark Distilling </em>construed the Webb-Kenyon Act to \xe2\x80\x9cextend that which was done by the Wilson Act\xe2\x80\x9d in that its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  242 U. S., at 324.  The Court takes this passage only to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d state laws, <em>ante</em>, at 18, but this is not correct.  The passage the Court cites implies that the Webb-Kenyon Act also abrogated the nondiscrimination principle of the negative Commerce Clause, since that principle flows from the \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity characteristic of interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d no less than any other negative Commerce Clause doctrine.  In other words, <em>Clark Distilling </em>recognized that the Webb-Kenyon Act took \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection of interstate commerce away from <em>all</em> <em>receipt and possession of liquor prohibited by state law</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  242 U. S., at 325 (emphasis added).  <em>Clark Distilling </em>thus confirms what the text of the Webb-Kenyon Act makes clear: The Webb-Kenyon Act \xe2\x80\x9cextended\xe2\x80\x9d the Wilson Act by completely immunizing all state laws regulating liquor imports from negative Commerce Clause restraints.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Straying from the Webb-Kenyon Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, the Court speculates that Congress intended the Act merely to overrule a discrete line of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause cases invalidating \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d state liquor regulation laws, including <em>Vance</em> v. <em>W. A. Vandercook Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/170/438/index.html"></a><a href="/us/170/438/index.html"></a><a href="/us/170/438/index.html">170 U.

According to the majority, <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, the Webb-Kenyon Act left untouched this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases preventing States from regulating liquor in \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d fashion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Donald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/58/index.html"></a><a href="/us/165/58/index.html">165 U. S. 58</a> (1897) <em>(Scott);</em> <em>Walling</em> v. <em>Michigan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html">116 U.

The plain language of the Webb-Kenyon Act makes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s guesswork about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent unnecessary.  But even taken on its own terms, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s historical argument is unpersuasive.  History reveals that the Webb-Kenyon Act overturned not only <em>Vance </em>and <em>Rhodes</em>, but also <em>Scott</em> and therefore its \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d principle.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The origins of the Webb-Kenyon Act are in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Leisy</em> v. <em>Hardin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/135/100/index.html">135 U. S. 100</a> (1890).  <em>Leisy </em>held that States were prohibited from regulating the resale of alcohol imported from outside the State so long as the liquor stayed in its \xe2\x80\x9coriginal packag[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  This rule made it more difficult for States to prohibit the in-state consumption of liquor.  Even if a State banned the domestic production of liquor altogether, <em>Leisy </em>left it powerless to stop the flow of liquor from outside its borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress reacted swiftly by enacting the Wilson Act in August of 1890.  The Wilson Act authorized States to regulate liquor \xe2\x80\x9cupon arrival in such State\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9cin original packages or otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d 27 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7121, and therefore subjected imports to state jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cupon arrival within the jurisdiction of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rhodes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 433 (Gray, J., dissenting).  The Wilson Act accordingly abrogated <em>Leisy</em> and similar decisions by subjecting liquor imports to the operation of state law once the liquor came within a State\xe2\x80\x99s geographic borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than holding that the Wilson Act meant what it said, three decisions of this Court construed the Act to be a virtual nullity.  The first was <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra</em>.  South Carolina had decided to regulate traffic in liquor by monopolizing the sale and distribution of liquor.  All liquor, whether produced in or out of the State, could be sold to consumers in the State only by the state commissioner of alcohol.  <em>Id.,</em> at 66\xe2\x80\x9368, n.\xc2\xa01, 92.  The law thus prohibited out-of-state manufacturers and wholesalers, as well as their in-state counterparts, from shipping liquor directly to consumers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The appellee, Donald, was a citizen of South Carolina who had ordered liquor directly from out-of-state shippers for his own personal use, rather than through the state monopoly system as South Carolina law required.  <em>Id.</em>, at 59; see also <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Donald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/107/index.html">165 U. S. 107</a>, 108\xe2\x80\x93109 (1897) <em>(Donald).</em>  South Carolina officials seized the liquor he ordered after it had crossed South Carolina lines, but before he had received it.  Donald sued the officials for damages, as well as an injunction allowing him to import liquor directly from out-of-state shippers for his own personal use.  <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 69\xe2\x80\x9370; <em>Donald, supra,</em> at 109\xe2\x80\x93110.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held that South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ban on the direct shipment of liquor unconstitutionally interfered with the right of out-of-state entities to ship liquor directly to consumers for their personal use, entitling Donald to damages and injunctive relief.  <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 78, 99\xe2\x80\x93100; <em>Donald, supra,</em> at 114; see also <em>Vance</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 452 (describing the \xe2\x80\x9cruling\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Scott </em>to be that a State could not \xe2\x80\x9cforbid the shipment into the State from other States of intoxicating liquors for the use of a resident\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court reasoned that the ban on importation, \xe2\x80\x9cin effect, discriminate[d] between interstate and domestic commerce in commodities to make and use which are admitted to be lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em>, 165 U. S., at 100.  The Court reserved the question whether a state monopoly system that allowed consumers to import liquor directly was constitutional; for the Court, it \xe2\x80\x9csuffic[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ban on imports \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d] against the bringing of such articles in, and importing them from other States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 101.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s excuse for holding that the Wilson Act did not save the State\xe2\x80\x99s ban on importation was the same as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s excuse today: that the Wilson Act did not authorize \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d state legislation.  <em>Ibid</em>.  On this basis, the Court affirmed Donald\xe2\x80\x99s damages award.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to <em>Scott</em>, Senator Tillman of South Carolina quickly introduced the first version of what became the Webb-Kenyon Act.  His bill explicitly attempted to reverse the <em>Scott</em> decision.  The Senate Report on the bill noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he effect of [<em>Scott</em> was] to throw down all the barriers erected by the State law, in which she is protected by the Wilson bill, and allow the untrammeled importation of liquor into the State upon the simple claim that it is for private use.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 151, 55th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1897).  The Report also addressed <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ban on importation was \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d and adopted the <em>Scott</em> dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s view that the ban on importation effected \xe2\x80\x9cno discrimination against citizens of other States.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 151, at 5.<em> </em>The bill accordingly would have amended the Wilson Act to grant States \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute control of \xe2\x80\xa6 liquors or liquids within their borders, by whomsoever produced and for whatever use imported.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cong. Rec. 2612 (1897).  The bill passed in the Senate without debate.  It failed in the House, perhaps because the House Judiciary Committee added an amendment that barred discrimination against the products of other States, leaving <em>Scott </em>intact.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 667, 55th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1898).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, the Court continued to narrow the reach of the Wilson Act.  In <em>Rhodes</em> and<em> Vance</em>, the Court even more broadly stripped States of their control over liquor regulation.  <em>Rhodes </em>did so by holding that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cupon arrival in such State\xe2\x80\x9d in the Wilson Act meant that state law could regulate imports only after their delivery to a consignee within the State.  170 U. S., at 421 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This meant that States could regulate imported liquor, even when in its original package, but only after it had been delivered to the eventual consignee.  <em>Rhodes</em>, in other words, read the Wilson Act to overturn <em>Leisy, </em>but not  <em>Bowman</em> v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/125/465/index.html">125 U. S. 465</a> (1888), which had recognized a constitutional right to import liquor in its original package free from state regulation until it reached its consignee.  <em>Rhodes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 423.  Like <em>Leisy</em>, then, <em>Rhodes</em> seriously hampered the ability of States to intercept liquor at their borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Vance </em>involved the constitutionality of a law very similar to the law struck down in <em>Scott</em>.  After its loss in <em>Scott</em>, South Carolina amended its ban on importation.  Rather than flatly banning imports unless they went through the state monopoly system, the new law allowed out-of-state wholesalers and manufacturers to ship liquor directly to consumers, but only if the consumer showed that the liquor passed a state-administered test of its purity.  <em>Vance</em>, 170 U. S., at 454\xe2\x80\x93455.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Vance </em>had two distinct holdings.  First, the Court struck down this condition on the direct importation of liquor as an impermissible burden on \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right of the non-resident to ship into the State and of the resident in the State to receive for his own use.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 455.  The Court derived the right to direct importation primarily from the \xe2\x80\x9cruling\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Scott </em>that a State could not \xe2\x80\x9cforbid the shipment into the State from other States of intoxicating liquors for the use of a resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  170 U. S., at 452.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court held that, apart from its ban on direct shipments of liquor to consumers, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly over liquor distribution was otherwise constitutional.  <em>Id.</em>, at 450\xe2\x80\x93452.  It rejected the argument that this monopoly system was unconstitutionally discriminatory.  In particular, the Court reasoned that the monopoly system was not discriminatory because <em>Scott </em>had held (a holding that <em>Rhodes</em> had fortified) that South Carolina consumers had a constitutional right to import liquor for their own personal use, even if a State otherwise monopolized the sale and distribution of liquor.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A monopoly system, the Court implied, was nondiscriminatory under the rule of <em>Scott </em>only if it also allowed consumers to import liquor from out-of-state shippers for their own personal use.  Three Justices in <em>Vance </em>dissented from that holding, on the ground that such a state monopoly system constituted unconstitutional discrimination under, among other cases, <em>Scott</em> and <em>Walling</em> v. <em>Michigan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html">116 U. S. 446</a> (1886).  170 U. S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93468 (opinion of Shiras, J., joined by Fuller, C.\xc2\xa0J., and McKenna, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rhodes </em>and <em>Vance </em>swept more broadly than <em>Scott</em>.  <em>Rhodes</em> held that States lacked power to regulate imported liquor before it reached the consignee, regardless of whether the liquor was intended for the consignee\xe2\x80\x99s personal use, see <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 10; it did not, as the Court implies, simply repeat <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that consumers had a right to import liquor for their own personal use.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  <em>Rhodes</em>\xe2\x80\x99 holding, for example, made it easier for bootleggers to circumvent state prohibitions on the resale of imported liquor, because it enabled them to order large quantities of liquor directly from out-of-state interests.  For its part, <em>Vance</em> held that the right to import for personal use recognized in <em>Scott </em>applied even if the State conditioned the right to import directly on compliance with regulatory conditions (<em>e.g.,</em> a state-administered purity test).  Those broader holdings, consequently, spurred more vigorous congressional attempts to return control of liquor regulation to the States.  See R. Hamm, Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment 206\xe2\x80\x93212 (1995) (hereinafter Hamm); Rogers, Interstate Commerce in Intoxicating Liquors Before the Webb-Kenyon Act, 4 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 353, 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (1917).  The legislative debate in subsequent years accordingly focused on their effect.  That may be what misleads the majority into believing that the Webb-Kenyon Act took aim only at <em>Rhodes</em> and <em>Vance</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet early versions of the Webb-Kenyon Act, not to mention the Act itself, also overturned <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that banning the direct shipment of liquor for personal use was unconstitutionally discriminatory.  Like Senator Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s initial bill, other early versions of the Webb-Kenyon Act took aim at <em>Scott</em>, <em>Rhodes</em>, and <em>Vance</em>.  They made clear that out-of-state liquor was subject to state law immediately upon entering the State\xe2\x80\x99s territorial boundaries, even if intended for personal use.  See Hamm 206, 208.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The version that eventually became the Webb-Kenyon Act was likewise designed to overturn the holdings of all three cases, and thus to reverse <em>Scott\xe2\x80\x99</em>s \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d principle.  The House Report says that the bill was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to withdraw the protecting hand of interstate commerce from intoxicating liquors transported into a State or Territory and intended to be used therein in violation of the law of such State or Territory.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1461, 62d Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1913).  Thus, the bill targeted <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s notion (as applied by <em>Vance</em>) that imports destined for personal use were exempt from state regulation.  There was no mention of an exception for \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d state laws, though such an amendment to an earlier version of the Webb-Kenyon Act had been proposed before, see <em>supra</em>, at 10; the idea was that imports were subject to state law once within a State\xe2\x80\x99s geographic borders, regardless of the law\xe2\x80\x99s character.  In fact, proponents of the final version of the bill defeated proposed amendments that would have restrained States from restricting imports destined for personal use, and thereby would have left <em>Scott </em>intact.  Hamm 215; 49 Cong. Rec. 2921 (1913); see also H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 2337, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., 2\xe2\x80\x933 (1904) (prior unenacted version drawing exception for shipments for in-state personal use).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to those unenacted amendments, the Webb-Kenyon Act reversed <em>Scott, Rhodes</em>, and <em>Vance </em>by forbidding the importation of liquor \xe2\x80\x9cintended to be received, possessed, sold or in any manner used \xe2\x80\xa6 in violation of any law of such state\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the nature of the state law or the imported liquor\xe2\x80\x99s intended use.  See <em>Seaboard Air Line R. Co.,</em> 245 U. S., at 304 (noting that the Webb-Kenyon Act allowed States to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cirrespective of any personal right in a consignee there to have and consume liquor\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is why, just four years after its enactment, this Court described the Webb-Kenyon Act as removing \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection of interstate commerce away from <em>all</em> <em>receipt and possession of liquor prohibited by state law</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clark Distilling</em>, 242 U. S., at 325 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing historical account belies the majority\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Webb-Kenyon Act left <em>Scott </em>untouched.  The Court reasons that the Webb-Kenyon Act overturned only those decisions that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in effect afford[ed] a means by subterfuge and indirection to set [state liquor laws] at naught,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18 (quoting <em>Clark Distilling</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 324), a description the Court takes to cover <em>Rhodes </em>and <em>Vance</em>, but not <em>Scott</em>.  However, <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, by precluding state monopoly systems from prohibiting direct shipments of liquor to consumers, \xe2\x80\x9cset [state liquor laws] at naught\xe2\x80\x9d just as <em>Rhodes</em> and <em>Vance</em> did.  The Court concedes that the Webb-Kenyon Act \xe2\x80\x9cclose[d] the direct-shipment gap\xe2\x80\x9d and that <em>Scott </em>recognized a constitutional right for consumers to import liquor directly for their own personal use.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16, 18.  These concessions cannot be squared with Court\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321, that the Webb-Kenyon Act left <em>Scott </em>untouched.  The only way to overturn <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment holding was to abrogate its premise that South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly system was unconstitutionally discriminatory, as Senator Tillman recognized from the start.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Reversing <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a State could not ban direct shipments of liquor to consumers was a core concern of the Webb-Kenyon Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Repudiating <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination holding<em> </em>was also essential to ensuring the constitutionality of state liquor licensing schemes and state monopolies on the sale and distribution of liquor.  This is so because the constitutionality of these state systems remained in some doubt even after <em>Vance</em>.  As explained, <em>Vance </em>upheld South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly system (stripped of its ban on direct shipments) as \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d only because that system had preserved the constitutional right established in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Rhodes </em>to send and receive direct shipments of liquor free of state interference.  <em>Supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The Court admits that the Webb-Kenyon Act abolished that right.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Had the Webb-Kenyon Act done so without also allowing the States to discriminate, <em>Vance</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning implied that the Court was likely to strike down state monopoly systems, and therefore probably licensing schemes as well, as unduly \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 170 U. S., at 451 (equating a state monopoly scheme with a private licensing scheme).  The only way to stave off that holding, and so to preserve States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to regulate liquor traffic, was to overturn <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d reasoning.  Faced with a Judiciary that had narrowly construed the Wilson Act, see <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312, Congress drafted the Webb-Kenyon Act to authorize <em>all </em>state regulation of importation, whether or not \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just as <em>Rhodes </em>read the Wilson Act to repudiate <em>Leisy </em>but not <em>Bowman</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 10, the majority reads the Webb-Kenyon Act to repudiate <em>Rhodes </em>but not <em>Scott</em>, committing an analogous error.  I would not so construe the Webb-Kenyon Act.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority disagrees with this historical account primarily by disputing my reading of <em>Scott</em>.  It reads <em>Scott </em>to have held two things: first, that certain discriminatory provisions of South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly system were not authorized by the Wilson Act, and therefore were unconstitutional; and second, that Donald had a constitutional right to import liquor directly from out-of-state shippers.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  This recharacterization of <em>Scott </em>(together with its mischaracterization of <em>Rhodes</em>\xe2\x80\x99 holding, see <em>supra</em>, at 10) is the basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Webb-Kenyon Act only overruled <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second holding, leaving the first untouched.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court misreads <em>Scott</em>.  <em>Scott </em>had only one holding: that the state monopoly system unconstitutionally discriminated against Donald by allowing him to purchase liquor from in-state stores, but not directly from out-of-state interests.  The issue of direct importation was squarely at issue in <em>Scott</em>,<em> </em>not simply \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This was the only basis, after all, for affirming Donald\xe2\x80\x99s damages award for interference with his ability to import goods directly from outside the State.  <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that the South Carolina law was unconstitutionally discriminatory was the basis for affirming that award, not a separate and distinct holding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While South Carolina law also allowed the state alcohol administrator to discriminate against out-of-state liquor when purchasing liquor for sale through the monopoly system, <em>ante</em>, at 15, any constitutional defect with those portions of the law would have been at most grounds for allowing Donald to purchase out-of-state liquor through the state monopoly system, as the dissent argued (and as the majority strains to characterize <em>Scott </em>\xe2\x80\x99s actual holding, <em>ante</em>, at 16).  See 165 U. S., at 104\xe2\x80\x93106 (Brown, J., dissenting).  But <em>Scott </em>rejected that view and held that the broader discrimination effected by the law was grounds for allowing Donald to import liquor directly himself, bypassing the monopoly system entirely.  <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding therefore rested on a conclusion that a ban on direct importation was \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d under the negative Commerce Clause.  That conclusion was natural for Justice Shiras, the author of <em>Scott</em>, whose view apparently was that all state monopoly systems, even ones that seem nondiscriminatory to our modern eyes, were unconstitutionally discriminatory.  See <em>Vance</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 465, 467 (Shiras, J., dissenting) (citing the nondiscrimination cases <em>Walling</em> v. <em>Michigan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/446/index.html">116 U. S. 446</a> (1886), and <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Barber,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/136/313/index.html">136 U. S. 313</a> (1890)).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrower understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is anachronistic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Vance</em> confirms this reading of <em>Scott</em>.  <em>Vance </em>correctly characterized <em>Scott</em> as establishing a right for consumers to receive shipments of liquor directly from out-of-state sources.  170 U. S., at 452.  It also characterized <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning as resting on the discriminatory character of the state law.  170 U. S., at 449.  These two descriptions, taken together, suggest that the discriminatory character of the law was the basis for <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Donald had a constitutional right to receive liquor directly, instead of a separate holding.  Moreover, <em>Vance </em>also implied that a monopoly system that did not allow consumers to receive liquor directly was unconstitutionally discriminatory.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  That suggestion supports the idea that <em>Scott </em>considered a ban on such direct shipments to be discriminatory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Brennen</em> v. <em>Southern Express Co.</em>, 106 S.\xc2\xa0C. 102, 90 S.\xc2\xa0E. 402 (1916), likewise bolsters that <em>Scott</em> considered South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ban on direct importation to be unconstitutionally discriminatory, quite apart from the provisions that authorized the state administrator of alcohol to prefer local products over out-of-state ones.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15 (describing discriminatory provisions).  In <em>Brennen</em>, the court considered the constitutionality of a state monopoly system that channeled all liquor through state dispensaries by banning direct shipments, but that allowed a consumer to import directly one gallon of liquor per month for his own personal use.  106 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 107\xe2\x80\x93108, 90 S.\xc2\xa0E., at 403.  Though out-of-state liquor had equal access to the state run liquor dispensaries, see generally 2 S.\xc2\xa0C. Crim. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7794\xe2\x80\x93878 (1912) (providing for otherwise nondiscriminatory state-run monopoly system), the court held that this system unconstitutionally discriminated against out-of-state liquor because it allowed consumers to purchase only a limited quantity of liquor via direct shipments, yet unlimited amounts from state stores.  The court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no limit to the quantity which a citizen who patronized the dispensaries might buy and keep in his possession for personal use,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the law limited direct-shipment purchases to a specific quantity each month.  106 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 108, 90 S.\xc2\xa0E., at 403.  This, the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cwas therefore clearly a discrimination made in favor of liquors bought from the dispensaries,\xe2\x80\x9d and so was unconstitutionally discriminatory under the rule of <em>Scott</em>.  106 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 108, 90 S.\xc2\xa0E., at 403\xe2\x80\x93404.  The court thus recognized that <em>Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning<em> </em>implied that a state monopoly system was unconstitutionally discriminatory unless it allowed consumers to purchase liquor directly from out-of-state shippers on the same terms as they could purchase liquor from the state monopoly system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Brennan </em>refutes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Scott</em>.  It shows that the South Carolina system at issue in <em>Scott </em>was \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d because it banned direct importation, not because its provisions authorized the state alcohol administrator to prefer local products.  Even the Court concedes that the Webb-Kenyon Act abrogated the right to direct importation recognized in <em>Scott</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16, 18.  It follows that the Act also overturned the nondiscrimination reasoning that was the foundation of that right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Webb-Kenyon Act authorizes the discriminatory state laws before the Court today. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no need to interpret the Twenty-first Amendment, because the Webb-Kenyon Act resolves these cases.  However, the state laws the Court strikes down are lawful under the plain meaning of \xc2\xa72 of the Twenty-first Amendment, as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law in the wake of the Amendment and the contemporaneous practice of the States reinforce.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, this language tracked the Webb-Kenyon Act by authorizing state regulation that would otherwise conflict with the negative Commerce Clause.  To remove any doubt regarding its broad scope, the Amendment simplified the language of the Webb-Kenyon Act and made clear that States could regulate importation destined for in-state delivery free of negative Commerce Clause restraints.  Though the Twenty-first Amendment mirrors the basic terminology of the Webb-Kenyon Act, its language is broader, authorizing States to regulate all \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation or importation\xe2\x80\x9d that runs afoul of state law.  The broader language even more naturally encompasses discriminatory state laws.  Its terms suggest, for example, that a State may ban imports entirely while leaving in-state liquor unregulated, for they do not condition the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prohibit imports on the manner in which state law treats domestic products.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state laws at issue in these cases fall within \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s broad terms.  They prohibit wine manufacturers from \xe2\x80\x9ctransport[ing] or import[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d wine directly to consumers in New York and Michigan \xe2\x80\x9cfor delivery or use therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  Michigan law does so by requiring all out-of-state wine manufacturers to distribute wine through licensed in-state wholesalers.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  New York law does so by prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping wine directly to consumers unless they establish an in-state physical presence, something that in-state wineries naturally have.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The Twenty-first Amendment prohibits out-of-state wineries from shipping wine into Michigan and New York in violation of these laws.  In holding that the Constitution prohibits Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s laws, the majority turns the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text on its head.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding is also at odds with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s early Twenty-first Amendment case law.  In <em>State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.</em> v. <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/299/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/299/59/index.html">299 U. S. 59</a> (1936), this Court considered the constitutionality of a California law that facially discriminated against beer importers and, by extension, out-of-state producers.  The California law required wholesalers to pay a special $500 license fee to import beer, in addition to the $50 fee California charged for wholesalers to distribute beer generally.  <em>Id.</em>, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  California law thus discriminated against out-of-state beer by charging wholesalers of imported beer 11 times the fee charged to wholesalers of domestic beer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market </em>held that this explicit discrimination against out-of-state beer products came within the terms of the Twenty-first Amendment, and therefore did not run afoul of the negative Commerce Clause.  The Court reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s words are \xe2\x80\x9capt to confer upon the State the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it prescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 62.  The Court rejected the argument that a State \xe2\x80\x9cmust let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms,\xe2\x80\x9d declaring that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o say that, would involve not a construction of the Amendment, but a rewriting of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>It recognized that a State could adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d regulation of out-of-state manufacturers as an incident to a \xe2\x80\x9clesser degree of regulation than total prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, by imposing \xe2\x80\x9ca state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of beer,\xe2\x80\x9d or by \xe2\x80\x9cchannel[ing] desired importations by confining them to a single consignee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 63.  And far from \xe2\x80\x9cnot consider[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the historical argument that forms the core of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, <em>ante</em>, at 22, <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market</em> expressly rejected its relevance:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe plaintiffs argue that limitation of the broad language of the Twenty-first Amendment is sanctioned by its history; and by the decisions of this Court on the Wilson Act, the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Reed Amendment.  As we think the language of the Amendment is clear, we do not discuss these matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 U. S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe plaintiffs in <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market</em> advanced virtually the same historical argument the Court today accepts.

That logic requires sustaining the state laws that the Court invalidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market </em>was no outlier.  The next Term, the Court upheld a Minnesota law that prohibited the importation of 50-proof liquor, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination against imported liquor is permissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mahoney</em> v. <em>Joseph Triner Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/401/index.html">304 U. S. 401</a>, 403 (1938).  One Term after that, the Court upheld two state laws that prohibited the importation of liquor from States that discriminated against domestic liquor.  See <em>Indianapolis Brewing Co.</em> v. <em>Liquor Control Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/305/391/index.html">305 U.

Finch &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>McKittrick,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/305/395/index.html">305 U. S. 395</a>, 398 (1939).  In sum, the Court recognized from the start that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Twenty-first Amendment sanctions the right of a State to legislate concerning intoxicating liquors brought from without, unfettered by the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ziffrin, Inc.</em> v. <em>Reeves,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/132/index.html">308 U.

The majority gives short shrift to these persuasive contemporaneous constructions of the Twenty-first Amendment, as Justice Stevens properly stresses.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The widespread, unquestioned acceptance of the three-tier system of liquor regulation, see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and the contemporaneous practice of the States following the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment confirm that the Amendment freed the States from negative Commerce Clause restraints on discriminatory regulation.  Like the Webb-Kenyon Act, the Twenty-first Amendment was designed to remove any doubt regarding whether state monopoly and licensing schemes violated the Commerce Clause, as the majority properly acknowledges.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326; see also <em>supra, </em>at 15.  Accordingly, in response to the end of Prohibition, States that made liquor legal imposed either state monopoly systems, or licensing schemes strictly circumscribing the ability of private interests to sell and distribute liquor within state borders.  Skilton, State Power Under the Twenty-First Amendment, 7 Brooklyn L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 342, 345\xe2\x80\x93346 (1938); L.\xc2\xa0Harrison &amp; E.\xc2\xa0Laine, After Repeal: A Study of Liquor Control Administration 43 (1936).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These liquor regulation schemes discriminated against out-of-state economic interests, just as Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws do.  State monopolies that did not permit direct shipments to consumers, for example, were thought to discriminate against out-of-state wholesalers and retailers by favoring in-state products.  See <em>Vance</em>, 170 U. S., at 451\xe2\x80\x93452; <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Private licensing schemes discriminated as well, often by requiring in-state residency or physical presence as a condition of obtaining licenses.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Even today, the requirement that liquor pass through a licensed in-state wholesaler is a core component of the three-tier system.  As the Court concedes, each of these schemes is within the ambit of the Twenty-first Amendment, even though each discriminates against out-of-state interests.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many States had laws that discriminated against out-of-state products in addition to out-of-state wholesalers and retailers.  See Kallenbach, Interstate Commerce in Intoxicating Liquors Under the Twenty-First Amendment, 14 Temp. L.\xc2\xa0Q. 474, 483\xe2\x80\x93484 (1940); T. Green, Liquor Trade Barriers: Obstructions to Interstate Commerce in Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits 12\xe2\x80\x9319, and App. I (1940) (hereinafter Green).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  For example, 21 States required that producers who had no physical presence within the State first obtain a special license or certificate before doing business within the State, thus subjecting them to two layers of licensing fees.  <em>Id.</em>, at 12.  Thirteen States charged lower licensing fees for wine manufacturers who used locally grown grapes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.  Arkansas went so far as to create a blanket exception to its licensing scheme for locally produced wine. See 2 Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Digest of Stat. of Ark. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714099, 14105, 14113 (1937).  Eight States taxed out-of-state liquor products at greater rates than in-state products.  Green 13.  Twenty-nine States exempted exports from excise taxes that were applicable to imports.  <em>Id.,</em> at 14.  At least 10 States (plus the District of Columbia) imposed special licensing requirements on solicitors of out-of-state liquor products.  See Harrison &amp; Laine, <em>supra</em>, at 194\xe2\x80\x93195.  Like the California law upheld in <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market</em>, 10 States charged wholesalers who dealt in imports greater licensing fees.  Economic Localism 1150; Crabb, State Power Over Liquor Under the Twenty-First Amendment, 12 U. Det. L. J. 11, 27 (1948); Green 13.  Many States also passed antiretaliation statutes limiting or banning imports from other States that themselves discriminated against out-of-state liquor.  Economic Localism 1152; Green 14.  All told, at least 41 States had some sort of law that discriminated against out-of-state products, many if not most of which (contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 22) predated <em>Young\xe2\x80\x99s Market </em>and its progeny.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Green App. I.  This contemporaneous state practice refutes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, 25, that the Twenty-first Amendment allowed States to discriminate against out-of-state wholesalers and retailers, but not against out-of-state products.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than credit the lay consensus this state practice reflects, the Court relies instead on scattered academic and judicial commentary arguing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not permit States to enact discriminatory liquor legislation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  Most of the commentators and judges the Court cites did not adopt the construction of the Amendment the Court embraces.  For example, some argued that the Twenty-first Amendment only allowed States to enact nondiscriminatory prohibition laws\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> to allow \xe2\x80\x9cdry states to remain dry.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Note, 55 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 815, 816\xe2\x80\x93817 (1946); de Ganahl, The Scope of Federal Power Over Alcoholic Beverages Since the Twenty-First Amendment, 8 Geo.

The Court must concede this, given that state practice shows that the Twenty-first Amendment authorized such practices, and given that the Webb-Kenyon Act allowed States to enforce their own licensing laws, even if they did not prohibit the use and consumption of liquor entirely.  Others apparently defended the position that the Twenty-first Amendment did no more than prevent Congress from permitting the direct importation of liquor into a State, leaving the Constitution untouched.

The pre-Twenty-first Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cnondiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d principle enshrined in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause cases could not have prohibited discrimination against the producers of out-of-state goods, while permitting discrimination against out-of-state services like wholesaling and retailing.  See <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>BT Investment Managers, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/27/index.html">447 U.

But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s later cases do not require the result the majority reaches.

In <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Dias,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/263/index.html">468 U. S. 263</a> (1984), this Court established a standard for determining when a discriminatory state liquor regulation is permissible under the Twenty-first Amendment.  At issue in <em>Bacchus</em> was a Hawaii statute that imposed a 20 percent excise tax on liquor, but exempted certain locally produced products from the tax.  The Court held that the Twenty-first Amendment did not save the discriminatory tax.  The Court reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment did not permit state laws that constituted \xe2\x80\x9cmere economic protectionism,\xe2\x80\x9d because the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccentral purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 276.  The Court noted that the State did \xe2\x80\x9cnot seek to justify its tax on the ground that it was designed to promote temperance or to carry out any other purpose of the Twenty-first Amendment, but instead acknowledg[ed] that the purpose was \xe2\x80\x98to promote a local industry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting Brief for Appellee Dias, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1983, No. 82\xe2\x80\x931565, p.\xc2\xa040).  The Court therefore struck down the tax, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [it] violate[d] a central tenet of the Commerce Clause but [was] not supported by any clear concern of the Twenty-first Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  468 U.

Allowing States to regulate the direct shipment of liquor was of \xe2\x80\x9cclear concern\xe2\x80\x9d to the framers of the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Twenty-first Amendment.  <em>Bacchus</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 276.  The driving force behind the passage of the Webb-Kenyon Act was a desire to reverse this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions that had precluded States from regulating the direct shipment of liquor by out-of-state interests.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The laws struck down in <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Donald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/58/index.html"></a><a href="/us/165/58/index.html">165 U. S. 58</a> (1897), and <em>Vance</em> v. <em>W. A. Vandercook Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/170/438/index.html"></a><a href="/us/170/438/index.html"></a><a href="/us/170/438/index.html">170 U.

By contrast, there is little evidence that purely protectionist tax exemptions like those at issue in <em>Bacchus </em>were of any concern to the framers of the Act and the Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, if the three-tier liquor regulation system falls within the \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d of the Twenty-first Amendment, then so do Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws.  The same justifications for requiring wholesalers and retailers to be in-state businesses equally apply to Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws.  For example, States require liquor to be shipped through in-state wholesalers because it is easier to regulate in-state wholesalers and retailers.  State officials can better enforce their regulations by inspecting the premises and attaching the property of in-state entities; \xe2\x80\x9c[p]resence ensures accountability.\xe2\x80\x9d  358 F.\xc2\xa03d 223, 237 (CA2 2004).  It is therefore understandable that the framers of the Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act would have wanted to free States to discriminate between in-state and out-of-state wholesalers and retailers, especially in the absence of the modern technological improvements and federal enforcement mechanisms that the Court argues now make regulating liquor easier.  <em>Ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s laws simply allow some in-state wineries to act as their own wholesalers and retailers in limited circumstances.  If allowing a State to require all<em> </em>wholesalers and retailers to be in-state companies is a core concern of the Twenty-first Amendment, so is allowing a State to select only in-state manufacturers to ship directly to consumers, and therefore act, in effect, as their own wholesalers and retailers.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court places much weight upon the authority of <em>Bacchus</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  This is odd, because the Court does not even mention, let alone apply, the \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d test that <em>Bacchus </em>established.  The Court instead <em>sub silentio</em> casts aside that test, employing otherwise-applicable negative Commerce Clause scrutiny and giving no weight to the Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312, 26\xe2\x80\x9330.  The Court therefore at least implicitly acknowledges the unprincipled nature of the test <em>Bacchus</em> established and the grave departure <em>Bacchus </em>was from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  See 468 U. S., at 278\xe2\x80\x93287 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>James B. Beam Distilling Co.</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/529/index.html">501 U.

It swept aside the weighty authority of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s early Twenty-first Amendment case law, see 468 U. S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93282 (Stevens, J., dissenting), because the <em>Bacchus</em> Court thought it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an absurd oversimplification\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Twenty-first Amendment has somehow operated to \xe2\x80\x9crepeal\xe2\x80\x9d the Commerce Clause,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 275 (quoting <em>Hostetter</em> v. <em>Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/324/index.html">377 U. S. 324</a>, 331\xe2\x80\x93332 (1964)).  The Twenty-first Amendment did not impliedly repeal the Commerce Clause, but that does not justify <em>Bacchus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 narrowing of the Twenty-first Amendment to its \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text has more modest effect than <em>Bacchus </em>supposed.  Though its terms are broader than the Webb-Kenyon Act, the Twenty-first Amendment also parallels the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structure.  In particular, the Twenty-first Amendment provides that any importation into a State contrary to state law violates the Constitution, just as the Webb-Kenyon Act provides that any such importation contrary to state law violates federal law.  Its use of those same terms of art shows that just as the Webb-Kenyon Act repealed liquor\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause immunity, the Twenty-first Amendment likewise insulates state liquor laws from negative Commerce Clause scrutiny.  Authorizing States to regulate liquor importation free from negative Commerce Clause restraints is a far cry from precluding Congress from regulating in that field at all.  See <em>Bacchus</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 279, n.\xc2\xa05 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Moreover, <em>Bacchus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 concern that the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Commerce Clause is no excuse for ignoring the independent force of the Webb-Kenyon Act, which equally divested discriminatory state liquor laws of Commerce Clause immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stripped of <em>Bacchus</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is bereft of support in our cases.  <em>Bacchus </em>is the only decision of this Court holding that the Twenty-first Amendment does not authorize the in-state regulation of imported liquor free of the negative Commerce Clause.  Given the uniformity of our early case law supporting even discriminatory state laws regulating imports into States, then, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s laws easily pass muster under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, in support of <em>Bacchus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 holding that \xe2\x80\x9cstate regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court cites <em>Brown&amp;nbhyph;Forman Distillers Corp.</em> v. <em>New York State Liquor Authority,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/476/573/index.html">476 U. S. 573</a> (1986), and <em>Healy</em> v. <em>Beer Institute,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/324/index.html">491 U. S. 324</a> (1989).  <em>Ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  At issue in those cases was the constitutionality of protectionist legislation that controlled the price of liquor in other States.  <em>Brown-Forman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 582\xe2\x80\x93583; <em>Healy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 337\xe2\x80\x93338.  In invalidating such a statute, <em>Brown-Forman </em>found that the Twenty-first Amendment, by its terms, gives \xe2\x80\x9cNew York only the authority to control sales of liquor in New York, and confers no authority to control sales in other States.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 585; see also <em>Healy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343 (following <em>Brown-Forman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s construction).  <em>Brown-Forman</em> and <em>Healy </em>are beside the point in these cases.  <em>Brown-Forman </em>did not involve a facially discriminatory law.  See 476 U. S., at 579.  And unlike <em>Healy</em>, there is no claim here that the Michigan and New York laws do anything but regulate within their own borders, thereby interfering with the ability of other States to exercise their own Twenty-first Amendment power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally inapposite are the cases the Court cites concerning state laws that violate other provisions of the Constitution or Acts of Congress.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  Cases involving the relation between the Twenty-first Amendment and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 affirmative Commerce Clause power are irrelevant to whether the Twenty-first Amendment protects state power against the negative implications of the Commerce Clause.  See <em>James B. Beam</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 556 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); <em>Bacchu</em>s, <em>supra</em>, at 279, and n.\xc2\xa05 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Similarly, my interpretation of the Twenty-first Amendment would not free States to regulate liquor unhampered by other constitutional restraints, like the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.  As this Court explained in <em>Craig</em> v. <em>Boren,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/index.html">429 U. S. 190</a>, 205\xe2\x80\x93207 (1976), the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment demonstrate that it displaces liquor\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause immunity, not other constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court begins its opinion by detailing the evils of state laws that restrict the direct shipment of wine.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  It stresses, for example, the Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that allowing the direct shipment of wine would enhance consumer welfare.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on these effects suggests that it believes that its decision serves this Nation well.  I am sure that the judges who repeatedly invalidated state liquor legislation, even in the face of clear congressional direction to the contrary, thought the same.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9312.  The Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act took those policy choices away from judges and returned them to the States.  Whatever the wisdom of that choice, the Court does this Nation no service by ignoring the textual commands of the Constitution and Acts of Congress.  The Twenty-first Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act displaced the negative Commerce Clause as applied to regulation of liquor imports into a State.  They require sustaining the constitutionality of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Webb-Kenyon Act provides:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe shipment or transportation, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of any spiritous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind from one State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, into any other State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or from any foreign country into any State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, which said spiritous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, is prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  27 U.

The Court takes this word out of context.  By \xe2\x80\x9cvalid\xe2\x80\x9d laws, <em>McCormick</em> meant laws not pre-empted by the National Prohibition Act, rather than laws that treated in-state and out-of-state products equally.

That is not correct.  It is settled that the Webb-Kenyon Act explicitly abrogates negative Commerce Clause review of state laws that fall within its terms.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  There is no reason to require another clear statement for each sort of law to which it might apply.  The only question is whether, fairly read, the Webb-Kenyon Act covers Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s direct-shipment laws.

It does not.  The Wilson Act \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes\xe2\x80\x9d States from nothing.
