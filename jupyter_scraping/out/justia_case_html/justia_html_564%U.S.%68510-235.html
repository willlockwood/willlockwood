He filed suit under the Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable for employees\xe2\x80\x99 injuries \xe2\x80\x9cresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751.  McBride alleged that CSX negligently (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to train him to operate that equipment.  A verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX\xe2\x80\x99s  negligence \xe2\x80\x9ccaused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x9d his injury.  The court declined CSX\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional charges requiring McBride to \xe2\x80\x9cshow that \xe2\x80\xa6 [CSX\xe2\x80\x99s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury\xe2\x80\x9d and defining \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury complained of.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, relying on <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html">352 U. S. 500</a>, the court gave the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s pattern FELA instruction: \xe2\x80\x9cDefendant \xe2\x80\x98caused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x99 Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury if Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence played a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury returned a verdict for McBride.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  The appeals court, however, approved the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction and affirmed its judgment for McBride.  Because <em>Rogers</em> had relaxed the proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an instruction that simply paraphrased <em>Rogers\xe2\x80\x99</em> language could not be declared erroneous.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, concluding, in accord with FELA\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose, <em>Rogers,</em> and the uniform view of the federal appellate courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions.  The charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad \xe2\x80\x9ccaused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x9d a railroad worker\xe2\x80\x99s injury \xe2\x80\x9cif [the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s] negligence played a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation in FELA cases.

S. 163</a>, 181, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chumanitarian\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cremedial goal[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in enacting the statute, FELA\xe2\x80\x99s causation standard is \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation, <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html">512 U. S. 532</a>, 542\xe2\x80\x93543.  <em>Rogers</em> described that relaxed standard as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 506.  Because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction tracked <em>Rogers</em>\xe2\x80\x99 language, the instruction was plainly proper so long as <em>Rogers</em> actually prescribes the causation definition applicable under FELA.  See <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 172.  CSX, however, contends that <em>Rogers </em>was a narrowly focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Drawing largely on Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in<em> Norfolk Southern R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/158/index.html">549 U. S. 158</a>, 173, CSX urges that <em>Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 </em>\xe2\x80\x9cany part \xe2\x80\xa6 in producing the injury\xe2\x80\x9d test displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contributory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the requisite directness of a cause.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0In <em>Rogers,</em> the employee was burning vegetation that lined his employer\xe2\x80\x99s railroad tracks.  A passing train fanned the flames, which spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing.  Attempting to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries.  352 U. S., at 501\xe2\x80\x93503.  The state-court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire.  As the fire \xe2\x80\x9cwas something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel,\xe2\x80\x9d the court found that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury was not the natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This Court reversed.  FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incorporate any traditional common-law formulation of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 506.  Whether the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligent act was the \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate reason\xe2\x80\x9d for the fall, the Court added, was \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 503.  The Court then announced its \xe2\x80\x9cany part \xe2\x80\xa6 in producing the injury\xe2\x80\x9d test, <em>id.</em>, at 506.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rogers</em> is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of FELA\xe2\x80\x99s causation standard.  The State Supreme Court there acknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but considered the respondent railroad\xe2\x80\x99s part too indirect to establish the requisite causation.  That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in <em>Rogers</em>.  It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.  The interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory history, see <em>Trainmen</em> v. <em>Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/1/index.html">377 U. S. 1</a>, 3, the precedents on which <em>Rogers </em>drew, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Coray</em> v. <em>Southern Pacific Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/520/index.html">335 U. S. 520</a>, 523\xe2\x80\x93524, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent decisions, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ferguson</em> v. <em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/521/index.html">352 U. S. 521</a>, 523\xe2\x80\x93524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews FELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and scholars.  This understanding of <em>Rogers</em> \xe2\x80\x9chas been accepted as settled law for several decades.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 32.  To discard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve <em>stare decisis.  </em>Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0CSX nonetheless worries that the <em>Rogers</em> \xe2\x80\x9cany part\xe2\x80\x9d instruction opens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation.  A half century\xe2\x80\x99s experience with <em>Rogers </em>gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even <em>one</em> trial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward award.  </p>\n<p>\n\nFELA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language is straightforward.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of [FELA] <em>negligence</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gallick</em> v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/108/index.html">372 U. S. 108</a>, 117 (emphasis added).  If negligence is proved, however, and is shown to have \xe2\x80\x9cplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rogers</em>, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in damages even if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9c[p]robable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gallick</em>, 372 U.

Properly instructed on negligence and causation, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no warrant to award damages in far out \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d scenarios, and judges would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.

S. C. \xc2\xa751 <em>et seq</em>.  FELA renders railroads liable for employees\xe2\x80\x99 injuries or deaths \xe2\x80\x9cresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.  In accord with the text and purpose of the Act, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/500/index.html">352 U. S. 500</a> (1957), and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we conclude that the Act does not incorporate \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions.  The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, simply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a plaintiff employee\xe2\x80\x99s injury if the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence played any part in bringing about the injury.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive engineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which operates an interstate system of railroads.  On April 12, 2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run between Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.  The run involved frequent starts and stops to add and remove individual rail cars, a process known as \xe2\x80\x9cswitching.\xe2\x80\x9d  The train McBride was to operate had an unusual engine configuration: two \xe2\x80\x9cwide-body\xe2\x80\x9d engines followed \nby three smaller conventional cabs.  McBride protested that the configuration was unsafe, because switching with heavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand-operated independent brake.  But he was told to take the train as is.  About ten hours into the run, McBride injured his hand while using the independent brake.  Despite two surgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never regained full use of the hand.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride commenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  He alleged that CSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him to use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed to train him to operate that equipment.  App. 24a\xe2\x80\x9326a.  A verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX \xe2\x80\x9cwas negligent\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cnegligence caused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x9d McBride\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to give.  One of the rejected instructions would have required \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff [to] show that \xe2\x80\xa6 the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was a proximate cause of the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34a.  Another would have defined \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury complained of,\xe2\x80\x9d with the qualification that a proximate cause \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be the only cause, nor the last or nearest cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 32a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride requested, the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s pattern instruction for FELA cases, which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant \xe2\x80\x98caused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x99 Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury if Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence played a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the injury.  The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 31a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nFor this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R.

The jury returned a verdict for McBride, setting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that amount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.  App. 29a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob-jection to the failure to instruct on \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Before the appellate court, CSX \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ed] that the correct definition of proximate causation is a \xe2\x80\x98direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  598 F.\xc2\xa03d 388, 393, n.\xc2\xa03 (2010) (quoting <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/258/index.html">503 U. S. 258</a>, 268 (1992)).  A properly instructed jury, CSX contended, might have found that the chain of causation was too indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe because of its propensity to cause crashes during switching, not because of any risk to an engineer\xe2\x80\x99s hands.

In our 1957 decision in <em>Rogers</em>, we described that relaxed standard as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 506.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the District Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for McBride if \xe2\x80\x9c[railroad] negligence played a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the injury,\xe2\x80\x9d tracked the language of <em>Rogers</em>.  If <em>Rogers</em> prescribes the definition of causation applicable under FELA, that instruction was plainly proper.  See <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U.

While CSX does not ask us to disturb <em>Rogers</em>, the railroad contends that lower courts have overread that opinion.  In CSX\xe2\x80\x99s view, shared by the dissent, <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not touch, concern, much less displace common-law formulations of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Understanding this argument requires some background.  The <em>term</em> \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d is shorthand for a concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise to legal liability.  See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, \nR. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa742, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we . . . mean by the word \xe2\x80\x98proximate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d one noted jurist has explained, is simply this: \xe2\x80\x9c[B]ecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Island R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 248 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 339, 352, 162 N.\xc2\xa0E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting).  Common-law \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d formulations varied, and were often both constricted and difficult to comprehend.  See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73\xe2\x80\x9377, 812\xe2\x80\x93813 (2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions precluding recovery in the event of any \xe2\x80\x9cintervening\xe2\x80\x9d cause or any contributory negligence).  Some courts cut off liability if a \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d was not the <em>sole</em> proximate cause.  Prosser and Keeton \xc2\xa765, p. 452 (noting \xe2\x80\x9ctendency \xe2\x80\xa6 to look for some single, principal, dominant, \xe2\x80\x98proximate\xe2\x80\x99 cause of every injury\xe2\x80\x9d).

The employee in that case was injured while burning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s railroad tracks.  A passing train had fanned the flames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a culvert where the employee was standing.  Attempting to escape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries.  352 U. S., at 501\xe2\x80\x93503.  A Missouri state-court jury returned a verdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire.  <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Thompson</em>, 284 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d \n467, 472 (Mo. 1955).  As the fire \xe2\x80\x9cwas something extraordi-nary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel,\xe2\x80\x9d the court felt \xe2\x80\x9cobliged to say [that] plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury was not the natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We held that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict should not have been upset.  Describing two potential readings of the Missouri Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, we condemned both.  First, the court erred in concluding that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was the \xe2\x80\x9csole\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably found that railroad negligence played a part.  Rogers</em>, 352 U. S., at 504\xe2\x80\x93505.  Second, the court erred insofar as it held that the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was not a sufficient cause unless it was the more \xe2\x80\x9cprobable\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the injury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 505.  FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate any traditional common-law formulation of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 506.  Whether the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligent act was the \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate reason\xe2\x80\x9d for the fall, we added, was \xe2\x80\x9can irrelevant consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 503.  We then announced the \xe2\x80\x9cany part\xe2\x80\x9d test, <em>id.</em>, at 506, and reiterated it several times.

Notably, the Missouri Supreme Court in <em>Rogers</em> did not doubt that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, including railroad negligence and employee negligence.  See 284 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 472 (reciting FELA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language).

It is also the reasoning CSX asks us to resurrect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our understanding is informed by the statutory history and precedent on which <em>Rogers </em>drew.  Before FELA was enacted, the \xe2\x80\x9charsh and technical\xe2\x80\x9d rules of state common law had \xe2\x80\x9cmade recovery difficult or even impossible\xe2\x80\x9d for in-jured railroad workers.  <em>Trainmen</em> v. <em>Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/1/index.html">377 U.

Aiming to end lower court disre-\ngard of congressional purpose, the <em>Rogers</em> Court repeatedly called the \xe2\x80\x9cany part\xe2\x80\x9d test the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>single</em>\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry determining causation in FELA cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 507, 508 (emphasis added).  In short, CSX\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the <em>Rogers</em> standard concerns only division of responsibility among multiple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the thrust of our decision in that case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tellingly, in announcing the \xe2\x80\x9cany part \xe2\x80\xa6 in producing the injury\xe2\x80\x9d test, <em>Rogers</em> cited <em>Coray</em> v. <em>Southern Pacific Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/520/index.html"></a><a href="/us/335/520/index.html">335 U.

What qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cproximate\xe2\x80\x9d or legally sufficient cause in FELA cases, <em>Coray </em>had explained, was determined by the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresulting in whole or in part,\xe2\x80\x9d which Congress \xe2\x80\x9cselected \xe2\x80\xa6 to fix liability\xe2\x80\x9d in language that was \xe2\x80\x9csimple and direct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 524.

The very day <em>Rogers</em> was announced, we applied its \xe2\x80\x9cany part\xe2\x80\x9d instruction in a case in which the sole causation issue was the directness or foreseeability of the connection between the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s negligence and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.

Indeed, judges would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.  See <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Erie R.

As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 4, the statute confines the universe of compensable injuries to those sustained by employees, during employment.  \xc2\xa751.  Hence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases.

If taken to mean the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury must <em>probably</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d) follow from the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresulting in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language would be blunted.  Railroad negligence would \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d cause a worker\xe2\x80\x99s in-jury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to the injury, not merely a contributor in any part.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause terminology.

Co.</em>, 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837) (Story, J.).  The Court today holds that this principle does not apply to actions under the Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act (FELA), and that those suing under that statute may recover for injuries that were not proximately caused by the negligence\nof their employers.  This even though we have held that FELA generally follows the common law, unless the Act expressly provides otherwise; even though FELA expressly abrogated common law rules in four other respects, but said nothing about proximate cause; and even though our own cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA, repeatedly recognized that proximate cause was required for recovery under that statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar element of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an ele-ment \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally thought to be a necessary limitation on liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Exxon Co., U. S. A.</em> v. <em>Sofec, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/830/index.html">517 U. S. 830</a>, 838 (1996).  The test the Court would substitute\xe2\x80\x94whether negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\xe2\x80\x94is no limit at all.  It is simply \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation.  Nothing in FELA itself, or our decision in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/500/index.html">352 U.

When Congress creates such a federal tort, \xe2\x80\x9cwe start from the premise\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cadopts the background of general tort law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Staub</em> v. <em>Proctor Hospital</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5).  With respect to FELA in particular, we have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent express language to the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sorrell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 165\xe2\x80\x93166; see <em>Urie</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/163/index.html">337 U. S. 163</a>, 182 (1949).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recovery for negligence has always required a showing of proximate cause.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98In a philosophical sense, the con-sequences of an act go forward to eternity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html">503 U.

Law, however, is not philosophy, and the concept of proximate cause developed at common law in response to the perceived need to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause from those more direct causes of injury that can form the basis for liability at law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality breaks no new ground in criticizing the variety of formulations of the concept of proximate cause, <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315; courts, commentators, and first-year law students have been doing that for generations.  See <em>Exxon</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 838.  But it is often easier to disparage the product of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible substitute\xe2\x80\x94which may explain why Congress did not at-tempt to do so in FELA.  Proximate cause is hardly the only enduring common law concept that is useful despite its imprecision, see <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is in good company with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness, and unconscionability\xe2\x80\x94to name just a few.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that before recovery is allowed in tort, there must be \xe2\x80\x9csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Holmes</em>, 503 U. S., at 268.  It excludes from the scope of liability injuries that are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo remote,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpurely contingent,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cindirect[\xc2\xa0].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 268, 271, 274.  Recognizing that liability must not attach to \xe2\x80\x9cevery conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing,\xe2\x80\x9d proximate cause requires a \xe2\x80\x9ccausal connection between the wrong and the injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Carpenters</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/index.html">459 U. S. 519</a>, 536, 533, n. 26 (1983), that is not so \xe2\x80\x9ctenuous \xe2\x80\xa6 that what is claimed to be consequence is only fortuity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Exxon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 838 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It limits liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom.  When FELA was passed, as now, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question whether damage in a given case is proximate or remote [was] one of great importance\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]he determination of it determines legal right,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 T. Street, Foundations of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles in four specific ways.  See <em>Sorrell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 166, 168; <em>Con-solidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html">512 U. S. 532</a>, 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (1994).  As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the common law contributory negligence rule, which barred plaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their injuries from recovering for the negligence of another.  See Act of Apr. 22, \xc2\xa73, 35 Stat. 66.  FELA also abandoned the so-called fellow-servant rule,<em> </em>\xc2\xa71, prohibited an assumption of risk defense in certain cases, \xc2\xa74, and barred employees from contractually releasing their employers from liability, \xc2\xa75.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory alterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottshall, supra,</em> at 544 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FELA did not abolish the familiar requirement of proximate cause.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ex-pressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines\xe2\x80\x9d\nin FELA but \xe2\x80\x9cdid not deal at all with [other] equally well-established doctrine[s],\xe2\x80\x9d I do not believe that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] <em>sub silentio</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Monessen Southwestern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/330/index.html">486 U. S. 330</a>, 337\xe2\x80\x93338 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have applied the standard requirement of proximate cause to actions under federal statutes where the text did not expressly provide for it.  See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/336/index.html">544 U. S. 336</a>, 342\xe2\x80\x93346 (2005) (securities fraud); <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 268\xe2\x80\x93270 (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 529\xe2\x80\x93535 (Clayton Act); cf. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co.</em> v. <em>People Against Nuclear Energy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/766/index.html">460 U.

The jury instruction on causation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of FELA, 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But nothing in Section 1 is similar to the \xe2\x80\x9cexpress language\xe2\x80\x9d Congress employed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate a common law rule, <em>Sorrell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 165\xe2\x80\x93166.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa753 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa754 (\xe2\x80\x9cemployee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the very first section of the statute, Section 1 simply outlines who could be sued by whom and for what types\nof injuries.  It provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very common carrier by railroad \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier \xe2\x80\xa6 for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory seems to be that the words \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d signal a departure from the historic requirement of proximate cause.  But those words served a very different purpose.  They did indeed mark an important departure from a common law principle, but it was the principle of contributory negligence\xe2\x80\x94not proximate cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory negligence; the \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language simply re-flected the fact that the railroad would remain liable\neven if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury.  See <em>Sorrell</em>, 549 U. S.<em>,</em> at 170.  The Congress that was so clear when it was abolishing common law limits on recovery elsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental principle of proximate cause in the oblique manner the Court suggests.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f Congress had intended such a sea change\xe2\x80\x9d in negligence principles \xe2\x80\x9cit would have said so clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em> v. <em>Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.</em>, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language the Court adopts as an instruction on causation requires only that negligence have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (quoting <em>Rogers</em>, 352 U. S., at 506; emphasis deleted); see also <em>ante,</em> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (\xe2\x80\x9cJuries in such cases are properly instructed that a defendant railroad \xe2\x80\x98caused or contributed to\xe2\x80\x99 a railroad worker\xe2\x80\x99s injury \xe2\x80\x98if [the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s] negligence played a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the injury\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  If that is proved, \xe2\x80\x9cthen the carrier is answerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred was not \xe2\x80\x98[p]robable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98foreseeable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  There is nothing in that language that requires anything other than \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause.  The terms \xe2\x80\x9ceven the slightest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno matter how small\xe2\x80\x9d make clear to juries that even the faintest whisper of \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation will do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At oral argument, counsel for McBride explained that the correct standard for recovery under FELA is \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for plus a relaxed form of legal cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.  There is no \xe2\x80\x9cplus\xe2\x80\x9d in the rule the Court announces today.  In this very case defense counsel was free to argue \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause pure and simple to the jury.  In closing, counsel informed the jury: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we also have to show is defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence caused or contributed to [McBride\xe2\x80\x99s] injury.  It<em> </em>never would have happened <em>but for </em>[CSX] giving him that train.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At certain points in its opinion, the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]njuries have countless causes,\xe2\x80\x9d not all of which \xe2\x80\x9cshould give rise to legal liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.

Roberts, Federal Li-abilities of Carriers \xc2\xa7538, p. 942 (1918).  As Justice Souter has explained, for the half century after the enactment\nof FELA, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently recognized and applied proximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sorrell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 174 (concurring  opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No matter.  For the Court, time begins in 1957, with our opinion in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/500/index.html">352 U. S. 500</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That opinion, however, \xe2\x80\x9cleft this law where it was.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sor-rell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 174 (Souter, J., concurring).  A jury in that case awarded Rogers damages against his railroad employer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the jury verdict.  As the Court explains today, we suggested in <em>Rogers</em> that there were \xe2\x80\x9ctwo potential readings\xe2\x80\x9d of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and that both were wrong.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA\xe2\x80\x99s elimination of the common law contributory negligence rule.  We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and abrogate the rule of proximate cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we rejected the idea \xe2\x80\x9cthat [Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s] conduct was the <em>sole cause </em>of his mishap.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 504 (emphasis added); contra, <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, 284 S. W. 2d 467, 472 (Mo. 1955) (while \xe2\x80\x9c[Rogers] was confronted by an emergency[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 it was an emergency brought about by himself\xe2\x80\x9d).  There were, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cprobative facts from which the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that [Rogers] \xe2\x80\xa6 would suffer just such an injury as he did<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  352 U. S., at 503.  We noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommon experience teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames of a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the danger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we<em> </em>described\xe2\x80\x94in familiar terms\xe2\x80\x94sufficient evi-dence of proximate cause.  We therefore held that the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s injury regardless of whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe<em> immediate </em>reason\xe2\x80\x9d why Rogers slipped was the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence in permitting gravel to remain on the surface or some other cause.  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rogers</em> thereby clarified that, under a statute in which employer and employee could both be proximate causes of an injury, a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence need not be the sole or last cause in order to be proximate.  That is an application of proximate cause, not a repudiation of it.  See Street 111 (\xe2\x80\x9ca cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to be considered its effective legal cause without by any means being the nearest or most proximate to the causes which contribute of the injury\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7180, p. 445 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We then considered a second interpretation.  The Missouri Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion could alternatively be read as having held that Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconduct was <em>at least as probable a cause</em> for his mishap as any negligence of the [railroad],\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x94in those circumstances\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere was no case for the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).  If this was the principle the court applied below, it was also wrong and for many of the same reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multiple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence need not be the \xe2\x80\x9csole, efficient, produc-\ning cause of injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 506.  The question was simply whether \xe2\x80\x9cemployer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not matter,\xe2\x80\x9d we continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, <em>including the employee\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court today takes the \xe2\x80\x9cany part, even the slightest\xe2\x80\x9d language out of context and views it as a rejection of proximate cause.  But <em>Rogers </em>was talking about contributory negligence\xe2\x80\x94it said so\xe2\x80\x94and the language it chose confirms just that.  \xe2\x80\x9cSlight\xe2\x80\x9d negligence was familiar usage in this context.  The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed just two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from contributory to comparative negligence.  It provided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib-utory negligence was slight and that of the employer\nwas gross in comparison.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 11, 1906, \xc2\xa72, 34 Stat. 232.  Other statutes similarly made this halfway stop on the road from contributory to pure comparative negligence, again using the term \xe2\x80\x9cslight.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dobbs \xc2\xa7201, at 503 (\xe2\x80\x9cOne earlier [version of comparative fault] \xe2\x80\xa6 allowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was slight and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s gross\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Modern comparative negligence law works differently, reducing the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s recovery in proportion to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s fault\xe2\x80\x9d); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence \xc2\xa72.01[b][2], p. 33 (5th ed. 2010) (a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor form of modified comparative negligence is the \xe2\x80\x98slight-gross\xe2\x80\x99 system\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id. </em>\xc2\xa73.04[b], at\n75.  In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure comparative negligence with respect to rail workers.  See Dobbs \xc2\xa7201, at 503.  Under FELA, it does not matter whose negligence was \xe2\x80\x9cslight\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgross.\xe2\x80\x9d  The use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ceven the slightest\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Rogers </em>makes perfect sense when the decision is understood to be about multiple causes\xe2\x80\x94not about how direct any particular cause must be.  See <em>Sorrell</em>, 549 U. S., at 175 (Souter, J., concurring) (pertinent language concerned \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplicity of causations,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessary directness of \xe2\x80\xa6 causation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court views <em>Rogers</em> as \xe2\x80\x9cdescrib[ing] the test for proximate causation\xe2\x80\x9d under FELA, <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), but <em>Rogers </em>itself says nothing of the sort.  See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as \xe2\x80\x9cthe test <em>of a jury case</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  <em>Rogers </em>did not set forth a novel standard for proximate cause\xe2\x80\x94much less an instruction designed to guide jurors in determining causation.  Indeed, the trial court in <em>Rogers</em> used the term \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d in its jury instruction and directed the jury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries \xe2\x80\x9cwere not directly \xe2\x80\xa6 caused by\xe2\x80\x9d the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.  <em>Id.,</em> at 505, n.\xc2\xa09 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our opinion quoted that instruction, <em>ibid.</em>, but \xe2\x80\x9ctook no issue with [it] in this respect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sorrell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 176 (Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few of our<em> </em>cases have characterized <em>Rogers </em>as hold-\ning that \xe2\x80\x9ca relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottshall</em>, 512 U.

Fair enough; but these passing summations of <em>Rogers </em>do not alter its holding.  FELA did, of course, change common law rules relating to causation in one respect:  Under FELA, a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause of an injury.  See <em>Gottshall</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress did away with several common-law tort defenses \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Specifically, the statute \xe2\x80\xa6 rejected the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negligence\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, unlike under FELA\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the proportionate degree of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s negligence would not necessarily bar his recovery.  But we have never held\xe2\x80\x94until today\xe2\x80\x94that FELA entirely eliminates proximate cause as a limit on liability.</p>\n<p align="left">III </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is correct that the federal courts of appeals have read <em>Rogers</em> to support the adoption of instructions like the one given here.  But we do not resolve questions such as the one before us by a show of hands.

Under these circumstances, it seems important to correct an interpretation of our own case law that has run, so to speak, off its own rails.<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the Court seems to appreciate that it is creating a troubling gap in the FELA negligence action and ought to do <em>something </em>to patch it over.  The something it proposes is \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Foreseeability as a test for proximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability has, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause.  But that is not the test the Court prescribes.  It instead limits the foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was negligent in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence depends on \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a reasonably prudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a potential for harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 L. Sand et\xc2\xa0al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions\xe2\x80\x93Civil \xc2\xb689.10, p. 89\xe2\x80\x9321 (2010); see <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  That\xe2\x80\x99s all fine and good when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence results directly in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury (nevermind that no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable foreseeability\xe2\x80\x9d instruction was given in this case).  For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it falls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent and could have foreseen that the piano would hit someone\xe2\x80\x94as, in fact, it did.  The problem for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test arises when the negligence does not directly produce the injury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the sidewalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling down the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen have placed around their worksite, and is injured.  Was\nI negligent in dropping the piano because I could have foreseen \xe2\x80\x9c<em>a </em>mishap and injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)?  Yes.  Did my negligence cause \xe2\x80\x9c[<em>the</em>] mishap and injury\xe2\x80\x9d that resulted?  It depends on what is meant by cause.  My negligence was a \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the injury: If I had not dropped the piano, the bicyclist would not have crashed.  But is it a legal cause?  No.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In one respect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test is needlessly rigid.  If courts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect of negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as an aspect of causation?  And if the jury is simply supposed to intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain of causation\xe2\x80\x94and that \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause is not enough\xe2\x80\x94why hide the ball?  Why not simply tell the jury?  Finally, if\nthe Court intends \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeability of harm\xe2\x80\x9d to be a kind\nof poorman\xe2\x80\x99s proximate cause, then where does the Court find that requirement<em> </em>in the test <em>Rogers</em>\xe2\x80\x94or FELA\xe2\x80\x94pre-scribes?  Could it be derived from the common law?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where does \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeability of harm\xe2\x80\x9d as the sole protection against limitless liability run out of steam?  An answer would seem only fair to the common law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which overheats.  An employee becomes hot while repairing it and removes his jacket.  When finished with the repairs, he grabs a thermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare arm, burning it.  Was the risk that someone would be harmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable?  Was the risk that an employee would be burned while repairing the overheated boiler foreseeable?  Can the railroad be liable under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test for the coffee burn?  According to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it does not matter that the \xe2\x80\x9cmanner in which [the injury] occurred was not \xe2\x80\xa6 foreseeable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17 (internal quotation marks omitted), so long as some negligence\xe2\x80\x94any negligence at all\xe2\x80\x94can be established.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion fails to settle on a single test for answering these questions: Is it that the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence \xe2\x80\x9cpla[y] a part\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94in bringing about the [plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] injury,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court indicates on pages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that \xe2\x80\x9cnegligence play any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury,\xe2\x80\x9d as suggested at pages 8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17?  The Court says there is no difference, see<em> ante</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa03, but I suspect lawyers litigating FELA cases will prefer one instruction over the other, depending on whether they represent the employer or the employee.  In any event, if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94whichever version\xe2\x80\x94provides answers to these hypo-theticals, the Court keeps them to itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering such questions.  It is useful to ask whether the injury that resulted was within the scope of the risk created by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligent act; whether the injury was a natural or probable consequence of the negligence; whether there was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the negligence was anything more than an antecedent event without which the harm would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test and have been criticized for that.  But they do \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon</em>, 517 U.
