On the first hearing, the Court of Claims made special findings of fact and decided as a conclusion of law that respondent\'s patent was valid and had been infringed by the United States, and that respondent was entitled to compensation.  Judgment was entered accordingly.  81 Ct.Cls. 785.  On review by writ of certiorari, this Court held that validity and infringement were ultimate facts to be found by the Court of Claims and, as these facts had not been found, the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to that court with instructions to find specifically whether respondent\'s patent was valid, and, if so, whether it had been infringed.  <em>United States v.

Claims 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the Esnault-Pelterie patent in suit are valid."</p>\n<p>"XLIX.  The three alleged infringing airplanes of the defendant all possess the single vertical lever movable in every direction for controlling the lateral or longitudinal equilibrium of the airplane, connected to equivalent controlling surfaces having the same functional effects as those disclosed in the patent."</p>\n<p>"Claims 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the Esnault-Pelterie patent in suit are infringed by defendant. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 303 U.

Certiorari was granted.</p>\n<p>Without its consent, the United States may not be sued for infringement of a patent.  <em>Crozier v. Fried Krupp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/290/case.html">224 U. S. 290</a></span>.  The Congress has determined the conditions upon which the United States consents to be sued.  By the applicable statute, Congress has permitted suit to be brought in the Court of Claims for reasonable compensation for the infringing use or manufacture.  Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 851, as amended by Act of July 1, 1918, 40 Stat. 705, 35 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 68.  Review by this Court of the judgment in such a suit is thus subject to the rules which have been established for the review of the judgments of the Court of Claims.  That review is limited to questions of law.</p>\n<p>The Act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, 12 Stat. 765, providing for suits against the United States in the Court of Claims, authorized appeals to this Court under such regulations as this Court should direct.  <em>See also</em> Act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, \xc2\xa7 4, 24 Stat. 505, 506, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 761.  The rules first adopted provided for the finding of the facts by the Court of Claims, and directed that</p>\n<p>"The facts so found are to be the ultimate facts or propositions which the evidence shall establish, in the nature of a special verdict, and not the evidence on which the ultimate facts are founded."</p>\n<p>Rule 1, 3 Wall. VII.  The present rule, under section 3(b) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, governing review upon certiorari, is to the same effect.  Rule 41, par. 3.  This established practice was thus described in <em>Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/533/case.html">272 U.

These references cover a number of patents claimed to be in analogous arts.  From these, the Government seeks to establish that the device in question was not patentable over prior disclosures.  But this is not a case where the Court of Claims has presented in its findings all the evidence upon which the ultimate facts are based, so that it appears on the face of the findings that the judgment is necessarily wrong as matter of law.  <em>United States v.

The opinion of the Court of Claims contains an elaborate review of the patents to which reference is made, and it discloses that there was "considerable contradictory testimony" by the various experts for the plaintiff and the defendant.  That testimony is not here, and would not appropriately form part of the record brought to this Court, as it was the duty of the court below, and is not ours, to deal with the conflicts of statement or inferences to which it might give rise.  We are not unmindful of the rule that where, with all the evidence before the court, it appears that no substantial dispute of fact is presented, and that the case may be determined by a mere comparison of structures and extrinsic evidence is not needed for purposes of explanation, or evaluation of prior art, or to resolve questions of the application of descriptions to subject matter, the questions of invention and infringement may be determined as questions of law.  <em>Heald v.

We should not be justified in taking up the patents set forth in the findings and, in the absence of the explanatory and construing testimony of the expert witnesses with respect to the pertinent fact situations, in attempting to pass upon the various questions, whether of a scientific nature or otherwise, that are involved, and upon such a necessarily limited consideration, in overruling the conclusions of fact reached by the Court of Claims upon the entire record.  <em>Compare  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/76/812/case.html">76 U.
