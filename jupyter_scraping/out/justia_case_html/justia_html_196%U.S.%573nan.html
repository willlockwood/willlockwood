The railway company answered separately, denying the allegations of the complaint.  The other defendants also denied the allegations of the complaint.  Further answering, they admitted the cutting of the lumber, but alleged it was cut from land which, when surveyed, would be section 5 of said township, and that said section was within the limits of the grant made by Congress to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and that the lumber company was, at the time of the cutting, the owner of the lands by conveyances from the railway company.</p>\n<p>The case was tried to a jury.

The court ruled out the testimony.  From the judgment entered upon the verdict for the defendants, the case was taken by writ of error to the circuit court of appeals.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 196 U. S. 576</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In the view the take of the case, the answer to the second question becomes unnecessary.  The answer to the first and third depends upon the effect of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of July 2, 1864. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="577">Page 196 U. S. 577</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The third section of that act contains the usual granting words:  "That there be, and hereby is, granted to the <em>Northern Pacific Railroad Company,\' its successors and assigns," every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, on each side of the line of the railroad when definitely fixed.\n</em></p>\n<p>It has been decided many times that such grants are <em>in praesenti,</em> and take effect upon the sections of the land when the road is definitely located, by relation as to the date of the grant.  But the survey of the land is reserved to the government (section 6); in other words, the identification of the sections -- whether odd or even -- is reserved to the government, and by the Act of July 15, 1870, making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the government for the year ending June 30, 1871, it was provided, in regard to the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, that the cost of surveying must be paid by the company, and no conveyance should be made of the lands until such cost be paid.  On account of that provision, it was held in <em>Northern Pacific Railroad Company v. Traill County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/600/case.html">115 U. S. 600</a></span>, that the land of a railroad company was not subject to taxation.  It was said, "to secure the payment of those expenses, it [the government] decided to retain the legal title in its own hands until they were paid."  <em>See also New Orleans Pacific Railway Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/124/124/case.html">124 U. S. 124</a></span>.  The equitable title becomes a legal title only upon the identification of the granted sections.  <em>Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/241/case.html">142 U. S. 241</a></span>.  As expressed in <em>Leavenworth &amp;c. Railroad Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/733/case.html">92 U. S. 733</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/733/case.html#741">92 U. S. 741</a></span>, "they" (the words "there be and is hereby granted")</p>\n<p>"vest a present title, . . . though a survey of the lands and a location of the road are necessary to give precision to it, and attach it to any particular tract."</p>\n<p>The right of survey is in the United States.  It was error, therefore, in the trial court to admit the survey made by Ashley.  It was also error to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendants.  Until the identification of the even and odd-numbered sections, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 196 U. S. 578</a></p><p> United States retained a special property, at least, in the timber growing in the township, and this was sufficient to enable it to recover the value of the timber cut and removed by the defendants.  A contrary conclusion would impair the government\'s right of survey, and force it into controversies over surveys made by the railroad or its grantees.  It would enable the railroad company or its grantees to despoil the lands of their timber and leave them denuded and maybe worthless to the government.  Indeed, it would reverse the statutory grant of powers, and transfer the location of the sections from the government to the railroad company.  The extent and the effect of the power of the government to make its own surveys is expressed and illustrated in the following cases.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/650/case.html">Maguire v. Tyler,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 650; <em>Cragin v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/128/691/case.html">128 U. S. 691</a></span>; <em>United States v.
