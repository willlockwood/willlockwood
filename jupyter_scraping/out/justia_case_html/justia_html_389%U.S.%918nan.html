Under c. 61-7, Laws 1961; Fla.Stat. 847.011(1)(a), F.S.A., it is a misdemeanor to have in one\'s \'possession, custody, or control with intent to sell ... any obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, [or] immoral ... figure [or] image.\' </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> The Florida Supreme Court may review by certiorari a decision of a district court of appeal \'in direct conflict with a decision of another district court of appeal or of the supreme court on the same point of law.\' Fla.Const., Art. V, 4(2), F.S.A.; Fla.App.R. 4.5, subd. c(6), 32 F.S.A. </p><p> Although the State suggests that the petitioner might have invoked this \'conflict jurisdiction\' in order to obtain review of his conviction in the Florida Supreme Court, the petitioner states that no Florida decision of which he is aware conflicts with that of the District Court of Appeal, and the State\'s response to the petition for certiorari refers to no decision that even purports to pass upon the issues here involved. Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that the judgment of the District Court of Appeal in this case was \'rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,\' as required by 28 U.S.C. 1257. </p><p> ______-- </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> Chapter 61-7, Laws 1961; Fla.Stat. 847.011(10).</p><ul>\'For the purpose of this section, the test of whether or not material is obscene is: Whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\' </ul> <p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> The \'prurient interest\' language of the Florida statute may be traced to a sentence in this Court\'s opinion in Roth v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#489">354 U.S. 476, 489</a>. That language, however, cannot be taken to establish a constitutionally sufficient \'test\' of obscenity. The prevailing opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan in A Book Named \'John Cleland\'s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\' v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/413/case.html">383 U.S. 413</a>, recognized that a State may not supress matter as \'obscene\' unless \'(a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value,\' stressing that the \'three elements must coalesce.\' 383 U.S., at 418. Mr. Justice White dissented in that case, nonetheless expressing the opinion that a legislature is not free to ban works of art or literature \'simply because they deal with sex or because they appeal to the prurient interest.\' Id., at 462.
