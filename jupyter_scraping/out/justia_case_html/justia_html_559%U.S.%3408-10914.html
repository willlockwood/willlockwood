S. 1</a>, 4 (1992), this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment [even] when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this case, the District Court dismissed a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s excessive force claim based entirely on its determination that his injuries were \xe2\x80\x9c<em>de minimis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, affirmed on appeal, is at odds with <em>Hudson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s direction to decide excessive force claims based on the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2008, petitioner Jamey Wilkins, a North Carolina state prisoner, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina pursuant to 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 <em>pro se</em> complaint alleged that, on June 13, 2007, he was \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously and sadistically\xe2\x80\x9d assaulted \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout any provocation\xe2\x80\x9d by a corrections officer, respondent Gaddy.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. to Pet. for Cert. C\xe2\x80\x934.  According to the complaint, Gaddy, apparently angered by Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 request for a grievance form, \xe2\x80\x9csnatched [Wilkins] off the ground and slammed him onto the concrete floor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Gaddy \xe2\x80\x9cthen proceeded to punch, kick, knee and choke [Wilkins] until another officer had to physically remove him from [Wilkins].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Wilkins further alleged that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a result of the excessive force used by [Gaddy], [he] sustained multiple physical injuries including a bruised heel, lower back pain, increased blood pressure, as well as migraine headaches and dizziness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological trauma and mental anguish including depression, panic attacks and nightmares of the assault.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, on its own motion and without a response from Gaddy, dismissed Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint for failure to state a claim.  Citing Circuit precedent, the court stated that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n order to state an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must establish that he received more than a <em>de minimus</em> <em>[sic]</em> injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 3:08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), pp.\xc2\xa01, 2 (citing <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>McDuffie</em>, 155 F. 3d 479, 483 (CA4 1998); <em>Riley</em> v. <em>Dorton</em>, 115 F. 3d 1159, 1166 (CA4 1997) (en banc); footnote omitted).  According to the court, Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injuries were no more severe than those deemed <em>de minimis</em> in the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Riley</em> decisions.  Indeed, the court noted, Wilkins nowhere asserted that his injuries had required medical attention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a motion for reconsideration, Wilkins stated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment might prejudice his claim.  He asserted that he had been prescribed, and continued to take, medication for his headaches and back pain, as well as for depression.  And he attached medical records purporting to corroborate his injuries and course of treatment.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Describing reconsideration as \xe2\x80\x9can extraordinary remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d the court declined to revisit its previous ruling.  No. 3:08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300138 (WD NC, Aug. 25, 2008), p.\xc2\xa01.  The medical records, the court observed, indicated that some of Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injuries \xe2\x80\x9cwere pre-existing conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 3.  Wilkins had sought treatment for high blood pressure and mental health issues even before the assault.  The court acknowledged that Wilkins received an X ray after the incident \xe2\x80\x9cto examine his \xe2\x80\x98bruised heel,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d but it \xe2\x80\x9cnote[d] that bruising is generally considered a <em>de minimus</em> <em>[sic]</em> injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4.  The court similarly characterized as <em>de minimis</em> Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 complaints of back pain and headaches.  The court denied Wilkins leave to amend his complaint.  In a summary disposition, the Court of Appeals affirmed \xe2\x80\x9cfor the reasons stated by the district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 08\xe2\x80\x937881 (CA4, Jan. 23, 2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In requiring what amounts to a showing of significant injury in order to state an excessive force claim, the Fourth Circuit has strayed from the clear holding of this Court in <em>Hudson</em>.  Like Wilkins, the prisoner in <em>Hudson</em> filed suit under \xc2\xa71983 alleging that corrections officers had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Evidence indicated that the officers had punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach without justification, resulting in \xe2\x80\x9cminor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip\xe2\x80\x9d as well as loosened teeth and a cracked partial dental plate.  503 U. S., at 4.  A Magistrate Judge entered judgment in Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s favor, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that an inmate must prove \xe2\x80\x9ca significant injury\xe2\x80\x9d in order to state an excessive force claim.  <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>McMillian</em>, 929 F.\xc2\xa02d 1014, 1015 (1990) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  According to the Court of Appeals, Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s injuries, which had not required medical attention, were too \xe2\x80\x9cminor\xe2\x80\x9d to warrant relief.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reversing the Court of Appeals, this Court rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9csignificant injury\xe2\x80\x9d is a threshold requirement for stating an excessive force claim.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccore judicial inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, was not whether a certain quantum of injury was sustained, but rather \xe2\x80\x9cwhether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 7; see also <em>Whitley</em> v. <em>Albers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/312/index.html">475 U. S. 312</a>, 319\xe2\x80\x93321 (1986).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9ccontemporary standards of decency always are violated \xe2\x80\xa6 whether or not significant injury is evident.  Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hudson</em>, 503 U. S., at 9; see also <em>id</em>., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when coupled with \xe2\x80\x98significant injury,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>e.g.</em>, injury that requires medical attention or leaves permanent marks\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that the \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of serious injury\xe2\x80\x9d is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry.  <em>Id</em>., at 7.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest \xe2\x80\x98whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary\xe2\x80\x99 in a particular situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Whitley</em>, 475 U. S., at 321).  The extent of injury may also provide some indication of the amount of force applied.  As we stated in <em>Hudson</em>, not \xe2\x80\x9cevery malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x98cruel and unusual\xe2\x80\x99 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <em>de minimis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (some internal quotation marks omitted).  An inmate who complains of a \xe2\x80\x9cpush or shove\xe2\x80\x9d that causes no discernible injury almost certainly fails to state a valid excessive force claim.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Glick</em>, 481 F.\xc2\xa02d 1028, 1033 (CA2 1973)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Injury and force, however, are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter that ultimately counts.  An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury.  Accordingly, the Court concluded in <em>Hudson</em> that the supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cminor\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the injuries \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[d] no basis for dismissal of [Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s] \xc2\xa71983 claim\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are not <em>de minimis</em> for Eighth Amendment purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The allegations made by Wilkins in this case are quite similar to the facts in <em>Hudson</em>, and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis closely resembles the approach <em>Hudson</em> disavowed.  Wilkins alleged that he was punched, kicked, kneed, choked, and body slammed \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously and sadistically\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout any provocation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dismissing Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 action <em>sU. S.onte</em>,<em> </em>the District Court did not hold that this purported assault, which allegedly left Wilkins with a bruised heel, back pain, and other injuries requiring medical treatment, involved <em>de minimis </em>force.  Instead, the court concluded that Wilkins had failed to state a claim because \xe2\x80\x9che simply has not alleged that he suffered anything more than de minimus <em>[sic]</em> injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 3:08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300138 (WD NC, Apr. 16, 2008), at\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In giving decisive weight to the purportedly <em>de minimis </em>nature of Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 injuries, the District Court relied on two Fourth Circuit cases.  See <em>Riley</em>, 115 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1166\xe2\x80\x931168; <em>Taylor</em>, 155 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 483\xe2\x80\x93485.  Those cases, in turn, were based upon the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s earlier decision in <em>Norman</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa03d 1259 (1994) (en banc), which approved the practice of using injury as a proxy for force.  According to the Fourth Circuit, <em>Hudson </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not foreclose and indeed is consistent with [the] view \xe2\x80\xa6 that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, a plaintiff cannot prevail on an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim if his injuries are <em>de minimis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1263.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s strained reading of <em>Hudson </em>is not defensible.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision did not, as the Fourth Circuit would have it, merely serve to lower the injury threshold for excessive force claims from \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cnon-<em>de minimis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whatever those ill-defined terms might mean.  Instead, the Court aimed to shift the \xe2\x80\x9ccore judicial inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d from the extent of the injury to the nature of the force\xe2\x80\x94specifically, whether it was nontrivial and \xe2\x80\x9cwas applied \xe2\x80\xa6 maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 7.  To conclude, as the District Court did here, that the absence of \xe2\x80\x9csome arbitrary quantity of injury\xe2\x80\x9d requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry.  <em>Id</em>., at 9.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that the District Court erred in dismissing Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint based on the supposedly <em>de minimis </em>nature of his injuries, we express no view on the underlying merits of his excessive force claim.  In order to prevail, Wilkins will ultimately have to prove not only that the assault actually occurred but also that it was carried out \xe2\x80\x9cmaliciously and sadistically\xe2\x80\x9d rather than as part of \xe2\x80\x9ca good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Moreover, even if Wilkins succeeds, the relatively modest nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may recover.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Goord</em>, 554 F.\xc2\xa03d 255, 269\xe2\x80\x93270 (CA2 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur Court has reversed summary dismissals of Eighth Amendment claims of excessive force even where the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of injury was slight \xe2\x80\xa6 . [T]he absence of any significant injury to [the plaintiff] does not end the Eighth Amendment inquiry, for our standards of decency are violated even in the absence of such injury if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s use of force was malicious or sadistic\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Mensinger</em>, 293 F.\xc2\xa03d 641, 648\xe2\x80\x93649 (CA3 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Eighth Amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied; not by the resulting injuries. \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>[D]e minimis</em> injuries do not necessarily establish <em>de minimis force</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Oliver</em> v. <em>Keller</em>, 289 F.\xc2\xa03d 623, 628 (CA9 2002) (rejecting the view \xe2\x80\x9cthat to support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than <em>de minimis</em> physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States</em> v. <em>LaVallee</em>, 439 F.\xc2\xa03d 670, 687 (CA10 2006) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\nThe Fifth Circuit has sometimes used language indicating agreement with the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gomez</em> v. <em>Chandler</em>, 163 F.\xc2\xa03d 921, 924 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o support an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim a prisoner must have suffered from the excessive force a more than <em>de minimis </em>injury\xe2\x80\x9d).  But see <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Lippard</em>, 472 F.\xc2\xa03d 384, 386 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court has never directly held that injuries must reach beyond some arbitrary threshold to satisfy an excessive force claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even in the Fifth Circuit, however, Wilkins likely would have survived dismissal for failure to state a claim because that court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have classified the sort of injuries alleged here as non-<em>de minimis</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.</em> (permitting a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Eighth Amendment excessive force claim to proceed to trial where evidence indicated that the prisoner suffered \xe2\x80\x9cone-centimeter abrasions on both his left knee and left shoulder, pain in his right knee, and tenderness around his left thumb,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cback problems\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Gomez</em>, 163 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 922 (refusing to grant summary judgment on <em>de minimis </em>injury grounds where the prisoner alleged \xe2\x80\x9cphysical pain [and] bodily injuries in the form of cuts, scrapes, [and] contusions to the face, head, and body\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963096">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n559 U.

To limit this abrupt expansion of the Clause, the Court specified that its new interpretation of the Eighth Amendment should not extend to every deprivation a prisoner suffers, but instead should apply \xe2\x80\x9c<em>only </em>[to] that narrow class of deprivations involving \xe2\x80\x98serious\xe2\x80\x99 injury inflicted by prison officials acting with a culpable state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hudson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 20 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Estelle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 106); see generally<em> Wilson</em> v. <em>Seiter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/294/index.html">501 U.

Building upon <em>Estelle\xe2\x80\x99</em>s mislaid foundation, the Court concluded that force, rather than injury, is the relevant inquiry, and that<em> </em>a prisoner who alleges excessive force at the hands of prison officials and suffers nothing more than <em>de minimis </em>injury can state a claim under the Eighth Amendment.  <em>Hudson </em>thus turned the Eighth Amendment into \xe2\x80\x9ca National Code of Prison Regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d 503 U.
