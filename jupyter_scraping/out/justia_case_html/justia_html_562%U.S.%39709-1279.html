One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C), covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(C).  CompTel, a trade association, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&amp;T had provided to the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau during an investigation of that company.  The Bureau found that Exemption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s submissions but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not have \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d interests as required by the exemption.  The FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit did not.  It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d of corporations, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d is the adjective form of the term \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d which Congress has defined, as applicable here, to include corporations, \xc2\xa7551(2).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Corporations do not have \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of Exemption 7(C).

But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerson\xe2\x80\x9d is a defined term in the statute; \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d is not.  When a statute does not define a term, the Court typically \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily refers to individuals.  People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspondence of corporations.  In fact, \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d is often used to mean precisely the <em>opposite </em>of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Dictionary definitions also suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d does not ordinarily relate to artificial \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d like corporations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T contends that its reading of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d is supported by the common legal usage of the word \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet while \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d again elides the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T provides scant support for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d denotes corporations, even in a legal context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless of whether \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d can carry a legal meaning apart from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the terms surrounding it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 9.  Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal,\xe2\x80\x9d but to the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\xe2\x80\x9d in that phrase conveys more than just \xe2\x80\x9cof a person\xe2\x80\x9d; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human concerns\xe2\x80\x94not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&amp;T.  AT&amp;T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly referred to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does it identify any other statute that does so.  While AT&amp;T argues that this Court has recognized \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d interests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d interests as a matter of constitutional or common law.  AT&amp;T contends that the FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily excludes corporations\xe2\x80\x99 privacy.  But construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe outer limits of [a word\xe2\x80\x99s] definitional possibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486, and AT&amp;T has provided no sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in Exemption 7(C) is further clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions.  Exemption 6, which Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(6).  This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as involving an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x99s right of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Department of State</em> v. <em>Ray</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/164/index.html">502 U. S. 164</a>, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94used in Exemption 6.  In contrast, FOIA Exemption 4, which protects \xe2\x80\x9ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7552(b)(4), clearly applies to corporations.

One of those exemptions covers law enforcement records, the disclosure of which \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(C).

AT&amp;T participated in an FCC-administered program\xe2\x80\x94the E-Rate (or Education-Rate) program\xe2\x80\x94that was created to enhance access for schools and libraries to advanced telecommunications and information services.  In August 2004, AT&amp;T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might have overcharged the Government for services it provided as part of the program.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s Enforcement Bureau launched an investigation.  As part of that investigation, AT&amp;T provided the Bureau various documents, including  responses to interrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing information, names and job descriptions of employees involved, and AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of whether those employees had violated the company\xe2\x80\x99s code of conduct.  582 F.\xc2\xa03d 490, 492\xe2\x80\x93493 (CA3 2009).  The FCC and AT&amp;T resolved the matter in December 2004 through a consent decree in which AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x94without conceding liability\xe2\x80\x94agreed to pay the Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure compliance with the program.  See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014, 24016\xe2\x80\x9324019.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several months later, CompTel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca trade association representing some of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s competitors\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94submitted a FOIA request seeking \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]ll pleadings and correspondence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s file on the AT&amp;T investigation.  582 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 493.  AT&amp;T opposed CompTel\xe2\x80\x99s request, and the Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bureau concluded that some of the information AT&amp;T had provided (including cost and pricing data, billing-related information, and identifying information about staff, contractors, and customer representatives) should be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, which relates to \xe2\x80\x9ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U.

Exemption 7(C) exempts \xe2\x80\x9crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(C).  The Bureau concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals identified in [AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s] submissions\xe2\x80\x9d have \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy rights\xe2\x80\x9d that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).  <em>Id.</em>, at 43a.  The Bureau did not, however, apply that exemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cbusinesses do not possess \xe2\x80\x98personal privacy\xe2\x80\x99 interests as required\xe2\x80\x9d by the exemption.  <em>Id.,</em> at 42a\xe2\x80\x9343a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau.  The Commission found AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s position that it is \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98private corporate citizen\xe2\x80\x99 with personal privacy rights that should be protected from disclosure that would \xe2\x80\x98embarrass\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\xa6 within the meaning of Exemption 7(C) \xe2\x80\xa6 at odds with established [FCC] and judicial precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  23 FCC Rcd. 13704, 13707 (2008).  It therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cExemption 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as [AT&amp;T].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 13710.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  Noting that Congress had defined the word \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d of corporations, since \xe2\x80\x9cthe root from which the statutory word [personal] \xe2\x80\xa6 is derived\xe2\x80\x9d is the defined term \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  582 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 497.  As the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival form of a defined term not to refer back to that defined term.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court accordingly ruled \xe2\x80\x9cthat FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s text unambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a \xe2\x80\x98personal privacy\xe2\x80\x99 interest within the meaning of Exemption 7(C).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 498.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent supporting petitioners.  We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&amp;T relies on the argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d in Exemption 7(C) incorporates the statutory definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondent AT&amp;T 8\xe2\x80\x939, 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (AT&amp;T Brief); 582 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 497.  The Administrative Procedure Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9can individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551(2).  Because that definition applies here, the argument goes, \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d must mean relating to those \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d: namely, corporations and other entities as well as individuals.  This reading, we are told, is dictated by a \xe2\x80\x9cbasic principle of grammar and usage.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T Brief 8; see <em>id.,</em> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315; see also 582 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 497 (citing <em>Delaware River Stevedores </em>v. <em>DiFidelto</em>, 440 F.\xc2\xa03d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., concurring), for \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca statute which defines a noun has thereby defined the adjectival form of that noun\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to AT&amp;T, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y expressly defining the noun \xe2\x80\x98person\xe2\x80\x99 to include corporations, Congress <em>necessarily</em> defined the adjective form\nof that noun\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98personal\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94also to include corporations.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T Brief 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns, but not always.  Sometimes they acquire distinct meanings of their own.  The noun \xe2\x80\x9ccrab\xe2\x80\x9d refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while the related adjective \xe2\x80\x9ccrabbed\xe2\x80\x9d can refer to handwriting that is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to read,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 527 (2002); \xe2\x80\x9ccorny\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9cusing familiar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to the unsophisticated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 509, which has little to do with \xe2\x80\x9ccorn,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 507 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe seeds of any of the cereal grasses used for food\xe2\x80\x9d); and while \xe2\x80\x9ccrank\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca part of an axis bent at right angles,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccranky\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9cgiven to fretful fussiness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 530.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even in cases such as these there may well be a link between the noun and the adjective.  \xe2\x80\x9cCranky\xe2\x80\x9d describes a person with a \xe2\x80\x9cwayward\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccapricious\xe2\x80\x9d temper, see 3 Oxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED), which might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked angular shape from which a \xe2\x80\x9ccrank\xe2\x80\x9d takes its name.  That is not the point.  What is significant is that, in ordinary usage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings as disparate as any two unrelated words.  The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d does not, in fact, derive from the English word \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead developed along its own etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, simply highlights the shortcomings of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPerson\xe2\x80\x9d is a defined term in the statute; \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d is not.  When a statute does not define a term, we typically \xe2\x80\x9cgive the phrase its ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4).  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily refers to individuals.  We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities.  This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence, influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d to describe them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation approached the chief financial officer and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have something personal to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d we would not assume the CEO was about to discuss company business.  Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s personal.\xe2\x80\x9d  A company spokesman, when asked for information about the company, would not.  In fact, we often use the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d to mean precisely the <em>opposite </em>of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dictionaries also suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d does not ordinarily relate to artificial \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d such as corporations.

The company acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cin non-legal usage, where a \xe2\x80\x98person\xe2\x80\x99 is a human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word \xe2\x80\x98personal\xe2\x80\x99 is used to refer to human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T Brief 8.  But in a watered-down version of the \xe2\x80\x9cgrammatical imperative\xe2\x80\x9d argument, AT&amp;T contends that \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in common <em>legal </em>usage\xe2\x80\x94is understood to include a corporation.  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\xe2\x80\x9d in the same context therefore can and should have the same scope, especially here in light of the statutory definition.  See <em>id</em>., at 8\xe2\x80\x939, 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The construction of statutory language often turns on context, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 5), which certainly may include the definitions of related words.  But here the context to which AT&amp;T points does not dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have no doubt that \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities.  The Dictionary Act makes that clear.  1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals\xe2\x80\x9d).  But AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d again elides the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When it comes to the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal,\xe2\x80\x9d there is little support for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in the legal context.  AT&amp;T notes that corporations are \xe2\x80\x9cprotected by the doctrine of \xe2\x80\x98personal\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d AT&amp;T Brief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction <em>in personam</em>, as opposed to <em>in rem</em>, not the jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cof a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only other example AT&amp;T cites is an 1896 case that referred to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98personal privilege\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a corporation.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Mercantile Bank</em> v. <em>Tennessee ex rel.

These examples fall far short of establishing that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary one, even if \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d does.

AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s effort to attribute a special legal meaning to the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d in this particular context is wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument treats the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d as simply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.  Under that view, the defined meaning of the noun \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on greater significance.  But two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation.  We understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resembling gold.  A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who\nis charming, lucky, and talented.  A golden opportunity is one not to be missed.  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d conveys more than just \xe2\x80\x9cof a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  It suggests a type of privacy evocative of human concerns\xe2\x80\x94not the sort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&amp;T.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite its contention that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommon legal usage\xe2\x80\x9d of the word \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d supports its reading of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d AT&amp;T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&amp;T does not cite a single instance in which this Court or any other (aside from the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does it identify any other statute that does so.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.  On the contrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress drafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding that the specific concept of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d at least as a matter of common law, did not apply to corporations.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7652I, Comment <em>c</em> (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cA corporation, partnership or unincorporated association has no personal right of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d); W.

See AT&amp;T Brief 20\xe2\x80\x9325.  But this case does not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d interests as a matter of constitutional or common law.  The discrete question before us is instead whether Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemption 7(C); the cases AT&amp;T cites are too far afield to be of help here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to demonstrate that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily <em>excludes</em> the privacy of corporations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (emphasis added).  But construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe outer limits of [a word\xe2\x80\x99s] definitional possibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U.

Congress enacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing FOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemption 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this context.  See <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6) (\xe2\x80\x9cstatutory interpretation turns on \xe2\x80\x98the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 341 (1997))).  Two of those other exemptions are particularly relevant here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d first appeared in the FOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight years before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C).  See 80 Stat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(6).  Exemption 6 covers \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute\na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(6).  Not only did Congress choose the same term in drafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly identical manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited to individuals has not come to us directly, we have regularly referred to that exemption as involving an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x99s right of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of State</em> v. <em>Ray</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/164/index.html">502 U. S. 164</a>, 175 (1991) (quoting<em> Department of Air Force</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/352/index.html">425 U.

S. 595</a>, 599 (1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T does not dispute that \xe2\x80\x9cidentical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Powerex Corp.</em> v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/224/index.html">551 U. S. 224</a>, 232 (2007), but contends that \xe2\x80\x9cif Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because [it] applies only to \xe2\x80\x98personnel and medical files and similar files,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not because of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T Brief 36 (quoting \xc2\xa7552(b)(6)).  Yet the significance of the pertinent phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of<em> </em>personal privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7552(b)(6)\xe2\x80\x94cannot be so readily dismissed.  Without it, Exemption 6 would categorically exempt \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel and medical files\xe2\x80\x9d as well as any \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d file.  Even if the scope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it protects, the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d phrase importantly defines the particular subset of that information Congress sought to exempt.  See <em>Washington Post Co.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 599.  And because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption 7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent in construing Exemption 7(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the other hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.  Exemption 4 pertains to \xe2\x80\x9ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(4).  This clearly applies to corporations\xe2\x80\x94it uses the defined term \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the source of the information\xe2\x80\x94and we far more readily think of corporations as having \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged or confidential\xe2\x80\x9d documents than personally private ones.  So at the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in place an exemption that plainly covered a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s commercial and financial information, and another that we have described as relating to \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  The language of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has long interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in Exemption 7(C) accordingly.  Shortly after Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted Exemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memorandum to executive departments and agencies explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in that exemption \xe2\x80\x9cpertains to the privacy interests of individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S.
