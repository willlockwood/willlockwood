Section 15(b) [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] provides that enforcement of \xc2\xa7 15(a) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 453 U. S. 158</a></p><p> in most agencies, including military departments, is the responsibility of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  The Commission is directed to "issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as [the Commission] deems necessary and appropriate" to carry out that responsibility.  Section 15(c) [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] provides:</p>\n<p>"Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this Act."</p>\n<p>88 Stat. 75.</p>\n<p>In 1978, respondent Alice Nakshian, who was then a 62-year-old civilian employee of the United States Department of t.he Navy, brought an age discrimination suit against the Navy under \xc2\xa7 15(c).  She requested a jury trial.  The defendant moved to strike the request, and the District Court denied the motion.  <em>Nakshian v. Claytor,</em> 481 F.Supp. 159 (DC).  The court stressed that the "legal or equitable relief" language used by Congress to establish a right to sue the Federal Government for age discrimination was identical to the language Congress had previously used in \xc2\xa7 7(c) of the Act [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] to authorize private ADEA suits.  That language, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 453 U. S. 159</a></p><p> the District Court said, was an important basis for this Court\'s holding in <em>Lorillard v. Pons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html">434 U. S. 575</a></span>, that \xc2\xa7 7(c) permits jury trials in private suits under the Act.  The court stated that, "if Congress had intended its consent to ADEA suits [against the Government] to be limited to non-jury trials, it could have easily said as much."  481 F.Supp. at 161.  Recognizing that, as a result of 1978 amendments to the ADEA, \xc2\xa7 7(c)(2) expressly confers a right to jury trial, whereas no such language exists in \xc2\xa7 15, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] 481 F.Supp. at 161, the court found no "explicit refusal" by Congress to grant the right to jury trial against the Government, and noted that the legislative history of the 1978 amendments spoke in general terms about a right to jury trial in ADEA suits.</p>\n<p>On interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(b), a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.  <em>Nakshian v. Claytor,</em> 202 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 628 F.2d 59.  The appellate court rejected the Secretary\'s argument that a plaintiff is entitled to trial by jury in a suit against the United States only when such a trial has been expressly authorized.  Instead, the court viewed the question as "an ordinary question of statutory interpretation," and found sufficient evidence of legislative intent to provide for trial by jury in cases such as this.  Noting that Congress had conferred jurisdiction over ADEA suits upon the federal district courts, rather than the Court of Claims, the Court of Appeals concluded that, "<em>absent a provision as to the method of trial, a grant of jurisdiction to a district court as a court of law carries with it a right of jury trial.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 63, 628 F.2d at 63 (quoting 5 J. Moore, J. Lucas, &amp; J. Wicker, Moore\'s Federal Practice \xef\xbf\xbd 38.32 [2], p. 38-236 (1979) (footnotes omitted)).  The Court of Appeals also adopted the District Court\'s view of the "legal . . . relief" language in \xc2\xa7 15(c).  Further, it was the court\'s view that the existence of the explicit statutory right to jury trial in suits against private employers does not </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 453 U. S. 160</a></em></p><p><em> negate the existence of a right to jury trial in suits against the Government, since the provision for jury trials in private suits was added only to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals on that issue and to confirm the correctness of this Court\'s decision in the <em>Lorillard</em> case.\n</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider the issue presented.  <em>Sub nom. Hildalgo v. Nakshian,</em> 449 U.S. 1009.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>It has long been settled that the Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury does not apply in actions against the Federal Government.  In <em>Galloway v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/372/case.html">319 U.

S. 388</a></span>-389, the Court observed (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<p>"The suit is one to enforce a monetary claim against the United States.  It hardly can be maintained that, under the common law in 1791, jury trial was a matter of right for persons asserting claims against the sovereign.  Whatever force the Amendment has therefore is derived because Congress, in the legislation cited, has made it applicable."</p>\n<p><em>See also Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html">370 U.

Moreover, the Court has recognized the general principle that</p>\n<p>"the United States, as sovereign, \'is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued . . . , and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court\'s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Testan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/392/case.html">424 U.

Thus, if Congress waives the Government\'s immunity from suit, as it has in the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a (1976 ed. and Supp. III), the plaintiff has a right to a trial by jury only where that right is one of "the terms of [the Government\'s] consent to be sued."  <em>Testan, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/392/case.html#399">424 U.

S. 590</a></span>-591.</p>\n<p>When Congress has waived the sovereign immunity of the United States, it has almost always conditioned that waiver upon a plaintiff\'s relinquishing any claim to a jury trial.  Jury trials, for example, have not been made available in the Court of Claims for the broad range of cases within its jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1491 -- <em>i.e.,</em> all claims against the United States</p>\n<p>"founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, . . . or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort."</p>\n<p><em>See Glidden Co., supra.</em>  And there is no jury trial right in this same range of cases when the federal district courts have concurrent jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1346 (a)(2) and 2402.  Finally, in tort actions against the United States, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346 (b), Congress has similarly provided that trials shall be to the court without a jury.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2402. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 453 U. S. 162</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The appropriate inquiry, therefore, is whether Congress clearly and unequivocally departed from its usual practice in this area, and granted a right to trial by jury when it amended the ADEA. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 15 of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a (1976 ed. and Supp. III), prohibits age discrimination in federal employment.  Section 15(c) provides the means for judicial enforcement of this guarantee:  any person aggrieved "may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes" of the Act.  Section 15 contrasts with \xc2\xa7 7(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 626(c) (1976 ed., Supp. III), which authorizes civil actions against private employers and state and local governments, and which <em>expressly</em> provides for jury trials.  Congress accordingly demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very "legislation cited," <em>Galloway, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/372/case.html#389">319 U. S. 389</a></span>.  But in \xc2\xa7 15, it failed explicitly to do so. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="163">Page 453 U. S. 163</a></p><p> <em>Fedorenko v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/case.html">449 U.

S. 561</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The respondent infers statutory intent from the language in \xc2\xa7 15(c) providing for the award of "legal or equitable relief," relying on <em>Lorillard v. Pons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html">434 U. S. 575</a></span>, for the proposition that the authorization of "legal" relief supports a statutory jury trial right.  But <em>Lorillard</em> has no application in this context.  In the first place, the word "legal" cannot be deemed to be what the <em>Lorillard</em> Court described as "a term of art" with respect to the availability of jury trials in cases where the defendant is the Federal Government.  In <em>Lorillard,</em> the authorization for the award of "legal" relief was significant largely because of the presence of a constitutional question.  The Court observed that, where legal relief is granted in litigation between private parties, the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury, and reasoned that Congress must have been aware of the significance of the word "legal" in that context.  But the Seventh Amendment has no application in actions at law against the Government, as Congress and this Court have always recognized.  Thus, no particular significance can be attributed to the word "legal" in \xc2\xa7 15(c).</p>\n<p>Moreover, another basis of the decision in <em>Lorillard</em> was that, when Congress chose to incorporate the enforcement scheme of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) into \xc2\xa7 7 of the ADEA, it adopted in ADEA the FLSA practice of making jury trials available.  434 U.S. . at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#580">434 U. S. 580</a></span>-583.  Again, that reasoning has no relevance to this case, because Congress did not incorporate the FLSA enforcement scheme into \xc2\xa7 15.  <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a(f) (1976 ed. . Supp. III).  Rather, 15(a) and (b) are patterned after \xc2\xa7 717 (a) and (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in March, 1972.  <em>See</em> Pub.L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 111-112, which extend the protection of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 453 U. S. 164</a></p><p> Title VII to federal employees.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e-16(a) and (b).  <em>See</em> 118 Cong.Rec. 24397(1972) (remarks of Sen. Bentsen, principal sponsor of \xc2\xa7 15 of ADEA).  And, of course, in contrast to the FLSA, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] there is no right to trial by jury in cases arising under Title VII.  <em>See Lorillard, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#583">434 U. S. 583</a></span>-584; <em>Great American Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Novotny,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/366/case.html">442 U.

S. 375</a></span>, and n.19.</p>\n<p>The respondent also infers a right to trial by jury from the fact that Congress conferred jurisdiction over ADEA suits upon the federal district courts, where jury trials are ordinarily available, rather than upon the Court of Claims, where they are not.  Not only is there little logical support for this inference, but the legislative history offers no support for it either. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Moreover, Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the right to a jury trial</p>\n<p>"as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as <em>given</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 453 U.

But it is helpful briefly to explore the legislative history, if only to demonstrate that it no more supports the holding of the Court of Appeals than does the statutory language itself. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 453 U. S. 166</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The respondent cannot point to a single reference in the legislative history to the subject of jury trials in cases brought against the Federal Government.  There is none.  And there is nothing to indicate that Congress did not mean what it plainly indicated when it expressly provided for jury trials in \xc2\xa7 7(c) cases but not in \xc2\xa7 15(c) cases.  In fact, the few inferences that may be drawn from the legislative history are inconsistent with the respondent\'s position.</p>\n<p>The ADEA originally applied only to actions against private employers.  Section 7 incorporated the enforcement scheme used in employee actions against private employers under the FLSA.  In <em>Lorillard,</em> the Court found that the incorporation of the FLSA scheme into \xc2\xa7 7 indicated that the FLSA right to trial by jury should also be incorporated.  The <em>Lorillard</em> holding was codified in 1978 when \xc2\xa7 7(c) was amended to provide expressly for jury trials in actions brought under that section.</p>\n<p>Congress expanded the scope of ADEA in 1974 to include state and local government and Federal Government employers.  State and local governments were added as potential defendants by a simple expansion of the term "employer" in the ADEA.  The existing substantive and procedural provisions of the Act, including \xc2\xa7 7(c), were thereby extended to cover state and local government employees.  In contrast, Congress added an entirely new section, \xc2\xa7 15, to address the problems of age discrimination in federal employment.  Here Congress deliberately prescribed a distinct statutory scheme applicable only to the federal sector, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and one based not on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 453 U. S. 167</a></p><p> the FLSA but, as already indicated, on Title VII, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] here, unlike the FLSA, there was no right to trial by jury. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, in a 1978 amendment to ADEA, Congress declined an opportunity to extend a right to trial by jury to federal employee plaintiffs.  Before the announcement of <em>Lorillard,</em> the Senate, but not the House, had included an amendment to \xc2\xa7 7(c) to provide for jury trials in a pending bill to revise ADEA.  After <em>Lorillard,</em> the Conference Committee recommended and Congress enacted the present \xc2\xa7 7(c)(2), closely resembling the jury trial amendment passed by the Senate.  But the Conference did not recommend, and Congress did not enact, any corresponding amendment of \xc2\xa7 15(c) to provide for jury trials in cases against the Federal Government.  Indeed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 453 U. S. 168</a></p><p> the conferees recommended and Congress enacted a new \xc2\xa7 15(f), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a(f) (1976 ed., Supp. III) providing that federal personnel actions covered by \xc2\xa7 15 are not subject to any other section of ADEA, with one exception not relevant here.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-950, p. 11 (1978).  <em>See also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-527, p. 11 (1977) ("Section 15 . . . is complete in itself").  Since the new subsection (f) clearly emphasized that \xc2\xa7 15 was self-contained and unaffected by other sections, including those governing procedures applicable in actions against private employers, Judge Tamm, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, was surely correct when he concluded that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n amending both sections as it did, Congress could not have overlooked the need to amend [\xc2\xa7 15(c)] to allow jury trials for government employees if it had so wished."</p>\n<p>202 U.S.App.D.C. at 69, n. 8, 628 F.2d at 69, n. 8.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>But even if the legislative history were ambiguous, that would not affect the proper resolution of this case, because the plaintiff in an action against the United States has a right to trial by jury only where Congress has affirmatively and unambiguously granted that right by statute.  Congress has most obviously not done so here.  Neither the provision for federal employer cases to be brought in district courts rather than the Court of Claims, nor the use of the word "legal" in that section, evinces a congressional intent that ADEA plaintiffs who proceed to trial against the Federal Government may do so before a jury.  Congress expressly provided for jury trials in the section of the Act applicable to private sector employers, and to state and local governmental entities.  It did not do so in the section applicable to the Federal Government as an employer, and indeed, patterned that section after provisions in another Act under which there is no right to trial by jury.  The conclusion is inescapable that Congress did not depart from its normal practice of not providing a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 453 U.

When fashioning a narrow exception to permit jury trials in tax refund cases in federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346(a)(1), in legislation that Congress recognized established a "wholly new precedent," H.R.Rep. No. 659, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1953), Congress expressed its concern that juries "might tend to be overly generous because of the virtually unlimited ability of the Government to pay the verdict."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Indeed, because of their firm opposition to breaking with precedent, the House conferees took almost a year before acceding to passage of the bill containing that exception.  Only after much debate, and after the conferees became convinced that there would be no danger of excessive verdicts as a result of jury trials in that unique context -- because recoveries would be limited to the amount of taxes illegally or erroneously collected -- was the bill passed.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 2276, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondent argues that the strong presumption against the waiver of sovereign immunity has no relevance to the question of a right to trial by jury.  But it is clear that the doctrine of sovereign immunity and its attendant presumptions must inform the Court\'s decision in this case.  The reason that the Seventh Amendment presumption in favor of jury trials does not apply in actions at law against the United States is that the United States is immune from suit, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, therefore, never existed with respect to a suit against the United States.  Since there is no generally applicable jury trial right that attaches when the United States consents to suit, the accepted principles of sovereign immunity require that a jury trial right be clearly provided in the legislation creating the cause of action.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissenters contend that this argument can only be made at the expense of overruling the <em>Lorillard</em> decision.  But, as hereafter indicated, <em>Lorillard</em> has little relevance here.  And, of course, the position taken in the dissent totally loses its force in view of the 1978 amendments to the ADEA, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/case.html#167">453 U. S. 167</a></span>-168, where Congress expressly extended a jury trial right in \xc2\xa7 7(c), but not in \xc2\xa7 15(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The decisions cited by the Court in <em>Lorillard,</em> 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#580">434 U. S. 580</a></span>, n. 7, for the proposition that there is a right to a jury trial in FLSA actions all appear to have rested on the Seventh Amendment, not the FLSA itself.  Thus, for the same reason that the Seventh Amendment does not apply in suits against the Federal Government, there would be no comparable right to trial by jury in FLSA suits against the Federal Government under 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 216(b).  Accordingly, even if Congress intended to incorporate the FLSA enforcement scheme into \xc2\xa7 15 of the ADEA, there would be no basis for inferring a right to a jury trial in ADEA cases where the employer is the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why Congress may have chosen to limit jurisdiction to the federal district courts.  They, along with state courts, already had jurisdiction of private sector ADEA cases under \xc2\xa7 7(c).  Congress may have decided to follow the same course in federal sector cases, but confined jurisdiction to federal district courts so that there would not be trials in state courts of actions against the Federal Government.  Exclusive district court jurisdiction is also consistent with the jurisdictional references in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e-5(f)(3) and 2000e-16(c).  Congress may also have believed it appropriate to have trials in federal district courts because they, unlike the Court of Claims, are accustomed to awarding equitable relief of the sort authorized by \xc2\xa7 15(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondent relies on <em>United States v. Pfitsch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/547/case.html">256 U. S. 547</a></span>.  But the language relied on in <em>Pfitsch</em> is dicta, since the parties in that case agreed to trial by the court sitting without a jury, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/547/case.html#549">256 U. S. 549</a></span>, and the jury trial issue was therefore not directly before the Court.  In any event, <em>Pfitsch</em> is plainly distinguishable.  There, Congress specifically rejected a proposal, "presented to its attention in a most precise form," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/547/case.html#552">256 U. S. 552</a></span>, to confer concurrent jurisdiction on the district courts and Court of Claims under the Tucker Act, and instead conferred a new and exclusive jurisdiction on the district courts.  Given the particular legislative history in that case, the Court found it "difficult to conceive of any rational ground" for conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the district courts except to provide for jury trials.  <em>Ibid.</em>  That, of course, is not true here.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">n</a> 12, <em>supra.</em>  Moreover, <em>Pfitsch</em> arose before Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 38(a) made it clear that there is no general right to trial to jury in civil actions in federal district courts.  The Rule establishes a mechanism for determining when there is such a right -- <em>i.e.,</em> when the Seventh Amendment applies, or if not, when a statute provides it.</p>\n<p>The respondent also relies on <em>Law v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/266/494/case.html">266 U. S. 494</a></span>.  The statement in <em>Law</em> regarding jury trials, which in fact does no more than cite <em>Pfitsch,</em> is also dictum, and of virtually no relevance in this context.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>A bill introduced by Senator Bentsen on March 9, 1972, S. 3318, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 118 Cong.Rec. 7745 (1972), represented the first attempt to prohibit age discrimination in federal employment.  This bill would have simply amended the definition of "employer" in the Act to include the Federal Government, as well as state and local governments.  The result would presumably have been to bring federal employees under the procedural provisions in \xc2\xa7 7.  But Senator Bentsen subsequently submitted a revised version of his bill in the form of an amendment to pending FLSA amendments.  <em>See</em> 118 Cong.Rec. 15894 (1972).  In contrast to Senator Bentsen\'s original bill, this amendment to the ADEA proposed the expansion of the definition of the term "employer" only with respect to state and local governments; ADEA coverage of federal employees was to be accomplished by the addition of an entirely new and separate section to the Act (presently \xc2\xa7 15).  Senator Bentsen\'s amendment was included in the FLSA bill reported by the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, S.Rep. No. 92-842, pp. 93-94 (1972), and it remained in this form when the bill was enacted into law in 1974.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Sections 15(a) and 15(b) of the ADEA, as offered by Senator Bentsen and as finally enacted, are patterned directly after \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 717 (a) and(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in March, 1972, <em>see</em> Pub.L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 111-112, which extend Title VII protections to federal employees.  Senator Bentsen acknowledged that "[t]he measures used to protect Federal employees [from age discrimination] would be substantially similar to those incorporated" in recently enacted amendments to Title VII.  118 Cong.Rec. 24397 (1972).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>In fact, during floor consideration of the 1972 amendments to Title VII, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have conferred a statutory right to trial by jury in Title VII cases.  <em>Id.</em> at 4919-4920.

The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff has a right to trial by jury in an action against the Federal Government under \xc2\xa7 15(c) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a(c).

The requirement that a waiver of immunity be unequivocally expressed, however, does not, as the Court suggests, carry with it a presumption against jury trial in cases where the United States has waived its immunity.  Indeed, we have previously declined to adopt such a presumption.  <em>See Law v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/266/494/case.html">266 U.

Second, and more significant for this case, the Court found that \xc2\xa7 7(c)\'s authorization of the courts to grant and individuals to seek "<em>legal</em> or equitable relief," 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 626(c) (emphasis added), strongly suggested that Congress intended to grant a jury trial right.  434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#583">434 U.

As a unanimous Court emphasized in <em>Lorillard:</em></p>\n<p>"The word \'legal\' is a term of art:  in cases in which legal relief is available and legal rights are determined, the Seventh Amendment provides a right to jury trial.  <em>See Curtis v.

Congress\' provision for "<em>legal</em> and equitable relief" suggests, therefore, that it intended to allow jury trials in ADEA actions against the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>This strong inference that Congress intended to legislate a jury trial right is reinforced by Congress\' decision to vest jurisdiction in the District Courts, rather than the Court of Claims, to decide ADEA suits brought against the Federal Government.  This Court has previously observed that vesting jurisdiction in the district courts rather than the Court of Claims supports an inference of a right to jury trial.  In <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The legislative history of the 1974 ADEA amendments, extending protection to federal employees, is consistent with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 453 U. S. 177</a></p><p> the conclusion that Congress intended to allow jury trials.  Congress\' failure to include federal employees under the ADEA when the Act was first passed</p>\n<p>"did not represent a conscious decision by the Congress to limit the ADEA to employment in the private sector.  It reflects the fact that, in 1967, when ADEA was enacted, most government employees were outside the scope of the FLSA and the Wage Hour and Public Contracts Divisions of the Department of Labor, which enforces the Fair Labor Standards Act, were assigned responsibility for enforcing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 9690, p. 55 (1974).  When the Act was amended in 1974, Congress intended that "Government employees . . . be subject to the <em>same protections</em> against arbitrary employment based on age as are employees in the private sector."  12 Cong.Rec. 8768 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Bentsen, principal proponent of ADEA extension to federal employees) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  To be sure, Congress did not provide for identical enforcement schemes for private sector and federal sector age discrimination complaints.  But when Congress departed from the "same protections" for federal employees, <em>ibid.,</em> that it had granted private sector employees, it did so expressly.  Not only did Congress, in \xc2\xa7 15, not expressly disallow jury trials where the Federal Government is the defendant, but Congress used the same language in \xc2\xa7 15(c) that it had used in \xc2\xa7 7(c) in authorizing suits in the district courts for legal or equitable relief against private parties.  This strongly suggests </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 453 U. S. 178</a></p><p> that it intended to make the jury trial right it approved against private employers equally applicable to ADEA suits against the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>The strong manifestation of congressional intent from both the language and the legislative history of the 1974 amendments is enhanced by the total absence of any persuasive evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  The Court argues, nonetheless, that Congress\' decision in 1978 to amend the ADEA to provide explicitly for jury trials in private employer cases brought under \xc2\xa7 7, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] without also amending \xc2\xa7 15(c), demonstrates an intention to preclude jury trials against the Government.  I am completely unpersuaded.</p>\n<p>The bill which led to codification of a jury trial right in \xc2\xa7 7(c)(2) was introduced by Senator Kennedy <em>before</em> this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="179">Page 453 U. S. 179</a></p><p> Court decided <em>Lorillard.</em>  In order to settle a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over the availability of jury trials in ADEA suits against private employers, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] Senator Kennedy proposed an amendment to the ADEA which would state <em>in haec verba</em> that jury trials are allowed.  123 Cong.Rec. 34317-34318 (1977). [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Senator Kennedy\'s amendment was adopted by the Senate without debate.  <em>Lorillard</em> was subsequently decided.  Thereafter, Congress passed the Kennedy amendment, with a modification proposed by the House at Conference extending the jury trial right beyond that proposed by Senator Kennedy and passed by the Senate to include claims for liquidated damages.  I can discern no congressional intent to preclude the right to a jury trial in ADEA actions against the Federal Government from this sequence of events.  The more plausible explanation, and the one with textual support in the relevant legislative history, H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 9950, pp. 114 (1978), is that Congress understood from the <em>Lorillard</em> opinion that conferring the power to award legal relief suggested a jury trial right, [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] and that the reason Congress proceeded with the Kennedy amendment was to make clear not only that suits for wages </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 453 U. S. 180</a></p><p> could be tried before a jury, but also that suits for liquidated damages could be tried before a jury, an issue explicitly left unresolved in <em>Lorillard,</em> 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#577">434 U. S. 577</a></span>, n. 2. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Moreover, that Congress did not add the same provision to \xc2\xa7 15 that it added to \xc2\xa7 7 is not indicative of an intent to prohibit jury trials for the additional reason that it was the conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether employees could have a jury trial against <em>private employers</em> which prompted Senator Kennedy to introduce his bill.  There had been no parallel development in the courts interpreting \xc2\xa7 15.  This legislative history, therefore, does not support the conclusion that the Court seeks to draw from it.</p>\n<p>The Court also argues that the absence of any reference in \xc2\xa7 15 to the FLSA "powers, remedies. and procedures" to which \xc2\xa7 7 refers and upon which <em>Lorillard</em> partially relied suggests that Congress did not intend to allow jury trials against the Federal Government.  But our decision in <em>Lorillard</em> rested equally on the provision in \xc2\xa7 7(c) for "legal or equitable relief" as a strong and independent indication of congressional intent to allow jury trials.  In addition, the more likely explanation for the absence of any reference in \xc2\xa7 15 to the FLSA sections referred to in \xc2\xa7 7(b) is that Congress intended to use existing administrative procedures "to enforce the provisions of [\xc2\xa7 15(a)] through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without backpay."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 633a(b) (1976 ed., Supp. III).  Prior to the 1974 amendments extending ADEA coverage to federal employees, employment discrimination complaints by federal employees were processed by the Civil Service Commission, so that it is not surprising that Congress decided to use existing administrative machinery in \xc2\xa7 15(b) to enforce ADEA provisions protecting federal employees.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 453 U.

[<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  The failure to refer to FLSA procedures in \xc2\xa7 15 apparently derives not from a desire to limit jury t.rials, but from an intention to employ different <em>administrative</em> procedures for age discrimination complaints brought against the Federal Government. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Seen in this light, the Court\'s strained interpretation of the failure to refer to FLSA procedures in \xc2\xa7 15 is totally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Based on the language of \xc2\xa7 15(c) and on the legislative history, which is consistent with my interpretation of that language, I would hold that Congress intended to allow jury trials in ADEA suits against the Federal Government. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 453 U.

Indeed, Rule 38 was fully applicable at the time of <em>Lorillard v. Pons,</em> where this Court found a jury trial right even though the words "trial by jury," did not appear in the statute.

Obviously, that argument would be frivolous, since <em>Lorillard</em> found a jury trial right in the absence of an express provision conferring the right.  Either Rule 38 does not require that the grant be express, as I suggest, or the unanimous holding of the Court in <em>Lorillard</em> was wrong.</p>\n<p>Still, the Court misapprehends the thrust of my argument when it states that Rule 38 "hardly states a general rule that jury trials are to be presumed whenever Congress provides for cases to be brought in federal district courts."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/case.html#165">453 U.

The Court recognizes, as it must, that there was no such express language in \xc2\xa7 7(c) when this Court decided in <em>Lorillard</em> that Congress intended ADEA actions against private employers to include a jury trial right, and that the express language relied on by the Court was added two months <em>after</em> <em>Lorillard</em> was decided and four years <em>after</em> the identical language which was construed in <em>Lorillard</em> was added to the ADEA in \xc2\xa7 15(c).  Therefore, unless the Court is suggesting that the unanimous holding in <em>Lorillard</em> was wrong, the Court is bound to apply the same analysis to this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Compare Rogers v.

I find this argument unpersuasive, as the Court did in <em>Lorillard.</em>  The Court has previously said that, despite important similarities between Title VII and the ADEA, "it is the remedial and procedural provisions of the two laws that are crucial, and there we find significant differences."  <em>Lorillard v. Pons,</em> 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html#584">434 U. S. 584</a></span>.</p>\n<p>"Congress specifically provided for both \'legal or equitable relief\' in the ADEA, but did not authorize \'legal\' relief in so many words under Title VII."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>This interpretation is supported by Congress\' extension of ADEA protection to employees of state and local governments, which occurred at the same time that Congress extended coverage to federal employees.  Because the definitional section of the Act was amended to include state and local governments within the definition of "employer," 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 630(b), age discrimination complaints against state and local governments can be tried to a jury for the same reason that complaints against private entities can be.  Nowhere in the legislative history did Congress evince a desire to allow state and local government employees a jury trial right, while withholding the same right from federal employees.  Rather, federal employees were covered in a separate section of the Act, apparently so that existing administrative machinery could be used.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
