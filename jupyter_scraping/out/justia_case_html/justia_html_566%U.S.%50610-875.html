They proposed a plan under which they would pay off outstanding liabilities with proceeds from the sale.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from the sale.  Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance being discharged.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.  The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398, 1399, it does not \xe2\x80\x9cincur\xe2\x80\x9d postpetition federal income taxes.

A tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate\xe2\x80\x9d is a tax for which the estate itself is liable.  Only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes.  IRC \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398 and 1399 define the division of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis.  Under those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a separately taxable entity.  The debtor\xe2\x80\x94not the trustee\xe2\x80\x94is generally liable for taxes and files the only tax return.  The postpetition income taxes are thus not \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x88\x925.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Section 346 of the Bankruptcy Code and its longstanding interplay with IRC \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398 and 1399 reinforce that whether an estate \xe2\x80\x9cincurs\xe2\x80\x9d taxes turns on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chapter-specific guidance on which estates are separately taxable.  The original \xc2\xa7346 established that state or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, and only on the debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Congress applied the framework of \xc2\xa7346 to federal taxes two years later: IRC \xc2\xa71398 and 1399 established that the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases, and not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter 12) cases.  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 subsequently amended \xc2\xa7346, expressly aligning its assignment of state or local taxes with the IRC separate taxable entity rules for federal taxes.  This Court assumes that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the existing law at the enactment of \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate\xe2\x80\x99s liability for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x88\x929.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Chapter 13, on which Chapter 12 was modeled, further bolsters this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Established understandings hold that postpetition income taxes are not \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the [Chapter 13] estate\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7503(b) because they are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone.  The Government has also long hewed to this position.  Section 1305(a)(1), which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case, would be superfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collectible inside the bankruptcy.  It is thus clear that postpetition income taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and are not administrative expenses under \xc2\xa7503(b).  To hold otherwise in Chapter 12 would disrupt settled practices in Chapter 13 cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x88\x9212.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0None of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent overcomes the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, context, and structure.  There is no textual basis for giving \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate\xe2\x80\x9d a temporal meaning, such that it refers to all taxes \xe2\x80\x9cincurred postpetition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does the text support deeming a tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate\xe2\x80\x9d whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate.  Section 503\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history is not inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.  See Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Meanwhile, any cases suggesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative expenses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors, which Congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne by a separate taxable entity\xe2\x80\x99s trustee.  Finally, petitioners contend that the purpose of \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts.  There may be compelling policy reasons for treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable.  But if Congress intended petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 result, it did not so provide in the statute.

Income from postpetition sales of farm assets is considered property of the estate.  See \xc2\xa71207(a).

To concede that someone other than the estate is liable for filing the return and paying the tax, and yet maintain that the estate is the one that has \xe2\x80\x9cincurred\xe2\x80\x9d the tax, defies the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cincur\xe2\x80\x9d as bringing a liability upon oneself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent, echoing both of these points, urges that we \xe2\x80\x9csimply .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. consider the debtor and estate as merged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 11.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe English language,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent reasons, \xe2\x80\x9cpermits this reading\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not require\xe2\x80\x9d our reading.

E.g., United States v. Noland, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535, \n543 (1996)\n (cor- porate Chapter 11 debtor); Nicholas v. United States, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678\n\xe2\x80\x93688 (1966) (corporate Chapter XI case under predecessor Bankruptcy Act).  But those cases involve corporate debtors and are therefore inapposite.  Among estates that are not separately taxable, those involving corporate debtors have long been singled out by Congress for special responsibilities.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See H.\xc2\xa0R.

Although estates of corporate debtors are not separate taxable entities under 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398 and 1399, the IRC requires a trustee that \xe2\x80\x9chas possession of or holds title to all or substantially all the property or business of a corporation\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the return of income for such corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76012(b)(3).  In effect, Congress provided that the trustee in a corporate-debtor case may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne by the trustee of a separate taxable entity.  In any event, petitioners do not deny that neither the separate taxable entity provisions nor the special provisions for corporate debtors apply to them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, petitioners and the dissent contend that the purpose of \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust relief from tax debts, relying on statements by a single Senator on unenacted bills introduced in years preceding the enactment.  See Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9336.  They argue that deeming \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A) inapplicable to their postpetition income taxes would undermine that purpose and confine the exception to prepetition taxes.  But we need not resolve here what other claims, if any, are covered by \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Whatever the 2005 Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent with respect to \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)(A), that provision merely carved out an exception to the pre-existing priority classification scheme.  The exception could only apply to claims \xe2\x80\x9centitled to priority under section 507\xe2\x80\x9d in the first place.  That pre-existing scheme was in turn premised on antecedent, decades-old understandings about the scope of \xc2\xa7503(b) and the division of tax liabilities between estates and debtors.  See Dewsnup v. Timm, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410, \n419 (1992)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress amends the bankruptcy laws, it does not write \xe2\x80\x98on a clean slate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  If Congress wished to alter these background norms, it needed to enact a provision to enable postpetition income taxes to be collected in the Chapter 12 plan in the first place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent concludes otherwise by an inverted analysis.  Rather than demonstrate that such claims were treated as \xc2\xa7507 priority claims in the first place, the dissent begins with the single Senator\xe2\x80\x99s stated purpose for the exception to that priority scheme.  Post, at 7.

Asa practical matter, it is not clear that Chapter 12 bankruptcies are substantially longer.  Compare Brief for Neil E.

In any event, there is no indication that Congress intended any difference in duration\xe2\x80\x94if it anticipated a difference at all\xe2\x80\x94to flip the characterization of postpetition income taxes from one chapter to the other.  Nor does the absence of a \xc2\xa71305 equivalent in Chapter 12 justify shoehorning postpetition taxes into \xc2\xa7503(b), as the dissent argues.  That Chapter 12 lacks a provision allowing such taxes to be brought inside the plan only clarifies that such taxes fall outside of the plan.\nThe dissent alternatively suggests that it \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not see the serious harm in treating the relevant taxes as \xe2\x80\x98administrative expenses\xe2\x80\x99 in both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.

An eligible farmer whose debts exceed his assets may enter Chapter 12 bankruptcy, at which point he must develop a detailed Plan setting forth how he will pay his debts.

Roughly speaking, the chapter requires that a holder of a secured claim receive the full amount of that claim up to the value of the collateral securing the loan.  The claim may be paid over an extended period.  If the claim exceeds the value of the collateral, the creditor is given an unsecured claim in the remainder.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7506(a), 1225(a)(5).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe holder of a \xc2\xa7507 priority claim (a category that includes, among other things, domestic support obligations, debts for taxes incurred before filing the bankruptcy petition, and administrative expenses) must receive the full amount of the priority claim in deferred cash payments paid over the life of the Plan.  \xc2\xa71222(a)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe holder of an ordinary unsecured claim\xe2\x80\x94i.e., an unsecured claim of a kind not listed in \xc2\xa7507\xe2\x80\x94may receive at least a partial payment from the amount left over after the payment of the secured and \xc2\xa7507 priority claims.  This amount may well be more than zero, for the Plan must provide that the farmer will devote all \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d (as defined by \xc2\xa71225(b)(2)) or property of equivalent value to the repayment of his debts over the next three years (sometimes extended to five years).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71222(c), 1225(b)(1).

The Code does not, however, permit all debts to be discharged.

If so, the farmer may not be able to proceed under Chapter 12.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71225(a)(1), (6) (bankruptcy court will not confirm Plan unless it satisfies statutory criteria and debtor will be able to make good on his commitments under the Plan).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also important to understand that the same kind of insufficient-assets-and-income problem might occur where the debtor owes the Government a large post-petition tax debt.  In general, postpetition claims are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings.  See 7 Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice \xc2\xa7135:14 (3d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Norton).  Unless the Government\xe2\x80\x99s debt falls within an exception to this general rule, bankruptcy law would leave the Government to collect its postpetition claim outside of bankruptcy as best it could.  Again, the result will be to leave the farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his Chapter 12 Plan\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to the point where he cannot proceed under Chapter 12 at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith this general summary in mind, it is easier to understand the significance of the question this case presents.

See ibid. (exception applies to claims \xe2\x80\x9cowed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of any farm asset\xe2\x80\x9d).  If, as petitioners claim, that is so, then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a farmer from proceeding under Chapter 12, since its treatment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the farmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if the Government and the majority are right, then the capital gains tax falls outside the category of \xc2\xa7507 priority claims\xe2\x80\x94and therefore falls outside the scope of the Amendment; in fact, it falls outside the bankruptcy proceeding altogether.  And the Government then might well be able to collect the debt in full outside the bankruptcy proceeding\xe2\x80\x94even if doing so would reduce the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s assets and future income to the point where the farmer would not be able to proceed under Chapter 12.  The question before us is whether we must interpret the Amendment in a way that could bring about this result.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress did not intend this result.  In a significant number of instances a Chapter 12 farmer, in order to have enough money to pay his creditors, might have to sell farmland or other farm assets at a price that would give rise to considerable capital gains taxes (particularly if the family has held the land or assets for many years).  If the resulting tax debt were treated as a \xc2\xa7507 priority claim, then it might well absorb much of the money raised to the point where (depending upon the size of his other debts) the farmer might be unable to proceed under Chapter 12.  The Amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax authorities farther back in the creditor queue, requiring them, like ordinary unsecured creditors, to seek payment from the funds that remain after the \xc2\xa7507 priority creditors (and secured claim holders) have been paid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s chief legislative sponsor, Senator Charles Grassley, explained this well when he told the Senate:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cUnder current law, farmers often face a crushing tax liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to reorganize their business affairs.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  [H]igh taxes have caused farmers to lose their farms.  Under the bankruptcy code, the I.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0S. must be paid in full for any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy reorganization.  If the farmer can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the I.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0S. in full, then he can\xe2\x80\x99t keep his farm.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t sound policy.  Why should the I.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0S. be allowed to veto a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s reorganization plan?  [The Amendment] takes this power away from the I.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0S. by reducing the priority of taxes during proceedings.  This will free up capital for investment in the farm, and help farmers stay in the business of farming.\xe2\x80\x9d  145 Cong.

It holds that the only income tax claims to which \xc2\xa7507 accords priority are claims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in which the farmer filed for bankruptcy.  (We shall call these \xe2\x80\x9cprepetition tax claims.\xe2\x80\x9d)  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa7507 does not cover income tax liabilities that arise during the year of filing or during the Chapter 12 proceedings.  (We shall call these \xe2\x80\x9cpostpetition tax claims.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935; see Brief for United States 8 (the Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cprovides farmers relief from [only] those tax claims that are otherwise entitled to priority under 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. 507(a)(8), namely pre-petition claims arising from the sale of farm as- sets\xe2\x80\x9d); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \xc2\xa7705(1)(A), \n\n119Stat.\n126 (amending \xc2\xa7507(a)(8) to clarify that it only covers income tax claims for taxable years that end on or before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority then observes that the Amendment creates an exception only in respect to \xc2\xa7507 priority claims.  \xc2\xa71222(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe plan shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provide for the full payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)).  Ante, at 2.  Thus, if (without the Amendment) \xc2\xa7507 would not cover postpetition capital gains taxes in the first place, the Amendment (creating only a \xc2\xa7507 exception) cannot affect postpeti- tion tax claims.  An exception from nothing amounts to nothing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsequently, the majority concludes that postpetition tax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely; the tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordinary tax debts; and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to collect them can lead to the very results (blocking the use of Chapter 12) that the Amendment sought to avoid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTherein lies the problem.  These results are the very opposite of what Congress intended.  Congress did not want to relegate to ordinary-unsecured-claim status only prepetition tax claims, i.e., tax claims that accrued well before the Chapter 12 proceedings began.  Rather, Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves.  See 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (the Amendment will have the effect of \xe2\x80\x9creducing the priority of taxes during proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) (statement of Sen.

The majority does not deny the importance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective.  Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnlike the majority, I believe the relevant Bankruptcy Code language can be and is better interpreted in a way that would give full effect to the Amendment.  In particular, the relevant language is better interpreted so that in the absence of the Amendment \xc2\xa7507 would cover these postpetition tax claims.  Hence the Amendment creates an exception from what otherwise would amount to a \xc2\xa7507 priority claim.  And it can take effect as written.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is common ground that subsection (a)(2) of \xc2\xa7507 cov- ers, and gives \xc2\xa7507 priority to, \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative expenses allowed under section 503(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7507(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).

It emphasizes that tax law does not treat a Chapter 12 bankruptcy estate as a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate taxable entity,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., as separate from the farmer-debtor for federal income tax purposes.  26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398, 1399.  This means that there is just one entity\xe2\x80\x94the debtor\xe2\x80\x94for these purposes.  And \xc2\xa7346 of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that any state and local income tax liabilities incurred by a Chapter 12 estate must also be taxed to the debtor.  The majority says that these provisions mean that only the debtor, and not the estate, can \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98incu[r]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d taxes within the meaning of \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7503(b)(1)(B)(i).

That is to say, the phrase tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the [bankruptcy] estate\xe2\x80\x9d can include a tax incurred by the farmer while managing his estate in the midst of his bankruptcy proceedings, i.e., between the time the farmer files for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy court confirms the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s Chapter 12 Plan.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe bankruptcy estate is in existence during this time.  Cf. \xc2\xa71227(b) (property of the estate vests in the debtor at confirmation unless the Plan provides otherwise).  The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s assets during this time.

And, as a matter of both the English language and bankruptcy principles, one can consider a tax liability that the farmer incurs during this period (such as a capital gains tax arising from a sale of a portion of his farm assets to raise funds for creditors) as a liability that, in a bankruptcy sense, the estate incurs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe English language permits this reading of the phrase tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the farmer, in the midst of Chapter 12 proceedings, sells a portion of his farm to raise money to help pay his creditors, one can say, as a matter of English, that the bankruptcy estate has \xe2\x80\x9cincurred\xe2\x80\x9d the associated tax, even if it is ultimately taxed to the farmer, just as one can say that an employee who makes purchases using a company credit card \xe2\x80\x9cincurs costs\xe2\x80\x9d for which his employer is liable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a matter of general bankruptcy principles (as Congress understood them), the history of the 1978 Bank- ruptcy Code revision is replete with statements to the effect that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

In fact, the very tax provisions that separate the estate from the individual debtor in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 proceedings, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71398 and 1399, say that the Chapter 12 estate is not separate from the debtor for tax purposes\xe2\x80\x94a concept consistent, not at odds, with merging the two for this bankruptcy purpose.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading free of conceptual problems.  If we read the phrase tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate\xe2\x80\x9d as excluding tax liabilities incurred while the farmer is in Chapter 12 bankruptcy, we must read it as excluding not only capital gains taxes but also other kinds of taxes, such as an employer\xe2\x80\x99s share of Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, or other employee taxes.

Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  Chapter 13, it points out, allows individuals (typically those who are not farmers or fishermen) to reorganize their debts in much the same way as does Chapter 12.  And there is authority holding that taxes on income earned between the time the Chapter 13 debtor files for bankruptcy and the time the bankruptcy Plan is confirmed are not \xe2\x80\x9ctax[es] incurred by the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  See In\xc2\xa0re Whall, 391 B.\xc2\xa0R. 1, 5\xe2\x80\x936 (Bkrtcy.

Compare H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93595, at 276 (\xe2\x80\x9cmost chapter 13 estates will only remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d), with Brief for Neil E.

That chapter, unlike Chapter 12, contains a special provision that permits the Government to seek \xc2\xa7507 priority treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending.  \xc2\xa71305 (Government can file proof of claim to have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen before the petition was filed).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, if uniformity of interpretation between these two chapters is critical, I do not see the serious harm in treating the relevant taxes as \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative expenses\xe2\x80\x9d in both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases rather than in neither.  The majority apparently believes that this would render \xc2\xa71305 (the provision permitting the Government to seek \xc2\xa7507 priority treatment) superfluous.  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  But that is not so.  This interpretation would simply limit the scope of operation of \xc2\xa71305 to the period of time after the Chapter 13 Plan is confirmed but while the Chapter 13 case is still pending.  And that is likely to be a significant period of time relative to the preconfirmation period.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93595, at 276 (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ost chapter 13 estates will only remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71325(b)(1), (4) (debtor must commit all his projected disposable income over a 3-year period (sometimes extended to five) to the Plan, unless all unsecured claims can be paid off over a shorter period).  The greatest Chapter 13 harm this interpretation could cause is to re- quire the Government to pursue those tax liabilities as \xc2\xa7507 priority administrative expense claims (rather than allow it to choose between \xc2\xa7507 priority treatment and pursuing those claims outside bankruptcy) during the relatively brief period of time between the filing of a petition and the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, I would treat a postpetition/preconfirmation tax liability as a tax \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by the estate,\xe2\x80\x9d hence as an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative expense,\xe2\x80\x9d hence as a \xe2\x80\x9cclai[m] entitled to priority under section 507, unless .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d hence as a claim falling within the scope of the Amendment.

It says that neither the Amendment nor anything else in \xc2\xa71222(a) provides for the payment of administrative expenses.  Rather, that section and its Amendment provide only for the payment of \xe2\x80\x9cclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71222(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe plan shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provide for the full payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).

This is because the Code defines \xe2\x80\x9ccreditor\xe2\x80\x9d to include only hold- ers of pre-petition claims, thus excluding holders of post-petition claims, such as administrative expenses.  \xc2\xa7101(10).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government points out that a different Code section, namely \xc2\xa71226(b)(1), provides for the payment of administrative expenses.  That section says that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]efore or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan, there shall be paid .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any unpaid claim of the kind specified in section 507(a)(2),\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative ex- penses.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Congress did not amend \xc2\xa71226(b)(1); it amended the earlier section, \xc2\xa71222(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, the Government says, the Plan only covers those \xc2\xa7507 priority \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses and claims\xe2\x80\x9d that are described as \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d and can be held by \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1226(b)(1), not \xc2\xa71222, deals with administrative expenses.

For the Code also uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d to cover both prepetition and postpetition claims (such as administrative expenses).  E.g., \xc2\xa7101(5)(A) (defining a claim as a \xe2\x80\x9cright to payment\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7726(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (refer- ring to \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d that include administrative expenses).

(Emphasis added.)  And one can easily read that section as setting forth when, not whether, administrative expenses will be paid under the Plan (i.e., as specifying that the Plan must provide for the payment of administrative expenses before payments to other creditors are made).  Thus, reading \xc2\xa71222(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d as including administrative expenses need not render \xc2\xa71226(b)(1) surplusage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat about \xc2\xa71227(a), which refers only to \xe2\x80\x9ccreditor[s]\xe2\x80\x9d?

Thus, by here referring to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative expenses\xe2\x80\x9d (through its reference to \xc2\xa7503), Chapter 12 makes clear that at least some postpetition claims are to be discharged once the debtor has completed his payments under the Plan.
