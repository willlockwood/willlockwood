S. 107</a></p><p></p>\n<p>STORY, JUSTICE, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The shipment in this case was made by Moreira, Vieira &amp; Machado, a house of trade established in London, on the account of the house, to Moreira, one of the partners in the house, who was a native of, and domiciled in, Lisbon in the kingdom of Portugal, and the only question is whether the share of Moreira in the shipment is exempted from condemnation by reason of his neutral domicile?  It has been long since decided in the courts of admiralty that the property of a house of trade established in the enemy\'s country is condemnable as prize, whatever may be the domicile of the partners.  The trade of such a house is deemed essentially a hostile trade, and the property engaged in it is therefore treated as enemy\'s property notwithstanding the neutral domicile of any of the company.  The rule, then, being inflexibly settled, we do not now feel at liberty to depart from it, whatever doubt might have been entertained, if the case were entirely new.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
