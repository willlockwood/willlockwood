S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640, authorized statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans as follows:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) [A]ny creditor who fails in connection with any consumer credit transaction to disclose to any person any information required \xe2\x80\xa6 is liable to that person in an amount \xe2\x80\xa6 of \xe2\x80\xa6 (1) twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1974, Congress added a new paragraph (1) to \xc2\xa71640(a) to allow for the recovery of actual damages and to provide separate statutory damages for class actions.  Congress simultaneously amended the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved that provision from \xc2\xa71640(a)(1) to \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries.  Congress accounted for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s restructuring by changing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this paragraph\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph.\xe2\x80\x9d  A 1976 amendment redesignated \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory damages provision as \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(i), inserted a new clause (ii) setting statutory damages for individual actions relating to consumer leases, and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  Following the latter amendment, the lower federal courts consistently held that the $100/$1,000 brackets remained applicable to all consumer financing transactions, whether lease or loan.  Finally, in 1995, Congress added a new clause (iii) at the end of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), so that the statute now authorizes statutory damages equal to \xe2\x80\x9c(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease \xe2\x80\xa6 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or (iii) in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Nigh attempted to purchase a used truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Unable to find a lender to complete the financing, Koons Buick twice revised the retail installment sales contract presented to Nigh.  After signing the third contract, Nigh discovered that the second contract had contained an improperly documented charge for a car alarm that Nigh never requested, agreed to accept, or received.  Nigh made no payments on the truck and returned it to Koons Buick.  He then filed suit against Koons Buick alleging, among other things, a TILA violation and seeking uncapped recovery of twice the finance charge, $24,192.80, under clause (i) of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A).  The District Court held that damages were not capped at $1,000, and the jury awarded Nigh the full uncapped amount.  In affirming, the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured closed-end loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  The Court of Appeals held that its previous view that the $1,000 cap applied to both clauses (i) and (ii) of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) was rendered defunct when Congress struck the \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d preceding clause (ii) and inserted clause (iii) after the \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d phrase.  According to the court, the inclusion of the new $200/$2,000 brackets in clause (iii) shows that the clause (ii) $100/$1,000 brackets can no longer be interpreted to apply to all of subparagraph (A), but must now apply solely to clause (ii), so as not to render meaningless the new minimum and maximum recoveries articulated in clause (iii).  The court therefore allowed Nigh to recover the full uncapped amount of $24,192.80.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  Both the conventional meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d and standard interpretive guides point to the same conclusion:\xc2\xa0The $1,000 cap applies to recoveries under clause (i).  Congress ordinarily adheres to a hierarchical scheme in subdividing statutory sections.  Under that scheme, the word \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d is used to refer to a subdivision preceded by a capital letter and the word \xe2\x80\x9cclause\xe2\x80\x9d to a subdivision preceded by a lower case Roman numeral.  Congress followed this scheme in drafting TILA.  For example, \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions, states: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he total recovery <em>under this subparagraph</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Had Congress meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have stated in clause (ii): \xe2\x80\x9cliability under this clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statutory history resolves any ambiguity whether the $100/$1,000 brackets apply to recoveries under clause (i).  Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for the entire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transactions.  Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  The addition of clause (iii) makes closed-end mortgages subject to a higher floor and ceiling, but clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.  Clause (i)\xe2\x80\x99s specification of statutory damages of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.  Clause (iii) removes closed-end mortgages from clause (i)\xe2\x80\x99s governance only to the extent that clause (iii) prescribes higher brackets.  There is scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) when it added clause (iii).  Cf. <em>Church of Scientology of Cal.</em> v. <em>IRS,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/9/index.html">484 U. S. 9</a>, 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The history demonstrates that, by adding clause (iii), Congress sought to provide <em>increased recovery</em> when a TILA violation occurs in the context of a loan secured by real property.  It would be passing strange to read the statute to cap recovery in connection with a closed-end, real-property-secured loan at an amount <em>substantially lower</em> than the recovery available when a violation occurs in the context of a personal-property-secured loan or an open-end, real-property-secured loan.  The text does not dictate this result; the statutory history suggests otherwise; and there is scant indication Congress meant to change the well-established meaning of clause (i).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71601 <em>et seq.</em>, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans \xe2\x80\x9csecured by real property or a dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/\n$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted TILA in 1968, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Pub. L. 90\xe2\x80\x93321, 82 Stat. 146, as amended, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71601 <em>et seq.</em>, to \xe2\x80\x9cassure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7102, codified in 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71601(a).  The Act requires a creditor to disclose information relating to such things as finance charges, annual percentage rates of interest, and borrowers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71631\xe2\x80\x931632, 1635, 1637\xe2\x80\x931639, and it prescribes civil liability for any creditor who fails to do so, see \xc2\xa71640.  As originally enacted in 1968, the Act provided for statutory damages of twice the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that recovery could not be less than $100 or greater than $1,000.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The original civil-liability provision stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) [A]ny creditor who fails in connection with any consumer credit transaction to disclose to any person any information required under this chapter to be disclosed to that person is liable to that person in an amount \xe2\x80\xa6 of</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1) twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pub.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a), to allow for the recovery of actual damages in addition to statutory damages and to provide separate statutory damages for class actions.  Pub. L. 93\xe2\x80\x93495, \xc2\xa7408(a), 88 Stat. 1518.  Congress reworded the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved the provision from \xc2\xa71640(a)(1) to \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  In order to account for the restructuring of the statute, Congress changed the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this paragraph\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph.\xe2\x80\x9d  The amended statute provided for damages in individual actions as follows: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) [A]ny creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter \xe2\x80\xa6 is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1) any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of the failure;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(2)(A) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7408(a), 88 Stat. 1518.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A further TILA amendment in 1976 applied truth-in-lending protections to consumer leases.  Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 257.  Congress inserted a clause into \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) setting statutory damages for individual actions relating to consumer leases at 25% of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease.  Again, Congress retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on statutory damages.  The amended \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) provided for statutory damages equal to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, or (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease \xe2\x80\xa6 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pub. L. 94\xe2\x80\x93240, \xc2\xa74(2), 90 Stat. 260, codified in 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a) (1976 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFollowing the insertion of the consumer lease provision, courts consistently held that the $100/$1,000 limitation remained applicable to all consumer financing transactions, whether lease or loan.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Purtle</em> v. <em>Eldridge Auto Sales, Inc.</em>, 91 F.\xc2\xa03d 797, 800 (CA6 1996);<em> Cowen </em>v. <em>Bank United of Tex., FSB</em>, 70 F.\xc2\xa03d 937, 941 (CA7 1995);<em> Mars </em>v. <em>Spartanburg Chrysler Plymouth, Inc.</em>, 713 F.\xc2\xa02d 65, 67 (CA4 1983); <em>Dryden </em>v. <em>Lou Budke\xe2\x80\x99s Arrow Finance Co.</em>, 661 F.\xc2\xa02d 1186, 1191, n.\xc2\xa07 (CA8 1981); <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Public Finance Corp.</em>, 598 F.\xc2\xa02d 349, 358, 359, n.\xc2\xa017 (CA5 1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995, Congress amended TILA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory damages provision once more.  The 1995 amendment, which gave rise to the dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the end of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling for statutory damages in an individual action relating to a closed-end credit transaction \xe2\x80\x9csecured by real property or a dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub. L. 104\xe2\x80\x9329, \xc2\xa76, 109 Stat. 274.  These closed-end real estate loans, formerly encompassed by clause (i), had earlier been held subject to the $100/$1,000 limitation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>Vanguard Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em>, 710 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 143, 146 (ED Pa. 1989) (ordering \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum statutory award of $1,000\xe2\x80\x9d for each TILA violation concerning a secured real estate loan).  Section 1640(a), as amended in 1995, thus provides for statutory damages equal to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease \xe2\x80\xa6 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or (iii) in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after the passage of the 1995 TILA amendments, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an official policy announcement describing the changes.  With respect to changes in TILA\xe2\x80\x99s civil-liability provisions, the announcement stated only that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]unitive damages have been increased for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling from a maximum of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,000 (<em>closed-end credit only</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  Administrator of National Banks, Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, OCC Bulletin 96\xe2\x80\x931, p.\xc2\xa02 (Jan. 5, 1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, the Seventh Circuit, in <em>Strange</em> v. <em>Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga.</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, held that the meaning of clauses (i) and (ii) remained untouched by the addition of clause (iii).  The Seventh Circuit observed that prior to the addition of clause (iii) in 1995, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ourts uniformly interpreted the final clause, which established the $100 minimum and the $1,000 maximum, as applying to both (A)(i) and (A)(ii).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 947.  The 1995 amendment, the Seventh Circuit reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cwas designed simply to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for certain secured transactions, without changing the general rule on minimum and maximum damage awards for the other two parts of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As <em>Strange</em> illustrates, TILA violations may involve finance charges that, when doubled, are less than $100.  There, double-the-finance-charge liability was $54.27, entitling the plaintiff to the $100 minimum.  <em>Id.,</em> at 945, 947.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 4, 2000, respondent Bradley Nigh attempted to purchase a used 1997 Chevrolet Blazer truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.

Koons Buick could not find a lender to purchase an assignment of the payments owed under the sales contract and consequently restructured the deal to require a larger downpayment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 122.  On February 25, after Koons Buick falsely told Nigh that his trade-in vehicle had been sold, Nigh signed a new retail installment sales contract.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once again, however, Koons Buick was unable to find a willing lender.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nigh ultimately signed, under protest, a third retail installment sales contract.  <em>Ibid. </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nigh later discovered one reason why Koons Buick had been unable to find an assignee for the installment payments due under the second contract: That contract contained an improperly documented charge of $965 for a Silencer car alarm Nigh never requested, agreed to accept, or received.

But the majority held that \xe2\x80\x9cby striking the \xe2\x80\x98or\xe2\x80\x99 preceding (ii), and inserting (iii) after the \xe2\x80\x98under this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x99 phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress had \xe2\x80\x9crendered <em>Mars</em>\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation defunct.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 126.  According to the majority: \xe2\x80\x9cThe inclusion of the new maximum and minimum in (iii) shows that the clause previously interpreted to apply to all of (A), can no longer apply to (A), but must now apply solely to (ii), so as not to render meaningless the maximum and minimum articulated in (iii).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 127.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals therefore allowed Nigh to recover the full uncapped amount of $24,192.80 under clause (i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Gregory dissented.  The new clause (iii), he stated, operates as a specific \xe2\x80\x9ccarve-out\xe2\x80\x9d for real estate transactions from the general rule establishing the $100/$1,000 liability limitation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 130, 132.  Both parties acknowledged, and it was Fourth Circuit law under <em>Mars</em>, 713 F.\xc2\xa02d 65, that, before 1995, the $100/$1,000 brackets applied to the entire subparagraph.  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 130<em>.</em>  Judge Gregory found \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence that Congress intended to override the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding application of the $1,000 cap to both (2)(A)(i) and (2)(A)(ii).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 131.  If the $1,000 cap applied only to clause (ii), the dissent reasoned, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii) would be \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning of (ii) would be unchanged by its deletion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 132.  Moreover, Judge Gregory added, limiting the $1,000 cap to recoveries for consumer leases under clause (ii) would create an inconsistency within the statute: The damage cap in clause (ii) would include the \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d modifier, but the cap in clause (iii) would not.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1148/index.html">540 U.

In 1995, Congress plainly meant \xe2\x80\x9cto establish a more generous minimum and maximum\xe2\x80\x9d for closed-end mortgages.  <em>Strange</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 947.  On that point, there is no disagreement.  Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.

Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>Vanguard Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em>, 710 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 146.  As a result of the addition of clause (iii), closed-end mortgages are subject to a higher floor and ceiling.  But clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.  The specification of statutory damages in clause (i) of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Clause (iii) removes closed-end mortgages from clause (i)\xe2\x80\x99s governance only to the extent that clause (iii) prescribes $200/$2,000 brackets in lieu of $100/$1,000.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) when it added clause (iii).

By adding clause (iii), Congress sought to provide <em>increased recovery</em> when a TILA violation occurs in the context of a loan secured by real property.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

If Congress had not added \xe2\x80\x9c(iii)\xe2\x80\x9d when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.

Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (<em>e.g.</em>, a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  <em>Post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.   But even under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press%20releases/home_equity/prime_rate\n_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75\xe2\x80\x93100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages. </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961696">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n543 U.

I write separately, however, because I believe that it is unnecessary to rely on inferences from silence in the legislative history or the perceived anomalous results posed by an alternative interpretation to answer the question presented in this case<font b="1">.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 and n. 10.  Instead, in my view, the text of 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) prior to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 amendment to it, the consistent interpretation that the Courts of Appeals had given to the statutory language prior to the amendment, and the text of the amendment itself make clear that Congress tacked on a provision addressing a very specific set of transactions otherwise covered by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) but not materially altering the provisions at issue here.  </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the text in this case were clear, resort to anything else would be unwarranted.  See <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 532\xe2\x80\x93533 (2004).  But I agree with the Court that \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) is ambiguous, <em>ante</em>, at 1, rather than unambiguous as Justice Stevens contends, <em>ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion), because on its face it is susceptible of several plausible interpretations.  Congress, as the Court points out, used \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subparagraph\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d consistently in TILA, albeit not with perfect consistency, to refer to a third-level division introduced by a capital letter. See <em>ante</em>, at 10 and n.\xc2\xa04 (majority opinion).  This consistent usage points toward the view that \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d here refers to the whole of subdivision (A).  But other textual evidence is in tension with that reading.  As the Court of Appeals correctly pointed out and Justice Scalia notes, <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion), if \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the whole of subdivision (A), the limit of $100\xe2\x80\x93$1,000 for liability set forth in clause (ii) is in direct conflict with the $200\xe2\x80\x93$2,000 limit on liability found in clause (iii).  319 F.\xc2\xa03d 119, 126\xe2\x80\x93127 (CA4 2003).  Still other textual clues point away from the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading.  It is possible, for example, to read the $100\xe2\x80\x93$1,000 limit in clause (ii) to be an exception that applies only to the liability set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), since it comes after clauses (i) and (ii) but before clause (iii).  These conflicting textual indicators show that, whatever the practices suggested in the manuals relied upon by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 9 and n. 3, \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) is not a model of the best practices in legislative drafting.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory history of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A) resolves this ambiguity.  Prior to the 1995 amendment, the meaning of subdivisions (A)(i) and (ii) was clear.  As the Court recounts, after the 1976 amendment and prior to 1995, \xc2\xa71640(a) provided for statutory damages equal to</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9c(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, or (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease \xe2\x80\xa6 25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a) (1976 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">See <em>ante</em>, at 4.  There is no doubt that under this version of the statute the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d extended the liability limits to subdivision (A)(i) as well as subdivision (A)(ii).  As noted above, \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d is generally used in TILA to refer to a section\xe2\x80\x99s third-level subdivision introduced by a capital letter.  By virtue of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subparagraph,\xe2\x80\x9d the liability extended to the whole of subdivision (A).  The placement of this clause at the end of subdivision (A) further indicated that it was meant to refer to the whole of subdivision (A).  The clarity of the meaning is borne out by the Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 consistent application of the limit to both clauses (i) and (ii) as they stood before the 1995 amendment.  <em>Purtle </em>v. <em>Eldridge Auto Sales, Inc.</em>, 91 F.\xc2\xa03d 797, 800 (CA6 1996); <em>Cowen </em>v. <em>Bank United of Tex., FSB</em>, 70 F.\xc2\xa03d 937, 941 (CA7 1995); <em>Mars </em>v. <em>Spartanburg Chrysler Plymouth, Inc.</em>, 713 F.\xc2\xa02d 65, 67 and n. 6 (CA4 1983); <em>Dryden </em>v. <em>Lou Budke\xe2\x80\x99s Arrow Finance Co.</em>, 661 F.\xc2\xa02d 1186, 1191, n.\xc2\xa07 (CA8 1981); <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Public Finance Corp.</em>, 598 F.\xc2\xa02d  349, 359 and n. 17 (CA5 1979).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 amendment did not materially alter the text of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(i) or (ii).  It removed \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d between clauses (i) and (ii) and placed it between clause (ii) and the new clause (iii).  Pub. L. 104\xe2\x80\x9329, \xc2\xa76, 109 Stat. 274.  Apart from this change, it neither deleted any language from clause (i) or clause (ii) nor added any language to these clauses.  The only substantive change that amendment wrought was the creation of clause (iii), which established a higher $2,000 cap on damages for a very specific set of credit transactions\xe2\x80\x94closed-end credit transactions secured by real property or a dwelling\xe2\x80\x94that had previously been covered by \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A)(i) and subject to the lower $1,000 cap.  <em>Ibid.  </em>By so structuring the amendment, Congress evinced its intent to address only the creation of a different limit for a specific set of transactions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this history, as well as the text\xe2\x80\x99s clear meaning prior to the 1995 amendment and the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 consistent application of the limit in clause (ii) to clause (i) prior to the 1995 amendment, the limit in clause (ii) remains best read as applying also to clause (i). </p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961694">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n543 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7 1640(a)(2)(A)(ii), provides unambiguous instruction in resolving the issue: The word \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d directs that the $1,000 cap applies to recoveries under both clause (A)(i) and clause (A)(ii), as both fall under subparagraph (A).  Were we to adopt that analysis, our holdings in cases such as <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 533-35 (2004), <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Germain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/index.html">503 U.

S. 235</a>, 241-42 (1989), would be applicable, absent a showing that the result made little or no sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court properly chooses not to rest its holding solely on the words of the statute.  That is because of a counter-argument that \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be read straightforwardly to apply to all of subparagraph (A) in light of the different recovery cap of $2,000 for recoveries under clause (A)(iii).  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to proceed on the premise that the text is not altogether clear.  That means that examination of other interpretive resources, including predecessor statutes, is necessary for a full and complete understanding of the congressional intent.  This approach is fully consistent with cases in which, because the statutory provision at issue had only one plausible textual reading, we did not rely on such sources.  In the instant case, the Court consults extratextual sources and, in my view, looking to these materials confirms the usual interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961697">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nKOONS BUICK PONTIAC GMC, INC.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A).  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see <em>ante,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, by Justice Kennedy, see <em>ante,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (concurring opinion), and by Justice Thomas, see <em>ante,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph,\xe2\x80\x9d but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is \xe2\x80\x9cliability under this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After establishing the fact that \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see <em>ante,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See <em>ante,</em> at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cliability under this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, <em>in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe liability under this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the <em>only</em> liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then \xe2\x80\x9cliability under this subparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d is actually synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9cliability under this clause,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <em>ibid.,</em> in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d cannot end our inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: \xe2\x80\x9c(i) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, (ii) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, or (iii) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exception\xe2\x80\x94which appears between \xe2\x80\x9c(ii)\xe2\x80\x9d and the comma that precedes \xe2\x80\x9cor (iii)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in</em> clause (ii).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added); see also <em>ante,</em> at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe ceiling contained <em>in</em> (ii)\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Yet the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x94someplace where its reference to \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d can have a different effect than \xe2\x80\x9cclause\xe2\x80\x9d would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see <em>ante,</em> at 9, and n.\xc2\xa04, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafter\xe2\x80\x99s Desk Reference 223 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind <em>unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104\xe2\x80\x931, p.\xc2\xa024 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit <em>unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (1997) (explaining how to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cusing a cut-in followed by flush language,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See <em>ante,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As Justice Thomas points out, the placement of the exception \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of (A)\xe2\x80\x9d used to \xe2\x80\x9cindicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) \xe2\x80\x9ccontinues to apply\xe2\x80\x9d to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph\xe2\x80\x9d in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused <em>that</em> exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see <em>ante,</em> at 11, n.\xc2\xa09) to do further violence to \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds \xe2\x80\x9cscant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i)\xe2\x80\x9d in 1995 and compares this to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdog that didn\xe2\x80\x99t bark.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 11 (quoting <em>Church of Scientology of Cal.</em> v. <em>IRS,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/9/index.html">484 U. S. 9</a>, 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (1987)).  I hardly think it \xe2\x80\x9cscant indication\xe2\x80\x9d of intent to alter that Congress <em>amended the text of the statute</em> by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment <em>failed</em> to say.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  I have often criticized the Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverse\xe2\x80\x94and at least equally dangerous\xe2\x80\x94phenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congress\xe2\x80\x99s <em>own</em> words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.

S. 374</a>, 385, n.\xc2\xa02 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]egislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be \xe2\x80\x9canomalous\xe2\x80\x9d for liability to be \xe2\x80\x9cuncapped by the [$1,000] limit\xe2\x80\x9d when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cpassing strange\xe2\x80\x9d for damages to be \xe2\x80\x9c<em>substantially lower</em>\xe2\x80\x9d under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  <em>Ante,</em> at 12, and n.\xc2\xa010.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(e), naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  \xc2\xa71603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</em>  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000\xe2\x80\x94which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the <em>median</em> outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp.\xc2\xa0150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 3\xe2\x80\x9315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See <em>ibid.</em>  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As Justice Stevens acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a \xe2\x80\x9cplausible policy decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 1 (concurring opinion).  The Court should not fight the current structure of the statute merely to vindicate the suspicion that Congress actually made\xe2\x80\x94but neglected to explain clearly\xe2\x80\x94a different policy decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court noted earlier this year: \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.  It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might think is the preferred result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 542 (2004) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  I would apply the exception only to the clause with which it is associated and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress had not added \xe2\x80\x98(iii)\xe2\x80\x99 when it raised the cap on recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not so\xe2\x80\x94not, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See <em>supra,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  To adhere to <em>those</em> and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must \xe2\x80\x9cpretend\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress not only had not added \xe2\x80\x9c(iii)\xe2\x80\x9d but also had eliminated \xe2\x80\x9c(i)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c(ii).\xe2\x80\x9d  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The things that <em>were</em> said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also <em>id.,</em> at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he \xe2\x80\x9cclarif[ied]\xe2\x80\x9d his remarks by specifying that the amendments \xe2\x80\x9capply solely to loans secured by real estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to <em>all</em> \xe2\x80\x9cindividual actions\xe2\x80\x9d under subparagraph (A), or to all \xe2\x80\x9cloans secured by real estate\xe2\x80\x9d under clauses (i) <em>and</em> (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The medians were, of course, lower than the means: $49,000 for first mortgages, $11,000 for second mortgages, and $15,000 for HELOCs.  National Survey 25 (Table 1).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The 1994 survey did not report on the range of amounts owed on HELOCs.  In 2001, however, the Census Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s Housing Survey began reporting detailed data about HELOCs\xe2\x80\x94in figures presumably comparable to the 1994 data recited above, since the median outstanding balance and median interest rate for HELOCs had not dramatically changed.  (The 2001 medians were $17,517 and 8%.  See American Housing Survey 152, 154 (Table 3\xe2\x80\x9315).)</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
