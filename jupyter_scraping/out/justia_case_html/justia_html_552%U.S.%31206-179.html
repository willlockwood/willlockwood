The statute provides that a State shall not \xe2\x80\x9cestablish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa6 (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under [federal law] to the device, and \xe2\x80\xa6 (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under\xe2\x80\x9d relevant federal law.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a).  The MDA calls for federal oversight of medical devices that varies with the type of device at issue.  The most extensive oversight is reserved for Class III devices that undergo the premarket approval process.  These devices may enter the market only if the FDA reviews their design, labeling, and manufacturing specifications and determines that those specifications provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.  Manufacturers may not make changes to such devices that would affect safety or effectiveness unless they first seek and obtain permission from the FDA.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Charles Riegel and his wife, petitioner Donna Riegel, brought suit against respondent Medtronic after a Medtronic catheter ruptured in Charles Riegel\xe2\x80\x99s coronary artery during heart surgery.  The catheter is a Class III device that received FDA premarket approval.  The Riegels alleged that the device was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law.  The District Court held that the MDA pre-empted the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter, and their claim of negligent manufacturing insofar as the claim was not premised on the theory that Medtronic had violated federal law.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption clause bars common-law claims challenging the safety or effectiveness of a medical device marketed in a form that received premarket approval from the FDA.

S. C. \xc2\xa7360k, bars common-law claims challenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7301 <em>et seq.</em>, has long required FDA approval for the introduction of new drugs into the market.  Until the statutory enactment at issue here, however, the introduction of new medical devices was left largely for the States to supervise as they saw fit.  See<em> Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 475\xe2\x80\x93476 (1996).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulatory landscape changed in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, as complex devices proliferated and some failed.  Most notably, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, introduced in 1970, was linked to serious infections and several deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnancies.  Thousands of tort claims followed.  R. Bacigal, The Limits of Litigation: The Dalkon Shield Controversy 3 (1990).  In the view of many, the Dalkon Shield failure and its aftermath demonstrated the inability of the common-law tort system to manage the risks associated with dangerous devices.  See, <em>e.g., </em>S. Foote, Managing the Medical Arms Race 151\xe2\x80\x93152 (1992).  Several States adopted regulatory measures, including California, which in 1970 enacted a law requiring premarket approval of medical devices.  1970 Cal. Stats. ch. 1573, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa726670\xe2\x80\x9326693; see also Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After Medtronic, 64 Tenn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 691, 703, n. 66 (1997) (identifying 13 state statutes governing medical devices as of 1976).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress stepped in with passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7360c <em>et seq.</em>,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] which swept back some state obligations and imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight.  The MDA includes an express pre-emption provision that states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7360k(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe exception contained in subsection (b) permits the\nFDA to exempt some state and local requirements from\npre-emption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The new regulatory regime established various levels of oversight for medical devices, depending on the risks they present.  Class I, which includes such devices as elastic bandages and examination gloves, is subject to the lowest level of oversight: \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral controls,\xe2\x80\x9d such as labeling requirements.  \xc2\xa7360c(a)(1)(A); FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 14, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Class II, which includes such devices as powered wheelchairs and surgical drapes, <em>ibid.</em>, is subject in addition to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial controls\xe2\x80\x9d such as performance standards and postmarket surveillance measures, \xc2\xa7360c(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The devices receiving the most federal oversight are those in Class III, which include replacement heart valves, implanted cerebella stimulators, and pacemaker pulse generators, FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, <em>supra</em>.  In general, a device is assigned to Class III if it cannot be established that a less stringent classification would provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and the device is \xe2\x80\x9cpurported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7360c(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the MDA established a rigorous regime of premarket approval for new Class III devices, it grandfathered many that were already on the market.  Devices sold before the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date may remain on the market until the FDA promulgates, after notice and comment, a regulation requiring premarket approval.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7360c(f)(1), 360e(b)(1).  A related provision seeks to limit the competitive advantage grandfathered devices receive.  A new device need not undergo premarket approval if the FDA finds it is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to another device exempt from premarket approval.  \xc2\xa7360c(f)(1)(A).  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s review of devices for substantial equivalence is known as the \xc2\xa7510(k) process, named after the section of the MDA describing the review.  Most new Class III devices enter the market through \xc2\xa7510(k).  In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized the marketing of 3,148 devices under \xc2\xa7510(k) and granted premarket approval to just 32 devices.  P. Hutt, R. Merrill, &amp; L. Grossman, Food and Drug Law 992 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Premarket approval is a \xe2\x80\x9crigorous\xe2\x80\x9d process.  <em>Lohr</em>,<em> </em>518 U. S., at 477.  A manufacturer must submit what is typically a multivolume application.  FDA, Device Advice\xe2\x80\x94Premarket Approval (PMA) 18, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/\ndevadvice/pma/printer.html.  It includes, among other things, full reports of all studies and investigations of the device\xe2\x80\x99s safety and effectiveness that have been published or should reasonably be known to the applicant; a \xe2\x80\x9cfull statement\xe2\x80\x9d of the device\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9ca full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device\xe2\x80\x9d; samples or device components required by the FDA; and a specimen of the proposed labeling.  \xc2\xa7360e(c)(1).  Before deciding whether to approve the application, the agency may refer it to a panel of outside experts, 21 CFR \xc2\xa7814.44(a) (2007), and may request additional data from the manufacturer, \xc2\xa7360e(c)(1)(G).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each application, <em>Lohr, supra,</em> at 477, and grants premarket approval only if it finds there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable assurance\xe2\x80\x9d of the device\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csafety and effectiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7360e(d).  The agency must \xe2\x80\x9cweig[h] any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7360c(a)(2)(C).  It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives.  It approved, for example, under its Humanitarian Device Exemption procedures, a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts, even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent.  FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit 20 (2004), online at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/H030003b.pdf.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The premarket approval process includes review of the device\xe2\x80\x99s proposed labeling.  The FDA evaluates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label, \xc2\xa7360c(a)(2)(B), and must determine that the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading, \xc2\xa7360e(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After completing its review, the FDA may grant or deny premarket approval. \xc2\xa7360e(d).  It may also condition approval on adherence to performance standards, 21 CFR \xc2\xa7861.1(b)(3), restrictions upon sale or distribution, or compliance with other requirements, \xc2\xa7814.82.  The agency is also free to impose device-specific restrictions by regulation.  \xc2\xa7360j(e)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the FDA is unable to approve a new device in its proposed form, it may send an \xe2\x80\x9capprovable letter\xe2\x80\x9d indicating that the device could be approved if the applicant submitted specified information or agreed to certain conditions or restrictions.  21 CFR \xc2\xa7814.44(e).  Alternatively, the agency may send a \xe2\x80\x9cnot approvable\xe2\x80\x9d letter, listing the grounds that justify denial and, where practical, measures that the applicant could undertake to make the device approvable.  \xc2\xa7814.44(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a device has received premarket approval, the MDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA permission, changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes, labeling, or any other attribute, that would affect safety or effectiveness.  \xc2\xa7360e(d)(6)(A)(i).  If the applicant wishes to make such a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for supplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an initial application. \xc2\xa7360e(d)(6); 21 CFR \xc2\xa7814.39(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After premarket approval, the devices are subject to reporting requirements.  \xc2\xa7360i.  These include the obligation to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device which the applicant knows of or reasonably should know of, 21 CFR \xc2\xa7814.84(b)(2), and to report incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred, \xc2\xa7803.50(a).  The FDA has the power to withdraw premarket approval based on newly reported data or existing information and must withdraw approval if it determines that a device is unsafe or ineffective under the condi-\ntions in its labeling.  \xc2\xa7360e(e)(1); see also<em> </em>\xc2\xa7360h(e) (recall\nauthority).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Except as otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.  The device at issue is an Evergreen Balloon Catheter marketed by defendant-respondent Medtronic, Inc.  It is a Class III device that received premarket approval from the FDA in 1994; changes to its label received supplemental approvals in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Charles Riegel underwent coronary angioplasty in 1996, shortly after suffering a myocardial infarction.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.  His right coronary artery was diffusely diseased and heavily calcified.  Riegel\xe2\x80\x99s doctor inserted the Evergreen Balloon Catheter into his patient\xe2\x80\x99s coronary artery in an attempt to dilate the artery, although the device\xe2\x80\x99s labeling stated that use was contraindicated for patients with diffuse or calcified stenoses.  The label also warned that the catheter should not be inflated beyond its rated burst pressure of eight atmospheres.  Riegel\xe2\x80\x99s doctor inflated the catheter five times, to a pressure of 10 atmospheres; on its fifth inflation, the catheter ruptured.  Complaint 3.  Riegel developed a heart block, was placed on life support, and underwent emergency coronary bypass\nsurgery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Riegel and his wife Donna brought this lawsuit in April 1999, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.  Their complaint alleged that Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s catheter was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law, and that these defects caused Riegel to suffer severe and permanent injuries.  The complaint raised a number of common-law claims.  The District Court held that the MDA pre-empted Riegel\xe2\x80\x99s claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a; Complaint 3\xe2\x80\x934.  It also held that the MDA pre-empted a negligent manufacturing claim insofar as it was not premised on the theory that Medtronic violated federal law.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a.  Finally, the court concluded that the MDA pre-empted Donna Riegel\xe2\x80\x99s claim for loss of consortium to the extent it was derivative of the pre-empted claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 68a; see also<em> id.,</em> at 75a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed these dismissals.<em> </em>451 F.\xc2\xa03d 104 (2006).

If so, we must then determine whether the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 common-law claims are based upon New York requirements with respect to the device that are \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from, or in addition to\xe2\x80\x9d the federal ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness.  \xc2\xa7360k(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the first question.  In <em>Lohr</em>, a majority of this Court interpreted the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision in a manner \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially informed\xe2\x80\x9d by the FDA regulation set forth at 21 CFR \xc2\xa7808.1(d).  518 U. S., at 495; see also<em> id.</em>,<em> </em>at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  That regulation says that state requirements are pre-empted \xe2\x80\x9conly when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7808.1(d).  Informed by the regulation, we concluded that federal manufacturing and labeling requirements applicable across the board to almost all medical devices did not pre-empt the common-law claims of negligence and strict liability at issue in <em>Lohr</em>.  The federal requirements, we said, were not requirements specific to the device in question\xe2\x80\x94they reflected \xe2\x80\x9centirely generic concerns about device regulation generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 U. S., at 501.  While we disclaimed a conclusion that general federal requirements could never pre-empt, or general state duties never be pre-empted, we held that no pre-emption occurred in the case at hand based on a careful comparison between the state and federal duties at issue.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though substantial-equivalence review under \xc2\xa7510(k) is device specific, <em>Lohr </em>also rejected the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xc2\xa7510(k) approval imposed device-specific \xe2\x80\x9crequirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  We regarded the fact that products entering the market through \xc2\xa7510(k) may be marketed only so long as they remain substantial equivalents of the relevant pre-1976 devices as a qualification for an exemption rather than a requirement.  <em>Id., </em>at 493\xe2\x80\x93494; see also<em> id., </em>at 513 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Premarket approval, in contrast, imposes \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d under the MDA as we interpreted it in <em>Lohr</em>. Unlike general labeling duties, premarket approval is specific to individual devices. And it is in no sense an exemption from federal safety review\xe2\x80\x94it <em>is </em>federal safety review.  Thus, the attributes that <em>Lohr </em>found lacking in \xc2\xa7510(k) review are present here.  While \xc2\xa7510(k) is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98focused on <em>equivalence</em>, not safety,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 493 (opinion of the Court), premarket approval is focused on safety, not equivalence.  While devices that enter the market through \xc2\xa7510(k) have \xe2\x80\x9cnever been formally reviewed under the MDA for safety or efficacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the FDA may grant premarket approval only after it determines that a device offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, \xc2\xa7360e(d).  And while the FDA does not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98require\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that a device allowed to enter the market as a substantial equivalent \xe2\x80\x9ctake any particular form for any particular reason,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em>  at 493, the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application, for the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn, then, to the second question: whether the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 common-law claims rely upon \xe2\x80\x9cany requirement\xe2\x80\x9d of New York law applicable to the catheter that is \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from, or in addition to\xe2\x80\x9d federal requirements and that \xe2\x80\x9crelates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7360k(a).  Safety and effectiveness are the very subjects of the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 common-law claims, so the critical issue is whether New York\xe2\x80\x99s tort duties constitute \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d under the MDA.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Lohr,</em> five Justices concluded that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose \xe2\x80\x9crequirement[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and would be pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device.  See 518 U. S., at 512 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ.); <em>id., </em>at 503\xe2\x80\x93505 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  We adhere to that view.  In interpreting two other statutes we have likewise held that a provision pre-empting state \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d pre-empted common-law duties.  <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/431/index.html">544 U. S. 431</a> (2005), found common-law actions to be pre-empted by a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that said certain States \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall not impose or continue in effect <em>any requirements </em>for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id., </em>at 443<em> </em>(discussing 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7136v(b); emphasis added).  <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U. S. 504</a> (1992), held common-law actions pre-empted by a provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71334(b), which said that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o requirement<em> </em>or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\xe2\x80\x9d whose packages were labeled in accordance with federal law.  See<em> </em>505 U. S.,<em> </em>at 523 (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 548\xe2\x80\x93549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regularly used in its enactments.  Absent other indication, reference to a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d includes its common-law duties.  As the plurality opinion said in <em>Cipollone, </em>common-law liability is \xe2\x80\x9cpremised on the existence of a legal duty,\xe2\x80\x9d and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a state-law obligation.  <em>Id</em>., at 522.  And while the common-law remedy is limited to damages, a liability award \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Id.,</em> at 521.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, there is nothing to contradict this normal meaning.  To the contrary, in the context of this legislation excluding common-law duties from the scope of pre-emption would make little sense.  State tort law that requires a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect.  Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation.  A state statute, or a regulation adopted by a state agency, could at least be expected to apply cost-benefit analysis similar to that applied by the experts at the FDA: How many more lives will be saved by a device which, along with its greater effectiveness, brings a greater risk of harm?  A jury, on the other hand, sees only the cost of a more dangerous design, and is not concerned with its benefits; the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court.  As Justice Breyer explained in <em>Lohr</em>, it is implausible that the MDA was meant to \xe2\x80\x9cgrant greater power (to set state standards \xe2\x80\x98different from, or in addition to\xe2\x80\x99 federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 U. S., at 504.  That perverse distinction is not required or even suggested by the broad language Congress chose in the MDA,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and we will not turn somersaults to create it.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent would narrow the pre-emptive scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d on the grounds that it is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\xe2\x80\x9d for consumers injured by FDA-approved devices.  <em>Post</em>, at 5 (opinion of Ginsburg,\xc2\xa0J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But, as we have explained, this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for medical devices does by its terms.  The operation of a law enacted by Congress need not be seconded by a committee report on pain of judicial nullification. See, <em>e.g., Connecticut Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Germain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/index.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (1992).  It is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives.  If we were to do so, however, the only indication available\xe2\x80\x94 the text of the statute\xe2\x80\x94suggests that the solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the dissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the FDA has supported the position taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of the statute.  We have found it unnecessary to rely upon that agency view because we think the statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue.  If, however, we had found the statute ambiguous and had accorded the agency\xe2\x80\x99s current position deference, the dissent is correct, see <em>post, </em>at 6, n.\xc2\xa08, that\xe2\x80\x94inasmuch as mere <em>Skidmore </em>deference would seemingly be at issue\xe2\x80\x94the degree of deference might be reduced by the fact that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s earlier position was different.  See <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a> (1944); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a> (2001); <em>Good Samaritan Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/508/402/index.html">508 U. S. 402</a>, 417 (1993).  But of course the agency\xe2\x80\x99s earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length, <em>post, </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936, and finds preferable) is even more compromised, indeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent also describes at great length the experience under the FDCA with respect to drugs and food and color additives.  <em>Post,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x9311.  Two points render the conclusion the dissent seeks to draw from that experience\xe2\x80\x94that the pre-emption clause permits tort suits\xe2\x80\x94unreliable.  (1) It has not been established (as the dissent assumes) that no tort lawsuits are pre-empted by drug or additive approval under the FDCA. (2) If, as the dissent believes, the pre-emption clause permits tort lawsuits for medical devices just as they are (by hypothesis) permitted for drugs and additives; and if, as the dissent believes, Congress wanted the two regimes to be alike; Congress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA.  It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Riegels contend that the duties underlying negligence, strict-liability, and implied-warranty claims are not pre-empted even if they impose \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98requirements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because general common-law duties are not requirements maintained \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with respect to devices.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9336.   Again, a majority of this Court suggested otherwise in <em>Lohr.  </em>See 518 U. S., at 504\xe2\x80\x93505 (opinion of Breyer, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 514 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ.).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And with good reason.  The language of the statute does not bear the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 reading.  The MDA provides that no State \xe2\x80\x9cmay establish or continue in effect <em>with respect to a device \xe2\x80\xa6</em> <em>any requirement</em>\xe2\x80\x9d relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements.  \xc2\xa7360k(a) (emphasis added).  The Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 suit depends upon New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinu[ing] in effect\xe2\x80\x9d general tort duties \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to\xe2\x80\x9d Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s catheter.  Nothing in the statutory text suggests that the pre-empted state requirement must apply <em>only </em>to the relevant device, or only to medical devices and not to all products and all actions in general.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 argument to the contrary rests on the text of an FDA regulation which states that the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption clause does not extend to certain duties, including \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(1).  Even assuming that this regulation could play a role in defining the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope, it does not provide unambiguous support for the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 position.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s reading of its own rule is entitled to substantial deference, see <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461 (1997), and the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s view put forward in this case is that the regulation does not refer to general tort duties of care, such as those underlying the claims in this case that a device was designed, labeled, or manufactured in an unsafe or ineffective manner.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  That is so, according to the FDA, because the regulation excludes from pre-emption requirements that relate only incidentally to medical devices, but not other requirements.  General tort duties of care, unlike fire codes or restrictions on trade practices, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly regulate\xe2\x80\x9d the device itself, including its design.  <em>Id.,</em> at 28.  We find the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation less than compelling, since the same could\nbe said of general requirements imposed by electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade-practice law, which the regulation specifically excludes from pre-emption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other portions of 21 CFR \xc2\xa7808.1, however, support the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(1) has no application to this case (though still failing to explain why electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code or unfair-trade-practice requirements are different).  Section 808.1(b) states that the MDA sets forth a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d pre-empting state duties \xe2\x80\x9chaving the force and effect of law (whether established by statute, ordinance, regulation,<em> or court decision</em>) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  This sentence is far more comprehensible under the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(1) has no application here than under the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 view.  We are aware of no duties established by court decision other than common-law duties, and we are aware of no common-law duties that relate solely to medical devices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 reading is also in tension with the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s statement that adulteration and misbranding claims are pre-empted when they \xe2\x80\x9cha[ve] the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e.g., a specific labeling requirement\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from, or in addition to\xe2\x80\x9d a federal requirement.  \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(6)(ii).  Surely this means that the MDA would pre-empt a jury determination that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker violated a state common-law requirement for additional warnings.  The Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(1), however, would allow a claim for tortious mislabeling to escape pre-emption so long as such a claim could also be brought against objects other than medical devices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All in all, we think that \xc2\xa7808.1(d)(1) can add nothing to our analysis but confusion.  Neither accepting nor rejecting the proposition that this regulation can properly be consulted to determine the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning; and neither accepting nor rejecting the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between general requirements that directly regulate and those that regulate only incidentally; the regulation fails to alter our interpretation of the text insofar as the outcome of this case is concerned. </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State requirements are pre-empted under the MDA only to the extent that they are \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from, or in addition to\xe2\x80\x9d the requirements imposed by federal law.  \xc2\xa7360k(a)(1).  Thus, \xc2\xa7360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case \xe2\x80\x9cparallel,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than add to, federal requirements.  <em>Lohr, </em>518 U. S., at 495; see also<em> id.</em>,<em> </em>at 513 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The District Court in this case recognized that parallel claims would not be pre-empted, see<em> </em>App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a\xe2\x80\x9371a, but it interpreted the claims here to assert that Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s device violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance\nwith the relevant federal requirements, see <em>id.,</em> at\n68a.  Although the Riegels now argue that their law-\nsuit raises parallel claims, they made no such conten-\ntion in their briefs before the Second Circuit, nor did they raise this argument in their petition for certiorari.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k, was not fully appreciated until many years after it was enacted.  It is an example of a statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors.  In such cases we have frequently concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (1998).  Accordingly, while I agree with Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s description of the actual history and principal purpose of the pre-emption provision at issue in this case, <em>post,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x9311 (dissenting opinion), I am persuaded that its text does preempt state law requirements that differ.  I therefore write separately to add these few words about the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s history and the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crequirements.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is nothing in the preenactment history of the MDA suggesting that Congress thought state tort remedies had impeded the development of medical devices.  Nor is there any evidence at all to suggest that Congress decided that the cost of injuries from Food and Drug Administration-approved medical devices was outweighed \xe2\x80\x9cby solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 13 (opinion of the Court).  That is a policy argument advanced by the Court, not by Congress.  As Justice Ginsburg persuasively explains, the overriding purpose of the legislation was to provide additional protection to consumers, not to withdraw existing protections.  It was the then-recent development of state premarket regulatory regimes that explained the need for a provision pre-empting conflicting administrative rules.  See <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 489 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress enacted \xc2\xa7360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations rather than the general duties enforced by common-law actions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the language of the provision reaches beyond such regulatory regimes to encompass other types of \xe2\x80\x9crequirements.\xe2\x80\x9d<font b="1">  Because common-law rules administered by judges, like statutes and regulations, create and define legal obligations, some of them unquestionably qualify as \xe2\x80\x9crequirements.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See <em>Cipollone</em> v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U. S. 504</a>, 522 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ommon-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose \xe2\x80\x98requirements or prohibitions.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 [I]t is the essence of the common law to enforce duties that are either affirmative <em>requirements</em> or negative <em>prohibitions</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (plurality opinion) (emphasis added)).  And although not all common-law rules qualify as \xe2\x80\x9crequirements,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the Court correctly points out that five Justices in <em>Lohr</em> concluded that the common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability at issue in that case imposed \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d that were pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device.  Moreover, I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cogent explanation of why the Riegels\xe2\x80\x99 claims are predicated on New York common-law duties that constitute requirements with respect to the device at issue that differ from federal requirements relating to safety and effectiveness.  I therefore join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and all of its opinion except for Parts III\xe2\x80\x93A and III\xe2\x80\x93B. </font></p><font b="1">\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The verdicts of juries who obey those rules, however, are not \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d of that kind.  Juries apply rules, but do not make them.  And while a jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of liability may induce a defendant to alter its device or its label, this does not render the finding a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the MDA.  \xe2\x80\x9cA requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision is not a requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bates</em> v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/431/index.html">544 U.

The MDA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a), the Court holds, spares medical device manufacturers from personal injury claims alleging flaws in a design or label once the application for the design or label has gained premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); a state damages remedy, the Court instructs, persists only for claims \xe2\x80\x9cpremised on a violation of FDA regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  I dissent from today\xe2\x80\x99s constriction of state authority.  Congress, in my view, did not intend \xc2\xa7360k(a) to effect a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reason for enacting \xc2\xa7360k(a) is evident.  Until 1976, the Federal Government did not engage in premarket regulation of medical devices.  Some States acted to fill the void by adopting their own regulatory systems for medical devices.  Section 360k(a) responded to that state regulation, and particularly to California\xe2\x80\x99s system of premarket approval for medical devices, by preempting State initiatives absent FDA permission.  See \xc2\xa7360k(b).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone of pre-emption analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cipollone</em> v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U.

Courts have \xe2\x80\x9clong presumed that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/470/index.html">518 U.

Given the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cprimacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U.

A preemption clause tells us that Congress intended to supersede or modify state law to some extent.  In the absence of legislative precision, however, courts may face the task of determining the substance and scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 displacement of state law.  Where the text of a preemption clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9caccept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bates</em>, 544 U.

That remedy, although important, does not help consumers injured by devices that receive FDA approval but nevertheless prove unsafe.  The MDA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to create any federal compensatory remedy for such consumers further suggests that Congress did not intend broadly to preempt state common-law suits grounded on allegations independent of FDA requirements.  It is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\xe2\x80\x9d for large numbers of consumers injured by defective medical devices.  <em>Silkwood</em> v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/238/index.html">464 U.

FDA regulation of a device cannot anticipate and protect against all safety risks to individual consumers.  Even the most thorough regulation of a product such as a critical medical device may fail to identify potential problems presented by the product.  Regulation cannot protect against all possible injuries that might result from use of a device over time.  Preemption of all such claims would result in the loss of a significant layer of consumer protection \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Porter, The <em>Lohr</em> Decision: FDA Perspective and Position, 52 Food &amp; Drug L.\xc2\xa0J. 7, 11 (1997).</p>\n<p align="left">\nCf.

Thus the FDA may order the manufacturer to repair the device, replace it, refund the purchase price, cease distribution, or recall the device.  \xc2\xa7360h(b)(2), (e).  The prospect of ameliorative action by the FDA, however, lends no support to the conclusion that Congress intended largely to preempt state common-law suits.  Quite the opposite: Section 360h(d) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with an order issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  That provision anticipates \xe2\x80\x9c[court-awarded] damages for economic loss\xe2\x80\x9d from which the value of any FDA-ordered remedy would be subtracted.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the MDA after decades of regulating drugs and food and color additives under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.

The FDCA contains no preemption clause, and thus the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7360k(a) has no bearing on tort suits involving drugs and additives.  But \xc2\xa7360k(a)\xe2\x80\x99s confinement to medical devices hardly renders irrelevant to the proper construction of the MDA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision the long history of federal and state controls over drugs and additives in the interest of public health and welfare.

I therefore turn to an examination of that experience.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Starting in 1938, the FDCA required that new drugs undergo preclearance by the FDA before they could be marketed.

Premarket control, as already noted, commenced with drugs in 1938.  In 1958, Congress required premarket approval for food additives.  Food Additives Amendment, \xc2\xa73, 72 Stat. 1785, as amended, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7348.  In 1960, it required premarket approval for color additives.

Section 360k(a) must preempt state common-law suits, Medtronic contends, because Congress would not have wanted state juries to second-guess the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s finding that a medical device is safe and effective when used as directed.  Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9349.  The Court is similarly minded.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the premarket approval process for medical devices.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Courts that have considered the question have overwhelmingly held that FDA approval of a new drug application does not preempt state tort suits.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Decades of drug regulation thus indicate, contrary to Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s argument, that Congress did not regard FDA regulation and state tort claims as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Refusing to read \xc2\xa7360k(a) as an automatic bar to state common-law tort claims would hardly render the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s premarket approval of Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s medical device application irrelevant to the instant suit.  First, a \xe2\x80\x9cpre-emption provision, by itself, does not foreclose (through negative implication) any possibility of implied conflict preemption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U.

Accordingly, a medical device manufacturer may have a dispositive defense if it can identify an actual conflict between the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s theory of the case and the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s premarket approval of the device in question.  As currently postured, this case presents no occasion to take up this issue for Medtronic relies exclusively on \xc2\xa7360k(a) and does not argue conflict preemption.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, a medical device manufacturer may be entitled to interpose a regulatory compliance defense based on the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the premarket application.  Most States do not treat regulatory compliance as dispositive, but regard it as one factor to be taken into account by the jury.  See Sharkey, Federalism in Action: FDA Regulatory Preemption in Pharmaceutical Cases in State Versus Federal Courts, 15 J. Law &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 1013, 1024 (2007).

Instead, regardless of the strength of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case, suits will be barred <em>ab initio</em>.
