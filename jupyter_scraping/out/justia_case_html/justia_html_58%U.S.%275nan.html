Stafford and Jeannette Kirkland Stafford, his wife, whereby your petitioner sought to obtain a foreclosure of a certain mortgage, held by it on certain negro slaves, then in the possession of the said defendants, but at the hearing in the said court and by the decree thereof the said bill was dismissed.  And your petitioner further showeth that from the decree of the said court directing the dismissal of the said bill an appeal was prayed by your petitioner to this Court, and at the December term, 1851, the said decree was reversed and the cause remanded to the said district court with directions to that court to enter a decree in favor of your petitioner, and accordingly such a decree was in fact rendered by the said district court on the 25th of February, 1854, whereby it was in substance directed that the sums accruing from the hire of the mortgaged slaves, while in the custody of the receiver, <em>pendente lite,</em> amounting to $25,379.39, should be paid by the receiver to the complainant and credited on the total amount found to be due by the defendants, and that in case the defendants failed to pay over the balance remaining due after such credit, amounting to $39,877.13, on the 1st day of July, 1854, they should be foreclosed of their equity of redemption, and the marshal should seize and sell the mortgaged slaves at public auction, on the third day of the same month, or as soon thereafter as may be, after giving three months\' notice, by advertisement, of the time, place, and terms of sale, and should pay to the complainant, your petitioner, out of the proceeds of such sale, the aforesaid sum of $39,877.13, in satisfaction of the debt secured by the said mortgage.

The Court, therefore, order that a peremptory mandamus issue commanding the judge forthwith to carry the decree into effect.</p>\n<p>But as the security given was sufficient to bring the cause before the Court by appeal, though not sufficient to suspend the execution of the same, the Court overruled the motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The Honorable John C.

Stafford and wife."</p>\n<p>"The respondent respectfully answers and certifies to the Honorable the Supreme Court of the United States that on the 6th day of March, 1854, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Texas at Galveston, which was within ten days next after the rendition of the decree mentioned in the caption to this answer, the said Josiah S. Stafford and wife, feeling </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 58 U. S. 281</a></p><p> themselves aggrieved by the rendition of the same, in open court applied for and prayed an appeal to the next term thereafter of this Court, to be held in the City of Washington on the first Monday in December thereafter, which to them was granted upon condition that they entered into good and sufficient bond with good and sufficient security in the sum of $10,000, conditioned that they prosecute their appeal with effect and answer all damages and costs if they should fail to make their plea good, and thereafter and on the same day and year aforesaid, the said Josiah S. Stafford and wife, in open court, tendered a bond with L. C. Stanley, Patrick Perry, and William H. Clark as sureties, in the sum of $10,000, and the Court having inspected the bond, and being satisfied that it was in conformity to law and the order of the Court, and that the sureties were good and sufficient.  \'It was ordered that the bond be approved, and it was ordered to be entered, that the bond of April, taken and filed in this cause, operates as a supersedeas to the decree of the Court,\' and thereupon and immediately after the order granting said appeal, and the giving bond as aforesaid, and while the same remained in full force, unreversed and not set aside, this respondent respectfully submits that neither in the said district court or in vacation had he any longer jurisdiction over the cause between the parties aforesaid or any power or authority to make any order in regard to the supersedeas or to enforce the execution of the decree aforesaid for the reason that thenceforward, by virtue of the appeal so taken and perfected as aforesaid, the said cause between the parties aforesaid had passed into and under the control of this court, and which was the proper forum only in which any such order could or can be rightly made."</p>\n<p>"This respondent further respectfully submits that though, upon investigation, it should turn out that the bond given for the appeal as aforesaid was not taken in all respects in conformity to the requirements of law, but might be irregular and depart from such requirements in regard to the amount of the penalty thereof or in other respects, yet this did not render the grant of the appeal merely void or in any manner affect the supersedeas operated by law, but that the said appeal and the said supersedeas was and continued to be in full force and effect, and thus will remain until this Court, in conformity to its practice, shall dismiss said appeal, and thereby discharge said supersedeas on account of a failure by the said Josiah S. Stafford and wife, when thereto required to give such bond as the law requires, within such time as the Court may prescribe."</p>\n<p>"This respondent further respectfully submits that the bond taken and approved, and upon which the appeal before mentioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 58 U. S. 282</a></p><p> was granted, was taken and executed in full, complete, and perfect conformity to law, and had he power and authority either in term time or in vacation to make any order in regard to said supersedeas, or the enforcement of the decree aforesaid by execution, and an application were made to him for such order, by reason of the said bond\'s not being in the penalty or to the amount required by law, he would feel himself constrained to refuse any such order."</p>\n<p>"And these are the causes and reasons which this respondent has to offer why a mandamus should not issue to enforce a discharge of the supersedeas or an execution of the decree aforesaid."</p>\n<p>"But he respectfully submits to the judgment of the Court, and will enforce, by order, any direction given by the court in the premises.  The respondent respectfully refers to the brief of the counsel of the said Josiah S. Stafford and wife, which will be filed in this Honorable Court, and the authorities therein referred to, in support and maintenance of the position assumed by this answer."</p>\n<p>"JOHN C. WATROUS"</p>\n<p>And after due deliberation thereupon, had, it appearing to the Court that it was the duty of the judge, in allowing the appeal, to take security on the appeal in the sum decreed, and not having done so, that the appellant was not entitled to a supersedeas of any process necessary to carry the decree into execution, and that the judge was bound to issue the proper process on the application of the complainant.  It is therefore now here directed and ordered by this Court that a mandamus be awarded to the District Judge of the United States for the District of Texas requiring and commanding the said judge forthwith to carry the aforesaid decree of the said district court of the 25th of February, A.D. 1854, into effect.</p>\n<p><em><em>After-Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the</p>\n<p>District Court of the United States for the District of Texas, and it appearing to the Court here that a stipulation by the counsel of the respective parties to dismiss this appeal at the costs of the appellants, has been filed in this cause.  It is thereupon, on the motion of Mr. Coxe, of counsel for the appellee, now here ordered and decreed by this Court that this appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed with costs.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
