A securities fraud complaint is timely if filed no more than \xe2\x80\x9c2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d or 5 years after the violation.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(b).  The District Court dismissed the complaint as untimely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the <em>possibility</em> of Merck\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to undertake a reasonably diligent investigation at that time.  Among the relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 \xe2\x80\x9cVIGOR\xe2\x80\x9d study comparing Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse cardiovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning letter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck\xe2\x80\x99s Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was \xe2\x80\x9cfalse, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) pleadings filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 alleging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and intentionally downplayed its risks.  The Third Circuit reversed, holding that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted with scienter, an element of a \xc2\xa710(b) violation, and consequently did not commence the running of the limitations period. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The limitations period in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) begins to run once the plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whichever comes first.  In the statute of limitations context, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d is often used as a term of art in connection with the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery rule,\xe2\x80\x9d a doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered\xe2\x80\x9d it.  The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures have sometimes codified this rule.  When \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d is written directly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.  Congress intended courts to interpret the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) similarly.  That statute was enacted after this Court determined a governing limitations period for private \xc2\xa710(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow</em> v. <em>Gilbertson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/350/index.html">501 U. S. 350</a>, concluding that such actions \xe2\x80\x9cmust be commenced within one year <em>after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 ,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 364 (emphasis added).  Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have held that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d occurs both when a plaintiff <em>actually </em>discovers the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would<em> </em>have discovered them.  In 2002, Congress repeated <em>Lampf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s critical language in enacting the present limitations statute.  Normally, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Lynchburg College</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/106/index.html">535 U. S. 106</a>, 116\xe2\x80\x93117, and n.\xc2\xa013.  Given the history and precedent surrounding the use of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in the limitations context generally as well as in this provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly strong here.  Merck\xe2\x80\x99s claims are evaluated accordingly.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0In determining the time at which \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d occurs, terms such as \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstorm warnings\xe2\x80\x9d may be useful insofar as they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating.  But the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would<em> </em>have discovered \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts constituting the violation,\xe2\x80\x9d including scienter\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Contrary to Merck\xe2\x80\x99s argument, facts showing scienter are among those that \xe2\x80\x9cconstitut[e] the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scienter is assuredly a \xe2\x80\x9cfact.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a \xc2\xa710(b) action, it refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/index.html">425 U. S. 185</a>, 194, n.\xc2\xa012, and \xe2\x80\x9cconstitut[es]\xe2\x80\x9d an important and necessary element of a \xc2\xa710(b) \xe2\x80\x9cviolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Tellabs, Inc.</em> v. <em>Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/308/index.html">551 U. S. 308</a>, 319.  Because the scienter element of \xc2\xa710(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2), unless a \xc2\xa710(b) complaint sets out facts showing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with the relevant intent, the claim will fail.  It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d any facts suggesting scienter.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court also rejects Merck\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, even if \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter.  Where \xc2\xa710(b) is at issue, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.  For instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm\xe2\x80\x99s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliberately lied or made an innocent error.  Hence, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of additional scienter-related facts may be required.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of an unqualified bar on actions instituted \xe2\x80\x9c5 years after such violation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71658(b)(2), should diminish Merck\xe2\x80\x99s fear that this requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago.  P. 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0And the Court cannot accept Merck\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the limitations period begins at \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning the point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d facts showing scienter or other \xe2\x80\x9cfacts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute says that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim accrues only after the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of those latter facts.  It contains no indication that the limitations period can sometimes begin <em>before </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d can take place.  Merck also argues that determining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the necessary facts is too complicated for judges to undertake.  But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this kind of inquiry in securities fraud cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The FDA\xe2\x80\x99s September 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here-relevant scienter, <em>i.e</em>., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent intent.  The FDA itself described the hypothesis as a \xe2\x80\x9cpossible explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable alternative, that Vioxx might be harmful.  The products-liability complaints\xe2\x80\x99 general statements about Merck\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind show little more.  Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-November 2001 circumstances reveal \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d indicating the relevant scienter.

The plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  See 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U.

Therefore, the critical date for timeliness purposes is November 6, 2001\xe2\x80\x94two years before this complaint was filed.  Merck claims that before this date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, by the time the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) had run.  The plaintiffs reply that they had not, and could not have, discovered by the critical date those \xe2\x80\x9cfacts,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly not the facts related to scienter, and that their complaint was therefore timely.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts, as we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and the opinions below.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>1.</em> <em>1990\xe2\x80\x99s.  </em>In the mid-1990\xe2\x80\x99s Merck developed Vioxx.  In 1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for prescription use.  Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting the body\xe2\x80\x99s production of an enzyme called COX\xe2\x80\x932 (cyclooxygenase-2).  COX\xe2\x80\x932 is associated with pain and inflammation.  Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its class like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not inhibit production of a second enzyme called COX\xe2\x80\x931 (cyclooxygenase-1).  COX\xe2\x80\x931 plays a part in the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract and also inhibits platelet aggregation (associated with blood clots).  App. 50\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>2.</em> <em>March 2000</em>.  Merck announced the results of a study, called the \xe2\x80\x9cVIGOR\xe2\x80\x9d study.  <em>Id.</em>, at 291\xe2\x80\x93294.  The study compared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen.  The study showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer gastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped).  But the study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every 1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks, compared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took naproxen.  <em>Id.</em>, at 296, 306; see Bombardier et\xc2\xa0al., Comparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib and Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343 New England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526\xe2\x80\x931527 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Merck\xe2\x80\x99s press release acknowledged VIGOR\xe2\x80\x99s adverse cardiovascular data.  But Merck said that these data were \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with naproxen\xe2\x80\x99s ability to block platelet aggregation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 291.  Merck noted that, since \xe2\x80\x9cVioxx, like all COX\xe2\x80\x932 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggregation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And Merck added that \xe2\x80\x9csafety data from all other completed and ongoing clinical trials \xe2\x80\xa6 showed no indication of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic events between Vioxx\xe2\x80\x9d and either a placebo or comparable drugs.  <em>Id.</em>, at 293 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This theory\xe2\x80\x94that VIGOR\xe2\x80\x99s troubling cardiovascular findings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx\xe2\x80\x94later became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cnaproxen hypothesis.\xe2\x80\x9d  In advancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the naproxen benefit \xe2\x80\x9chad not been observed previously.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 291.  Journalists and stock market analysts reported all of the above\xe2\x80\x94the positive gastrointestinal results, the troubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis, and the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.  See <em>id.</em>, at 355\xe2\x80\x93391, 508\xe2\x80\x93557.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>3.</em> <em>February 2001 to August 2001.</em>  Public debate about the naproxen hypothesis continued.  In February 2001, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider Merck\xe2\x80\x99s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect VIGOR\xe2\x80\x99s positive gastrointestinal findings.  The VIGOR cardiovascular findings were also discussed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 392\xe2\x80\x93395, 558\xe2\x80\x93577.  In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a products-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that \xe2\x80\x9cMerck\xe2\x80\x99s own research\xe2\x80\x9d had demonstrated that \xe2\x80\x9cusers of Vioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as compared to other less expensive, medications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 869.  In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical Association wrote that the available data raised a \xe2\x80\x9ccautionary flag\xe2\x80\x9d and strongly urged that \xe2\x80\x9ca trial specifically assessing cardiovascular risk\xe2\x80\x9d be done.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331\xe2\x80\x93332; Mukherjee, Nissen, &amp; Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular Events Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286 JAMA 954 (2001).  At about the same time, Bloomberg News quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck had \xe2\x80\x9cadditional data\xe2\x80\x9d that were \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very reassuring,\xe2\x80\x9d and Merck issued a press release stating that it stood \xe2\x80\x9cbehind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile \xe2\x80\xa6 of Vioxx.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>4.</em> <em>September and October 2001.</em>  The FDA sent Merck a warning letter released to the public on September 21, 2001.  It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,  Merck\xe2\x80\x99s Vioxx marketing was \xe2\x80\x9cfalse, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 339.  At the same time, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis was a \xe2\x80\x9cpossible explanation\xe2\x80\x9d of the VIGOR results.  <em>Id.</em>, at 340.  But it found that Merck\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpromotional campaign selectively present[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that hypothesis without adequately acknowledging \xe2\x80\x9canother reasonable explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [<em>i.e.</em>, adverse cardiovascular]<em> </em>properties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The FDA ordered Merck to send healthcare providers a corrective letter.  <em>Id.</em>, at 353.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the FDA letter was released, more products-liability lawsuits were filed.

On October 9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexamined its own data and \xe2\x80\x9cfound no evidence that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 504.

October 2003</em>.  The Wall Street Journal<em> </em>published the results of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital.  After examining the medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare patients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to-90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart attack than those given either a different painkiller or no painkiller at all<em>.</em> <em>Id</em>., at 164\xe2\x80\x93165.  (That is to say, if patients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at all suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of patients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)  Merck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 165\xe2\x80\x93167.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>2.</em> <em>September 30, 2004</em>.  Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market.  It said that a new study had found \xe2\x80\x9can increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 182 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A Merck representative publicly described the results as \xe2\x80\x9ctotally unexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 186.  Merck\xe2\x80\x99s shares fell by 27% the same day.  <em>Id.</em>, at 185, 856.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>3.</em> <em>November 1, 2004</em>.  The Wall Street Journal<em> </em>published an article stating that \xe2\x80\x9cinternal Merck e-mails and marketing materials as well as interviews with outside scientists show that the company fought forcefully for years to keep safety concerns from destroying the drug\xe2\x80\x99s commercial prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 189\xe2\x80\x93190.  The article said that an early e-mail from Merck\xe2\x80\x99s head of research had said that the VIGOR \xe2\x80\x9cresults showed that the cardiovascular events \xe2\x80\x98are clearly there,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a shame but \xe2\x80\xa6 a low incidence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is mechanism based as we worried it was.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 192.  It also said that Merck had given its salespeople instructions to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98DODGE\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d questions about Vioxx\xe2\x80\x99s cardiovascular effects.  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6, 2003.  As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged that Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the naproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.  It said, for example, that Merck \xe2\x80\x9cknew, at least as early as 1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,\xe2\x80\x9d and that a \xe2\x80\x9c1998 internal Merck clinical trial \xe2\x80\xa6 revealed that \xe2\x80\xa6 serious cardiovascular events \xe2\x80\xa6 occurred six times more frequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a different arthritis drug or placebo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 56, 58\xe2\x80\x9359 (emphasis and capitalization deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have known the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d at least two years earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it was filed too late.  The District Court granted the motion.  The court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the (September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck\xe2\x80\x99s (October 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cpossibility </em>that Merck had knowingly misrepresented material facts\xe2\x80\x9d no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing the plaintiffs on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d to look further.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Merck &amp; Co.

Finding that the plaintiffs had failed to \xe2\x80\x9cshow that they exercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were unable to discover their injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d the court took October 9, 2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run and therefore found the complaint untimely.  <em>Id.,</em> at 424.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.  A majority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while constituting \xe2\x80\x9cstorm warnings,\xe2\x80\x9d did not suggest much by way of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring them to investigate further.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Merck &amp; Co.

A dissenting judge considered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the 2-year clock running.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to disagreements among the Courts of Appeals.  Compare<em> Theoharous</em> v. <em>Fong</em>, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limitations period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the need for investigation), with <em>Shah</em> v. <em>Meeker</em>, 435 F.\xc2\xa03d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but if plaintiff <em>does</em> investigate, period runs \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the date such inquiry should have revealed the fraud\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)), and <em>New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund</em> v. <em>Ernst &amp; Young, LLP</em>, 336 F.\xc2\xa03d 495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period <em>always</em> begins to run only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being put on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice,\xe2\x80\x9d should have discovered facts constituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We granted Merck\xe2\x80\x99s petition.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before turning to Merck\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, we consider a more basic matter.  The parties and the Solicitor General agree that \xc2\xa71658(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d refers not only to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s <em>actual </em>discovery of certain facts, but also to the facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered.  We agree.  But because the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language does not make this interpretation obvious, and because we cannot answer the question presented without considering whether the parties are right about this matter, we set forth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that one might read the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cafter the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to the time a plaintiff <em>actually </em>discovered the relevant facts.  But in the statute of limitations context, the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d is often used as a term of art in connection with the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery rule,\xe2\x80\x9d a doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered\xe2\x80\x9d it.  The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to the general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues once a plaintiff has a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</em> v. <em>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/192/index.html">522 U. S. 192</a>, 201 (1997) (citing <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Iowa City</em>, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875); internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court long ago recognized that something different was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even <em>knowing </em>that he or she has been defrauded.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law which was designed to prevent fraud\xe2\x80\x9d could become \xe2\x80\x9cthe means by which it is made successful and secure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>Glover</em>, 21 Wall. 342, 349 (1875).  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is <em>discovered</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holmberg</em> v. <em>Armbrecht</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/392/index.html">327 U. S. 392</a>, 397 (1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  And for more than a century, courts have understood that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa7276b(11), p. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see <em>id.,</em> at 1401\xe2\x80\x931403, and nn. 74\xe2\x80\x9384 (collecting cases and statutes); see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Holmberg, supra, </em>at 397; <em>Kirby</em> v. <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/120/130/index.html">120 U. S. 130</a>, 138 (1887) (The rule \xe2\x80\x9cregard[s] the cause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud was or should have been discovered\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More recently, both state and federal courts have applied forms of the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery rule\xe2\x80\x9d to claims other than fraud.  See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711.1.2.1, 11.1.2.3, pp. 136\xe2\x80\x93142, and nn. 6\xe2\x80\x9313, 18\xe2\x80\x9323 (1991 and 1993 Supp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kubrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/111/index.html">444 U. S. 111</a> (1979).  Legislatures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.  2 Corman<em> </em>\xc2\xa711.2, at 170\xe2\x80\x93171, and nn. 1\xe2\x80\x939 (collecting statutes); see, <em>e.g.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72409a(g) (actions to quiet title against the United States).  In doing so, legislators have written the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d directly into the statute.  And when they have done so, state and federal courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Peacock</em> v. <em>Barnes</em>, 142 N.\xc2\xa0C. 215, 217\xe2\x80\x93220, 55 S.\xc2\xa0E. 99, 100 (1906);<em> Davis</em> v. <em>Hibernia Sav. &amp; Loan Soc.</em>, 21 Cal. App. 444, 448, 132 P. 462, 464 (1913); <em>Roether</em> v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</em>, 51 N.\xc2\xa0D. 634, 640\xe2\x80\x93642, 200 N.\xc2\xa0W. 818, 821 (1924); <em>Goldenberg</em> v. <em>Bache &amp; Co.</em>, 270 F.\xc2\xa02d 675, 681 (CA5 1959); <em>Mobley</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, 202 Mont. 227, 232, 657 P.\xc2\xa02d 604, 606 (1983); <em>Tregenza</em> v. <em>Great American Communications Co.</em>, 12 F.\xc2\xa03d 717, 721\xe2\x80\x93722 (CA7 1993); <em>J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan</em> v. <em>Smith Barney Shearson, Inc.</em>, 76 F.\xc2\xa03d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, treatise writers now describe \xe2\x80\x9cthe discovery rule\xe2\x80\x9d as allowing a claim \xe2\x80\x9cto accrue when the litigant first knows <em>or with due diligence should know</em> facts that will form the basis for an action.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Corman \xc2\xa711.1.1, at 134 (emphasis added); see also <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa01 (collecting cases); 37 Am. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit \xc2\xa7347, p. 354 (2001 and Supp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d all provide that \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to actual knowledge of the fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position that they should have sufficient knowledge or information to have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged with discovery\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 354\xe2\x80\x93355, and nn. 2\xe2\x80\x9311 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended courts to interpret the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) similarly.  Before Congress enacted that statute, this Court, having found in the federal securities laws the existence of an implied private \xc2\xa710(b) action, determined its governing limitations period by looking to other limitations periods in the federal securities laws.  <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow</em> v. <em>Gilbertson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/350/index.html">501 U. S. 350</a> (1991).  Noting the existence of various formulations \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer[ing] slightly in terminology,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court chose the language in 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778i(e), the statutory provision that governs securities price manipulation claims.  501 U. S.<em>, </em>at 364, n.\xc2\xa09.  And in doing so, the Court said that private \xc2\xa710(b) actions \xe2\x80\x9cmust be commenced within one year <em>after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation</em> and within three years after such violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 364<em> </em>(emphasis added).  (The Court listed among the various formulations the one in 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777m, on which the concurrence relies.  See <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <em>Lampf</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 360, and n.\xc2\xa07 (quoting \xc2\xa777m).)  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequently,<em> </em>every Court of Appeals to decide the matter held that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery of the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d occurs not only once a plaintiff <em>actually </em>discovers the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would<em> </em>have discovered them.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Law</em> v. <em>Medco Research, Inc.</em>, 113 F.\xc2\xa03d 781, 785\xe2\x80\x93786 (CA7 1997);<em> Dodds</em> v. <em>Cigna Securities, Inc.</em>, 12 F.\xc2\xa03d 346, 350, 353 (CA2 1993); see <em>In\xc2\xa0re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation</em>, 306 F.\xc2\xa03d 1314, 1325, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).  Some of those courts noted that other limitations provisions in the federal securities laws explicitly<em> </em>provide that the period begins to run \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98after the discovery of the untrue statement \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>or</em> <em>after such discovery should have been made by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence</em>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the formulation adopted by the Court in <em>Lampf</em> from 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778i(e)<em> </em>does not.  <em>Tregenza</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 721 (quoting \xc2\xa777m; emphasis added in <em>Tregenza</em>); see <em>Lampf</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 364, n.\xc2\xa09.  But, courts reasoned, because the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long been understood to include discoveries a reasonably diligent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit provision to that effect did not matter.  <em>Tregenza</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 721; accord, <em>New England Health Care,</em> 336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 499\xe2\x80\x93500.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations statute, it repeated <em>Lampf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s critical language.  The statute says that an action based on fraud \xe2\x80\x9cmay be brought not later than the earlier of \xe2\x80\xa6 2 years <em>after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d </em>(or \xe2\x80\x9c5 years after such violation\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa7804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801, codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(b) (emphasis added).  (This statutory provision does <em>not </em>make the linguistic distinction that the concurrence finds in a <em>different</em> statute, \xc2\xa777m, and upon which its argument rests.  Cf. 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an action be brought \xe2\x80\x9cthree years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had <em>actual knowledge</em> of the breach or violation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).)  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals unanimously have continued to interpret the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in this statute as including not only facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts any reasonably diligent plaintiff would<em> </em>know<em>.</em>  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Staehr</em> v. <em>Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.</em>, 547 F.\xc2\xa03d 406, 411 (CA2 2008); <em>Sudo Properties, Inc.</em> v. <em>Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Govt.</em>, 503 F.\xc2\xa03d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We normally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Lynchburg College</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/106/index.html">535 U. S. 106</a>, 116\xe2\x80\x93117, and n.\xc2\xa013 (2002); <em>Commissioner</em> v. <em>Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/152/index.html">508 U. S. 152</a>, 159 (1993).  Given the history and precedent surrounding the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in the limitations context generally as well as in this provision in particular, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly strong here.  We consequently hold that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d as used in this statute encompasses not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known.  And we evaluate Merck\xe2\x80\x99s claims accordingly.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to Merck\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in favor of holding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims accrued before November 6, 2001. First, Merck argues that the statute does not require \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter-related \xe2\x80\x9cfacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Petitioners 19\xe2\x80\x9328.  We cannot agree, however, that facts about scienter are unnecessary.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute says that the limitations period does not begin to run until \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery of the<em> facts constituting the violation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Scienter is assuredly a \xe2\x80\x9cfact.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a \xc2\xa710(b) action, scienter refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em>, 425 U. S., at 194, n.\xc2\xa012. <em> </em>And the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98state of a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Postal Service Bd. of Governors</em> v. <em>Aikens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/711/index.html">460 U.

Indeed, Congress has enacted special heightened pleading requirements for the scienter element of \xc2\xa710(b) fraud cases.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2) (requiring plaintiffs to \xe2\x80\x9cstate with particularity <em>facts</em> giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  As a result, unless a \xc2\xa710(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the complaint showing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the claim will fail.  See <em>Tellabs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 328.  It would therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule in this provision\xe2\x80\x94which, after all, specifically applies only in cases \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71658(b)\xe2\x80\x94if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discovered any facts suggesting scienter.  So long as a defendant concealed for two years that he made a misstatement with an intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire before the plaintiff had actually \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are among those that \xe2\x80\x9cconstitut[e] the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In so holding, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support a private \xc2\xa710(b) action.  Cf. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12, n.\xc2\xa01 (suggesting that facts concerning a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among those that constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore need not be \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d for a claim to accrue).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Merck argues that, even if \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well.  See Brief for Petitioners 22, 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  But we do not see how that is so.  We recognize that certain statements are such that, to show them false is normally to show scienter as well.  It is unlikely, for example, that someone would falsely say \xe2\x80\x9cI am not married\xe2\x80\x9d without being aware of the fact that his statement is false.  Where \xc2\xa710(b) is at issue, however, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.  An incorrect prediction about a firm\xe2\x80\x99s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell us whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an innocent (and therefore nonactionable) error.   Hence, the statute may require \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter-related facts beyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be materially false or misleading.  Merck fears that this requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions instituted \xe2\x80\x9c5 years after such violation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71658(b)(2), giving defendants total repose after five years, should diminish that fear.  Cf. <em>Lampf</em>, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding comparable bar not subject to equitable tolling).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to run prior to November 2001 because by that point the plaintiffs were on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Merck uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the point \xe2\x80\x9cat which a plaintiff possesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive of wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 20.  And some, but not all, Courts of Appeals have used the term in roughly similar ways.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Franze</em> v. <em>Equitable Assurance</em>, 296 F.\xc2\xa03d 1250, 1254 (CA11 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]nquiry notice [is] \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the term used for knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to begin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had been infringed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>Dodds</em>, 12 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 350 (\xe2\x80\x9cduty of inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d arises once \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she had been defrauded\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.</em> v. <em>Kapoor</em>, 115 F.\xc2\xa03d 1332, 1335\xe2\x80\x931336 (CA7 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe facts constituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 to incite the victim to investigate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto enable him to tie up any loose ends and complete the investigation in time to file a timely suit\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Great Rivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa</em> v. <em>Farmland Industries, Inc.</em>, 120 F.\xc2\xa03d 893, 896 (CA8 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cInquiry notice exists when the victim is aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to investigate <em>and </em>consequently acquire actual knowledge of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the term \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing scienter or other \xe2\x80\x9cfacts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the statute says that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim accrues only after the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of those latter facts.  Nothing in the text suggests that the limitations period can sometimes begin <em>before </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d can take place.  Merck points out that, as we have discussed, see <em>supra, </em>at 8\xe2\x80\x939, the court-created \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery rule\xe2\x80\x9d exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not generally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their claims with reasonable diligence.  But we are dealing here with a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.  Because the statute contains no indication that the limitations period should occur at some earlier moment before \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery,\xe2\x80\x9d when a plaintiff would have <em>begun </em>investigating, we cannot accept Merck\xe2\x80\x99s argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations period does generally begin at \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery,\xe2\x80\x9d it should nonetheless run from the point of \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d in one particular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to undertake an investigation once placed on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual plaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively excuse a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s failure to conduct a further investigation\xe2\x80\x9d by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably diligent plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cin the same position.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same reason we reject \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d as the standard generally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply provides that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d is the event that triggers the 2-year limitations period\xe2\x80\x94for all plaintiffs.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mack</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/480/index.html">295 U. S. 480</a>, 489 (1935) (\xe2\x80\x9cLaches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, the statute does <em>not</em> place all plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cin the same position\xe2\x80\x9d no matter whether they investigate when investigation is warranted.  The limitations period puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d at a disadvantage because it lapses two years after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the necessary facts.  A plaintiff who fails entirely to investigate or delays investigating may well not have discovered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have found sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a \xc2\xa710(b) complaint that satisfies the applicable heightened pleading standards.  Cf. <em>Young</em> v. <em>Lepone</em>, 305 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 9 (CA1 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] reasonably diligent investigation \xe2\x80\xa6 may consume as little as a few days or as much as a few years to get to the bottom of the matter\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Merck further contends that its proposed \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d standard is superior, because determining when a  hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the necessary facts is too complicated for judges to undertake.  But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad circumstances.  And courts in at least five Circuits already ask this kind of question in securities fraud cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rothman</em> v. <em>Gregor</em>, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); <em>New England Health Care,</em> 336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 501; <em>Young, supra,</em> at 1, 9\xe2\x80\x9310; <em>Sterlin</em> v. <em>Biomune Systems</em>, 154 F.\xc2\xa03d 1191, 1201 (CA10 1998); <em>Marks</em> v. <em>CDW Computer Centers, Inc.</em>, 122 F.\xc2\xa03d 363, 367\xe2\x80\x93368 (CA7 1997).  Merck has not shown this precedent to be unworkable.  We consequently find that the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of facts that put a plaintiff on \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d does not automatically begin the running of the limitations period.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the limitations period in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whichever comes first.  In determining the time at which \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d of those \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d occurred, terms such as \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstorm warnings\xe2\x80\x9d may be useful to the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating.  But the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would<em> </em>have discovered \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts constituting the violation,\xe2\x80\x9d including scienter\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal arguments fail, the record still shows that, before November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have discovered \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In respect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s September 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98minimized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the VIGOR study\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98potentially serious cardiovascular findings\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) pleadings filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 alleging that Merck had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98omitted, suppressed, or concealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks associated with Vioxx\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>purposefully </em>downplayed and/or understated the serious nature of the risks associated with Vioxx.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (quoting App. 340, 893).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDA\xe2\x80\x99s warning letter, however, shows little or nothing about the here-relevant scienter, <em>i.e</em>., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent intent.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93A<em>(4)</em>, <em>supra</em>.  The FDA itself described the pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a \xe2\x80\x9cpossible explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to Merck, that Vioxx might be harmful.  App. 340.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The products-liability complaints\xe2\x80\x99 statements about Merck\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge show little more.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93A<em>(3)</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Merck does not claim that these complaints contained any specific information suggesting the fraud alleged here, <em>i.e.</em>, that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis was false even as it promoted it.  And, without providing any reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access to information about Merck\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, the complaints alleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully downplayed and/or understated\xe2\x80\x9d the risks associated with Vioxx\xe2\x80\x94the same charge made in the FDA warning letter.  App. 893.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, neither these two circumstances nor any of the other pre-November 2001 circumstances that we have set forth in Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra, </em>whether viewed separately or together, reveal \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d indicating scienter.  Regardless of which, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001, constituted \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery,\xe2\x80\x9d we need only conclude that prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts constituting the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In light of our interpretation of the statute, our holdings in respect to scienter, and our application of those holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must, and we do, reach that conclusion.  Thus, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 suit is timely.  We need not\xe2\x80\x94and do not\xe2\x80\x94pass upon the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s study might have triggered the statute of limitations.

I agree with the Court that scienter is among the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts constituting the violation\xe2\x80\x9d that a plaintiff must \xe2\x80\x9cdiscove[r]\xe2\x80\x9d for the limitations period to begin.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I also agree that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit is timely, but for a reason different from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s: Merck has not shown that respondents actually \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d scienter more than two years before bringing suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In ordinary usage, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d occurs when one actually learns something new.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[f]inding out or ascertaining something previously unknown or unrecognized\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court notes, however, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, in the context of statutes of limitations \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d has long carried an additional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exercising reasonable diligence, <em>should have</em> discovered the facts giving rise to his claim.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Carpenter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/101/135/index.html">101 U. S. 135</a>, 140\xe2\x80\x93142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of Actions \xc2\xa7276b(11)\xe2\x80\x93(13), pp. 1401\xe2\x80\x931408 (4th ed. 1916); Dawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation, 31 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933).  Read in isolation, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) might mean constructive discovery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In context, however, I do not believe it can.  Section 13 of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly established a constructive-discovery rule for claims under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711 and 12 of that Act: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section 77k or 77<em>l</em>(a)(2) of this title unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777m.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9c[D]iscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa777m obviously cannot mean constructive discovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cor after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>With \xc2\xa777m already on the books, Congress added limitations periods in the 1934 Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778i(e), 78r(c), that did not contain similar qualifying language; instead, each established a time bar that runs from \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d <em>simpliciter</em>.  When Congress enacted \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing a limitations period for private actions for \xe2\x80\x9cfraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery caveat.  To interpret \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) as imposing a constructive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, contrary to common sense, that the same word means two very different things in the same statutory context of limitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, the sensible presumption that a word means the same thing when it appears more than once in the same statutory context\xe2\x80\x94or even in the very same statute\xe2\x80\x94is rebuttable.  See <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cline</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/581/index.html">540 U. S. 581</a>, 595\xe2\x80\x93596 (2004).  Context may make clear that in one instance the word carries one meaning, and in a second instance another.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 596\xe2\x80\x93597.  But nothing in the context of \xc2\xa777m or \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) suggests that is the case.  Both provisions impose limitations periods for federal-law claims based on various false statements or omissions involving securities.  The former applies to false statements or omissions in registration statements, \xc2\xa777k, and offers to sell securities, \xc2\xa777<em>l</em>(a)(2); the broad language of the latter (\xe2\x80\x9cclaim[s] of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws\xe2\x80\x9d) covers other \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulative or deceptive device[s] or contrivance[s]\xe2\x80\x9d made \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the purchase or sale\xe2\x80\x9d of a security in violation of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, \xc2\xa778j(b), including SEC Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935(b) (2009).  There is good reason, moreover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private \xc2\xa710(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive-discovery rule for claims governed by \xc2\xa777m: The elements of \xc2\xa710(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more difficult to discover than the elements of claims under \xc2\xa777k or \xc2\xa777<em>l</em>(a)(2), which do not, see <em>Herman &amp; MacLean</em> v. <em>Huddleston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/375/index.html">459 U. S. 375</a>, 382 (1983); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/index.html">425 U.

And a constructive-discovery standard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by \xc2\xa777m. Determining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an untrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus is much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should have learned that the defendant deliberately misled him using a deceptive device covered by \xc2\xa710(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that warrants giving \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d two meanings, the Court relies on the historical treatment of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in limitations periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporating a constructive-discovery rule.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, 12.  But that history proves only that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d <em>can</em> carry that technical meaning, and that without \xc2\xa777m it would be reasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.  It does not show what \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d means in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) <em>in light of </em>\xc2\xa777m\xe2\x80\x99s codification of a constructive-discovery rule.  In my view, the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in the broader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its meaning in the more specific context of the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s other reason for rejecting the more natural reading of \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the Courts of Appeals before the provision\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.

Congress\xe2\x80\x99s collective intent (if such a thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in any event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent apart from reading the text.

See Brief for Faculty at Law and Business Schools as <em>Amici Curiae </em>23\xe2\x80\x9329 (hereinafter Faculty Brief).  <em>Some</em> circuit cases cited by the Court and <em>amici </em>can conceivably be read as interpreting the language <em>Lampf </em>adopted from \xc2\xa778i(e) as imposing some form of constructive discovery.  See <em>Theoharous </em>v. <em>Fong</em>, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001);<em> Menowitz </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, 991 F.\xc2\xa02d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Haddad</em>, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 328, 329\xe2\x80\x93330 (CA4 1992);<em> Anixter </em>v. <em>Home-Stake Production Co.</em>, 947 F.\xc2\xa02d 897, 898\xe2\x80\x93899 (CA10 1991), vacated on other grounds, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/978/index.html">503 U. S. 978</a> (1992).  Others, however, cannot be so construed.  Two were not interpreting \xc2\xa778i(e) at all, but looked directly to \xc2\xa777m, despite <em>Lampf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explicit selection of \xc2\xa778i(e)\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  <em>Great Rivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa </em>v. <em>Farmland Industries, Inc.</em>, 120 F.\xc2\xa03d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); <em>Topalian </em>v. <em>Ehrman</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992).  Another court candidly acknowledged that \xc2\xa778i(e)\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x94unlike \xc2\xa777m\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonetheless held that courts remain \xe2\x80\x9cfree to apply to [\xc2\xa778i(e)] the judge-made doctrine of inquiry notice\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest and traditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could not have known when it enacted [\xc2\xa778i(e)] that this section would someday provide the statute of limitations for a wide range of securities frauds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tregenza</em> v. <em>Great American Communications Co.</em>, 12 F.\xc2\xa03d 717, 721\xe2\x80\x93722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the issue before \xc2\xa71658(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See <em>Betz </em>v. <em>Trainer Wortham &amp; Co.</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa03d 863, 874 (CA9 2008);<em> New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund</em> v. <em>Ernst &amp; Young, LLP</em>, 336 F.\xc2\xa03d 495, 500\xe2\x80\x93501, and n.\xc2\xa03 (CA6 2003); <em>In\xc2\xa0re NAHC, Inc.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa\xe2\x80\x931).  And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt on a constructive-discovery view in dicta\xe2\x80\x94of which the omniscient Congress of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imagining should also have been aware.  See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Valence Technology, Inc.</em>, 175 F.\xc2\xa03d 699, 703\xe2\x80\x93705 (CA9 1999); <em>Gruber </em>v. <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, 911 F.\xc2\xa02d 960, 964, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA3 1990).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere near establishing that the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa778i(e) meant constructive rather than actual discovery despite \xc2\xa777m.  Absent any textual or contextual reason to read \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d differently in \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) and \xc2\xa777m, I would hold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limitations period for \xc2\xa710(b) claims.  Since Merck points to no evidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter more than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with the Court that the suit was not time barred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, and their <em>amici</em> imply, see Faculty Brief 33\xe2\x80\x9334, that in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any difference between actual and constructive discovery because of the presumption of reliance applicable in such cases, see <em>Basic Inc.</em> v. <em>Levinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/224/index.html">485 U. S. 224</a>, 247 (1988).  It seems to me <em>Basic </em>has no bearing on the question discussed here.  A presumption of reliance upon market-price signals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public information, much less knowledge of nonpublic information that a reasonably diligent investor would have independently uncovered.  In any event, whether or not a constructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield the same result, actual discovery is what \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) requires to start the limitations period.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court appears to believe that \xc2\xa777m\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between actual and constructive discovery has no bearing on \xc2\xa71658(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning because the latter does not itself draw the same distinction.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word (\xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings; and its use in \xc2\xa777m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes are irrelevant, <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, but of course it does not believe that.  Its entire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state legislatures), <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  Yet while the Court considers that broader context, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific context of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court notes that <em>Lampf</em> chose \xc2\xa778i(e)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period as the time bar for \xc2\xa710(b) claims, even though it was aware of \xc2\xa777m, 501 U. S., at 360, and n.\xc2\xa07, 364, and n.\xc2\xa09; see <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But I fail to see how that provides any support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  To the contrary, the fact that in enacting \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) Congress did <em>not</em> copy \xc2\xa777m\xe2\x80\x99s constructive-discovery proviso\xe2\x80\x94but decreed instead that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d alone starts the clock (as it had done in \xc2\xa778i(e), which we borrowed in <em>Lampf</em>)\xe2\x80\x94is what makes equating \xc2\xa777m and \xc2\xa71658(b)(1) so implausible.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
