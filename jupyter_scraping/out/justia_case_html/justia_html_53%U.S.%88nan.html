H. I. Sickles was postmaster at Albion; that he had seen the defendant, and knew him by sight; that he believed he was captain of the packet boat <em>Empire</em> on the Erie Canal in 1845 and part of 1846; that the packet boat <em>Empire,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 53 U. S. 90</a></p><p> during the season of navigation, performed regular trips between Rochester and Buffalo; that Albion was on the canal between Rochester and Buffalo; that he had seen Kelsey, the steward of the boat; that he was steward of the boat while the defendant was captain; that he saw a letter or letters given to Kelsey in 1846, he thought in May; that it was while the defendant was captain and while the boat was at Albion; Kelsey was the steward of the boat, which was going from Buffalo to Rochester; that he thought two letters were given to him, one by Brainard and one by Parmlee; that he did not know as anything else was given to the steward; that he, the witness, was not far off; that he did not know whether both the letters were given to the steward at the same instant of time.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination by the counsel for the defendant, this witness testified that this was between 10 and 11 o\'clock at night; the boat did not stop at Albion over fifteen minutes; that on the occasion spoken of, he and one White got on the boat; that he had seen the defendant on the boat Empire since that time; that he did not abandon the boat very early in 1846; that after the defendant quit, Kelsey run the boat as captain; that he, the witness, was not acquainted with Brainard, who was a tobacco peddler; Parmlee attended the bar at the Mansion House in Albion; the papers handed to the steward were folded in the shape and size of letters; he, the witness, did not know whether they were sealed or not; Kelsey got on the boat after he took the letters; they did not contain over one sheet of paper each.</p>\n<p>On a reexamination by the said United States Attorney, the witness testified that he saw the report of the case by the postmaster to the United States attorney.  It is shown to and identified by the witness, who stated the report to be dated May 7, 1846.</p>\n<p>William V. White was then called as a witness for the said United States, and testified that he resided at Brockport, and was at Albion in the spring of 1846, he thought in May, and stayed at Albion from dark until 10 or 11 o\'clock the same night, and then went from Albion to Rochester in the packet boat <em>Empire,</em> of which the defendant was the captain.</p>\n<p>That the last witness, Sherman, came down to the wharf to see the witness off.  That he, the witness, did not see anything handed to the steward, or any hand on the boat.  That he arrived at Rochester about 7 o\'clock the next morning, and saw Kelsey, the steward, have something of paper which he handed to a boy.  That he did not see the size of the paper or whether sealed or open.  That he did not see from what part of his person the steward took the paper.  That the boy to whom the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 53 U.

That this was almost half an hour after the boat arrived at Rochester.  The said United States Attorney thereupon asked the said witness whether the said steward, when he gave the said papers to the boy, gave any directions to the boy in respect to said papers.  And the said counsel for the said defendant did then and there object and insist that the said question was improper and that the said witness ought not to answer the same.  And the said court did thereupon then and there decide that the said question was incompetent and that the same should not be answered by the witness, to which opinion and decision the said United States attorney did then and there except.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, the said witness testified that he was with Sherman most of the time after nine o\'clock of the evening of the transaction spoken of, until the packet boat left Albion.  That it was between 1 and 15 May, 1846.   That the defendant was on the boat as captain that night.</p>\n<p>James Brainard was then called and sworn as a witness on behalf of the United States, and testified that in May, 1846, he was at work peddling tobacco for Mr. Palmer; that he was at Albion every two weeks, and thought he was there in May; that he was there the fore part of the week, but did not recollect the time of the month; that he recollected offering Kelsey a letter at Albion to carry to Mr. Palmer, his employer, at Rochester, and Kelsey would not carry it, and said he was not permitted to carry letters.  That this was in front of the hotel at Albion, at 10 or 11 o\'clock at night; that he (the witness) kept the letter and wrote an order on his employer for some tobacco and gave it to Kelsey to carry; that he wrote it on a half sheet of paper, and wrote it half over and tore off the residue.  That he folded it over the width of the sheet, and then once at right angles with the first fold, and directed it on the outside to Mr. Palmer, at Rochester.  That the order to Mr. Palmer was a request to send some tobacco to him the witness at Albion by the boat <em>Empire</em> or by the first boat, and the witness thinks the request was to send it by the first boat, and this was the substance of the paper.  That he did not give the steward anything for carrying the letter.  That he received the tobacco the next day.  He found it at the hotel at Albion when he came back from Berne Center.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, this witness testified, that he supposed, when he wrote, that the <em>Empire</em> would be the first boat out of Rochester after the receipt of the order by Palmer.  That he told Palmer to send the tobacco by the first boat; that he paid nothing for bringing the tobacco. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 53 U. S. 92</a></p><p></p>\n<p>James H. Palmer was then called and sworn as a witness on behalf of the United States, and testified that he was the person of that name referred to in the testimony of the last witness, and had charge of the business of the firm at Rochester for whom Brainard was peddling tobacco in May, 1846.  That he frequently received orders from Brainard by mail and otherwise; that the orders were all destroyed; that he never sent tobacco to peddlers except upon orders, unless they requested it before they left Rochester.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, he testified that he recollected sending tobacco by the defendant\'s boat in May, 1846, to Brainard.</p>\n<p>William Parmlee was then sworn, and called as a witness on behalf of the United States and testified that in May, 1846, he attended bar for Mr. Hopkins, at Albion.  That he did not recollect handing any paper or letter to Kelsey to be carried by him or for any other purpose; that he had offered letters to Kelsey to carry, and he refused to carry them; that he recollected seeing Brainard giving a note to Kelsey, written on two-thirds of a sheet of foolscap paper and folded in about the size of an ordinary letter, to be carried to Rochester.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, the witness testified that the boat <em>Empire</em> brought the tobacco from Rochester for Brainard, and he (the witness) paid the steward Kelsey half a dollar for bringing it, which Brainard afterwards repaid him.</p>\n<p>Said Kelsey was then called as a witness for the said United States, and testified that in May, 1846, he was steward of the <em>Empire.</em>  The defendant was captain of the said boat; that he recollected the circumstances spoken of by Brainard and Sherman, that Brainard came with a letter, and he the witness refused to take it, and that he soon afterwards brought the order spoken of, which he the witness took, and, when he arrived at Rochester, sent to Mr. Palmer, and received the tobacco and carried it to Albion, for which be received a half dollar, which was a perquisite of his own.</p>\n<p>The said United States attorney thereupon rested the said cause, and the counsel for the defendant did then and there ask the said judge to direct the said jury that the said evidence did not establish a cause of action against the said defendant and that the said defendant, upon the said evidence, was entitled to a verdict, and the said judge did thereupon then and there declare and decide that the said evidence so as aforesaid given did not establish a cause of action against the said defendant and that the said paper, carried an conveyed by the steward of the said boat from Albion to Rochester as aforesaid described by the witnesses, was not a letter or mailable matter within the meaning of the act of Congress, but was a paper having a different </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 53 U.

To which said opinion and decision the said United States attorney did then and there except, and the said jury did thereupon, in pursuance of the said opinion and decision, without leaving the box, find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p>The cause was afterwards removed by writ of error into the circuit court, when the judgment of the district court was affirmed.</p>\n<p>The United States then sued out writ of error and brought the case up to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 53 U.

That Brainard, one of the witnesses, gave a note to Kelsey, the steward of the boat, written on two-thirds of a sheet of foolscap paper, and folded the size of an ordinary letter, with a direction upon it, to be carried to Rochester.  That the letter was an order to Mr. Palmer for tobacco, which was sent by the return boat, and for which Kelsey, the bearer, received fifty cents.</p>\n<p>The testimony being closed, the defendant prayed the judge to instruct the jury that it did not establish a cause of action against the defendant; and the judge instructed the jury that the paper conveyed by the steward of the boat, Kelsey, from Albion to Rochester, as sworn to by the witnesses was not a letter or mailable matter, within the meaning of the act of Congress, but was a paper having a different and distinct character of its own, and could be lawfully carried by the said steward of the packet boat aforesaid, and did therefore direct the jury to find for the defendant, which they did, and to which instruction the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p>The cause was afterwards removed to the circuit court by writ of error, and by which court the judgment of the district court was affirmed.  This judgment of affirmance is now before us for revision.</p>\n<p>This writ of error was issued under the Act of 31 May, 1844, entitled "An act to amend the Judiciary Act," passed 24 September, 1789, which provides that final judgments in any circuit court of the United States, in any civil action brought by the United States for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United States, or for the collection of the duties due on merchandise imported therein, may be examined, and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, without regard to the sum or value in controversy in such action, at the instance of either party.</p>\n<p>That the act which prescribes the offense charged is a revenue law, there would seem to be no doubt.  In its title, it is declared to be an act to reduce the rates of postage, and for the "prevention </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 53 U. S. 97</a></p><p> of frauds on the revenue of the Post Office Department."  In its character and object it is a revenue law, as it acts upon the rates of postage and increases the revenue by prohibiting and punishing fraudulent acts which lessen it.  Under the act of 1836, the revenue of the Post Office Department is paid into the Treasury.  Revenue is the income of a state, and the revenue of the Post Office Department, being raised by a tax on mailable matter conveyed in the mail, and which is disbursed in the public service, is as much a part of the income of the government as moneys collected for duties on imports.</p>\n<p>We think the instruction of the court was erroneous.  The letter or order, as it is called by some of the witnesses, was folded in the form of a letter and directed as such, though it was not sealed.  A seal was not necessary to constitute it a letter or to make it chargeable with postage.  The letter was not within the exception of the statute, as it did not relate to the cargo or to any article on board of the boat.  It was an order for tobacco on Mr. Palmer, of Rochester, who was a dealer in that article.  Among merchants, an order to the wholesale dealer for merchandise is a common subject of correspondence.  And it may be doubted whether any other subject can be named on which more letters are written and forwarded in the mail.  Two thirds of the half sheet which composed the letter was covered with writing, from which an inference may be drawn that something more than a mere order for goods was requested by the writer.  But an order for goods, folded and directed as a letter, is clearly mailable matter, and a conveyance of it, as charged, is a violation of the law.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the circuit court is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings, according to law.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of New York, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby reversed, and that this cause be and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings to be had therein, according to law.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
