Argued January 20, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 31, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate certain \xe2\x80\x9cnonmineral\xe2\x80\x9d Nevada lands on which settlers could obtain permits to drill for water.  Under \xc2\xa78 of the Pittman Act, each land grant, or patent, reserved to the United States all coal and other \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d in the lands, and the right to remove the same.  When one of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 predecessors-in-interest began extracting sand and gravel from land patented under the Pittman Act, the Bureau of Land Management ruled that he had trespassed against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reserved interest in the property\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner BedRoc Limited, LLC, which subsequently acquired the property and continued to remove the sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior, and petitioner Western Elite, Inc., filed a quiet title action in Federal District Court.  The court granted the Government summary judgment, holding that the contested sand and gravel are \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the United States by the Pittman Act.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">314 F. 3d 1080, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded that sand and gravel are not \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the United States in land grants issued under the Pittman Act.  In construing the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA)\xe2\x80\x94which was identical to the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s except insofar as it reserved to the United States \xe2\x80\x9call the coal and other minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the Pittman Act reserved \xe2\x80\x9c<em>valuable</em> minerals\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this Court determined that neither the dictionary nor the legal understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d prevailing in 1916 was conclusive, but that the SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and history demonstrated that gravel was a \xe2\x80\x9cmineral\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the United States.  <em>Watt</em> v. <em>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/36/index.html">462 U. S. 36</a><em>,</em> 55\xe2\x80\x9360.  This Court will not extend that holding to conclude that sand and gravel are \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals.\xe2\x80\x9d  The <em>Western Nuclear</em> Court had no choice but to speculate about congressional intent with respect to the scope of the amorphous term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals,\xe2\x80\x9d but here Congress has textually narrowed the term\xe2\x80\x99s scope by using the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as the text is unambiguous.  The proper inquiry  in interpreting mineral reservations focuses on the reservation\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning when it was enacted.  <em>Amoco Production Co.</em> v. <em>Southern Ute Tribe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/865/index.html">526 U. S. 865</a>, 874.  Because the Pittman Act applied only to Nevada, the ultimate question is whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s sand and gravel were commonly regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d in 1919.  Common sense says no: They were, and are, abundant throughout Nevada; they have no intrinsic value; and they were commercially worthless in 1919.  Thus, even if they were regarded as minerals, no one would have mistaken them for <em>valuable</em> minerals.  The statutory context of the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation further confirms its ordinary meaning, as Congress explicitly cross-referenced the General Mining Act of 1872, and it is beyond dispute that when the Pittman Act became law, common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable mineral deposit\xe2\x80\x9d under the General Mining Act.  Because the statutory reservation\xe2\x80\x99s text clearly excludes sand and gravel, there is no occasion to resort to legislative history here.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the analogous provision in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA), and that the mineral reservations pursuant to both do not include sand and gravel.  Emphasizing \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pittman Act ignores the fact that the Act uses \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably.  And it implies that the Court erred in <em>Watt</em> v. <em>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/36/index.html">462 U. S. 36</a>, not by interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d too broadly to include sand and gravel, but by interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d too narrowly by reading into the term a requirement that the minerals can be used for commercial purposes.  If \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d were the textual source of a commercial purpose requirement, then the SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s lack of that modifier would imply that the SRHA contains no such requirement.  Because the SRHA and the Pittman Act should be construed similarly, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning with respect to the Pittman Act cannot be confined to that Act and naturally carries over to the SRHA.  If sand and gravel are not included within the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservations because they were not considered \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d at the time the Act was passed, they, with respect to SRHA lands, were not considered to be susceptible of commercial use when Congress passed the SRHA.  Although the <em>Western Nuclear</em> Court incorrectly defined \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d to include sand and gravel, significant reliance interests would be upset if <em>Western Nuclear</em> were overruled.  The Pittman Act, however, involves substantially less land than the SRHA, and the Government does not identify any significant reliance interest that would be unsettled by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s failing to extend <em>Western Nuclear</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.

We hold they are not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beginning with the Homestead Act of 1862, ch. 75, 12 Stat. 392, and stretching into the early 20th century, Congress enacted a series of land-grant statutes aimed at settling the American frontier.  One of these was the Pittman Act.  That Act sought to succeed where earlier homestead laws had failed: promoting development and population growth in the State of Nevada.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 286, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1919).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It was thought that Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s lack of surface water resources was hindering its agricultural progress.  <em>Ibid.</em>  After rejecting various proposals to directly fund exploration for underground water, Congress enacted the Pittman Act to encourage private citizens to prospect for water in Nevada.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevada lies in the heart of the Great Basin, that part of the United States lying roughly between the Sierra Nevada Range on the west and the Wasatch and other mountain ranges on the east.  The western face of the Sierra Nevada blocks rain-bearing winds off the Pacific Ocean from reaching the Great Basin, forming a rain shadow over the entire region.  Nevada has, on the average, less precipitation than any other State in the Union.  This is one reason why most of its rivers, instead of eventually flowing into the sea, disappear into \xe2\x80\x9csinks.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, 442 (15th ed. 1985); Department of Agriculture Yearbook, Climate and Man 987\xe2\x80\x93988 (1941) (cited in <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/110/index.html">463 U. S. 110</a>, 114 (1983)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pittman Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate certain \xe2\x80\x9cnonmineral\xe2\x80\x9d lands[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] in Nevada, on which settlers could obtain permits to drill for water.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x932, 41 Stat. 293\xe2\x80\x93294.  Any settler who could demonstrate successful irrigation of at least 20 acres of crops was eligible for a land grant, or patent, of up to 640 acres.  \xc2\xa75, <em>id.,</em> at 294.  Of central importance here, each patent issued under the Act was required to contain \xe2\x80\x9ca reservation to the United States of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, together with the right to prospect for, mine and remove the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78, <em>id.,</em> at 295.  By virtue of this reservation, the United States was free to dispose of the \xe2\x80\x9ccoal and other valuable mineral deposits in such lands\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pittman Act failed to significantly advance agricultural development in Nevada, S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1282, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1964), and Congress repealed it in 1964,  Pub. L. 88\xe2\x80\x93417, 78 Stat. 389.  The repealing legislation, however, expressly reserved the rights of existing patentees.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two such patentees, Newton and Mabel Butler, were the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners in this case.  In 1940, the Butlers obtained a patent for 560 acres of land in Lincoln County, some 65 miles north of Las Vegas.  As required by the Act, the patent reserved the \xe2\x80\x9ccoal and other valuable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d to the United States.  Common sand and gravel were plentiful and visible on the surface of the Butlers\xe2\x80\x99 land, but there was no commercial market for them due to Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s sparse population and the land\xe2\x80\x99s remote location.  App. 10, 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Earl Williams acquired the Butler property in 1993.  By that time, the expansion of Las Vegas had created a commercial market for the sand and gravel on the land.  Shortly after Williams began extracting the sand and gravel, however, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) served him with trespass notices pursuant to 43 CFR \xc2\xa79239.0\xe2\x80\x937 (1993) (providing that any unauthorized removal of \xe2\x80\x9cmineral materials\xe2\x80\x9d from public lands is \xe2\x80\x9can act of trespass\xe2\x80\x9d).  When Williams challenged the notices, the BLM ruled that by removing sand and gravel Williams had trespassed against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reserved interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d on the property.  The Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed that decision.  <em>Earl Williams</em>, 140 I. B. L. A. 295 (1997).  Meanwhile, petitioner BedRoc Limited, LLC (BedRoc), acquired the Butler property from Williams in 1995.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  BedRoc continued to remove sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior, pending final resolution of the ownership dispute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners filed an action in the United States District Court seeking to quiet title to the sand and gravel on the Butler property.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Government, holding that the contested sand and gravel are \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the United States by the Pittman Act.  50 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1001 (Nev. 1999).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, relying primarily on the legislative history of the Pittman Act and our decision in <em>Watt</em> v. <em>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/36/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/36/index.html">462 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7291 <em>et seq</em>.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe most important \xe2\x80\xa6 land-grant statut[e] enacted in the early 1900\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U. S., at 47.  Unlike the Pittman Act, the SRHA was not limited to Nevada; it applied to any \xe2\x80\x9cpublic lands\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary of the Interior designated as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stock-raising lands.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7291 (1976 ed.) (repealed by Pub. L. 94\xe2\x80\x93579, 90 Stat. 2787).  A person could obtain a patent under the SRHA if he resided on stock-raising lands for three years, <em>ibid.</em>, and \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] permanent improvements upon the land \xe2\x80\xa6 tending to increase the value of the [land] for stock-raising purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7293 (repealed by Pub. L. 94\xe2\x80\x93579, 90 Stat. 2787).  The SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation was identical to the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s in every respect, save one: Whereas the SRHA reserved to the United States \xe2\x80\x9call the coal and other minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7299 (2000 ed.), the Pittman Act reserved \xe2\x80\x9call the coal and other <em>valuable</em> minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78, 41 Stat. 295 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us in <em>Western Nuclear</em> was \xe2\x80\x9cwhether gravel found on lands patented under the [SRHA] is a mineral reserved to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U. S., at 38.  A closely divided Court held that it is.  <em>Id.,</em> at 60.  After determining that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the dictionary nor the legal understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x98minerals\xe2\x80\x99 that prevailed in 1916 sheds much light on the question before us,\xe2\x80\x9d we turned to the purpose and history of the SRHA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  We observed that the SRHA, like other land-grant Acts containing mineral reservations, sought to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate development of both surface and subsurface resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9352.  We therefore reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe determination of whether a particular substance is included in the surface estate or the mineral estate should be made in light of the use of the surface estate that Congress contemplated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 52.  Accordingly, we interpreted the SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation to include \xe2\x80\x9csubstances that are mineral in character (<em>i.e.</em>, that are inorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be included in the surface estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 53.  Because we thought it unlikely that Congress would have made the exploitation of gravel deposits dependent on farmers and ranchers \xe2\x80\x9cwhose interests were known to lie elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d and because gravel met our other criteria, we concluded that it is indeed a \xe2\x80\x9cmineral\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the United States.  <em>Id</em>., at 55\xe2\x80\x9360.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that our rationale in <em>Western Nuclear</em> compels the outcome in this case, notwithstanding the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly narrower reservation of \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d minerals.  Petitioners, for their part, argue that <em>Western Nuclear </em>should be distinguished on this ground or, in the alternative, overruled altogether.  While we share the concerns expressed in the <em>Western Nuclear</em> dissent, see n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra,</em> we decline to overrule our recent precedent.  By the same token, we will not extend <em>Western Nuclear</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding to conclude that sand and gravel are \xe2\x80\x9c<em>valuable</em> minerals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever the correctness of <em>Western Nuclear</em>\xe2\x80\x99s broad construction of the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals,\xe2\x80\x9d we are not free to so expansively interpret the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s reservation.  In <em>Western Nuclear</em>, we had no choice but to speculate about congressional intent with respect to the scope of the amorphous term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, by contrast, Congress has textually narrowed the scope of the term by using the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to \xe2\x80\x9cpresume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connecticut Nat.

Thus, our inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, 540 U.

We think the term \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d makes clear that Congress did not intend to include sand and gravel in the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn interpreting statutory mineral reservations like the one at issue here, we have emphasized that Congress \xe2\x80\x98was dealing with a practical subject in a practical way\xe2\x80\x99 and that it intended the terms of the reservation to be understood in \xe2\x80\x98their ordinary and popular sense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Amoco Production Co.</em> v. <em>Southern Ute Tribe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/865/index.html">526 U.

Because the Pittman Act applied only to Nevada, the ultimate question is whether the sand and gravel found in Nevada were commonly regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d in 1919.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common sense tells us, and the Government does not contest, that the answer to that question is an emphatic \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sand and gravel were, and are, abundant throughout Nevada; they have no intrinsic value; and they were commercially worthless in 1919 due to Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s sparse population and lack of development.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Thus, even if Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s sand and gravel were regarded as minerals, no one would have mistaken them for <em>valuable</em> minerals.  The Government argues only that sand and gravel were commercially marketable in other parts of the United States during World War I and that there is now a market for sand and gravel in some parts of Nevada.  As we have explained, this evidence is simply irrelevant to the proper inquiry into the meaning of the statutory mineral reservation.  Cf.<em> Amoco Production Co.</em>, 526 U. S., at 873\xe2\x80\x93880 (relying on the popular meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccoal\xe2\x80\x9d in 1909 and 1910 to hold that a reservation of \xe2\x80\x9ccoal\xe2\x80\x9d does not include coalbed methane gas).  Because we readily conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cmost natural interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the mineral reservation does not encompass sand and gravel, we \xe2\x80\x9cneed not consider the applicability of the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 880.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory context of the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation further confirms its ordinary meaning.  The sentence directly following the reservation provides that the reserved \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable mineral deposits \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be subject to disposal by the United States in accordance with the provisions of the \xe2\x80\xa6 mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78, 41 Stat. 295.  Here, Congress was explicitly cross-referencing the General Mining Act of 1872, currently codified at Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa72319, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa722.  Then, as now, the General Mining Act provided that \xe2\x80\x9call valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be free and open to exploration and purchase \xe2\x80\xa6 under regulations prescribed by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We can therefore infer that the reserved \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d in Pittman Act lands were the same class of minerals that could be located and disposed of under the Gen-\neral Mining Act.  Cf. <em>Western Nuclear, </em>462<em> </em>U. S., at 59\n(drawing same inference from nearly identical mineral reservation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is beyond dispute that when the Pittman Act became law in 1919, common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable mineral deposit\xe2\x80\x9d under the General Mining Act.  The Secretary of the Interior had held as much in <em>Zimmerman</em> v. <em>Brunson</em>, 39 L.\xc2\xa0D. 310 (1910), see <em>Western Nuclear</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 45 (discussing <em>Zimmerman</em>); 462 U. S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9365 (Powell, J., dissenting) (same), and this remained the Department\xe2\x80\x99s position until 1929, when it overruled <em>Zimmerman</em> in <em>Layman</em> v. <em>Ellis</em>, 52 L.\xc2\xa0D. 714,  see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Western Nuclear, supra,</em> at 65\xe2\x80\x9369 (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>Robert L. Beery</em>, 83 I.\xc2\xa0D. 249, 253 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cPrior to 1929 sand and gravel were not considered locatable under the general mining law\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Thus, in the unlikely event that some ambitious prospector had sought a patent from the United States in 1919 to extract sand and gravel from Pittman Act lands, the Secretary of the Interior would have flatly refused him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government is correct that the <em>Western Nuclear </em>Court sidestepped the impact of this line of reasoning by relying on the ambiguity of the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d and the possibility that Congress was not aware of Interior\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Zimmerman</em> decision, see 462 U. S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9347.  But we decline to extend that approach beyond the SRHA.  In our analysis, the statutory structure of the Pittman Act convincingly reinforces the unambiguous meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the contemporaneous plain meaning of the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation, the Government argues that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history counsels us to give \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d precisely the same meaning we ascribed to \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Western Nuclear</em>.  Because we have held that the text of the statutory reservation clearly excludes sand and gravel, we have no occasion to resort to legislative history.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lamie</em>, 540 U.

We thus cannot accept Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to presume that Congress expressed itself in a single House Committee Report rather than in the unambiguous statutory text approved by both Houses and signed by the President.

As Justice Stevens points out, the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pittman Act provision is only twice modified by the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[s] that the terms \xe2\x80\x99valuable minerals\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98minerals\xe2\x80\x99 were intended to be synonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (dissenting opinion).

S. 36</a> (1983), the plurality relies heavily on the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals,\xe2\x80\x9d contrasting this with the SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals.\xe2\x80\x9d  This difference, the plurality holds, makes the scope of the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservation provision both more clear and more narrow than that of the SRHA.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Placing so much emphasis on the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pittman Act, however, ignores the fact that the Act uses the terms \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably.  It also implies that the Court erred in <em>Western Nuclear</em>, not by interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d too broadly to include sand and gravel (as the plurality suggests here, see <em>ante</em>, at 6), but by interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d too narrowly by reading into the term a requirement that the minerals can be used for commercial purposes.*<footcall num="*">  If the word \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable\xe2\x80\x9d were the textual source of a commercial purpose requirement, then the SRHA\xe2\x80\x99s lack of that modifier would strongly imply that the SRHA contains no commercial purpose requirement.  Because the Court in <em>Western Nuclear</em> properly interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d to contain a commercial purpose requirement, I would not put so much emphasis on the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable.\xe2\x80\x9d</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree, however, with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in <em>Western Nuclear</em> that sand and gravel are \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d under the SRHA merely because, hypothetically, at the time of the passage of the SRHA, they <em>could</em> have been used for commercial purposes, 462 U. S., at 55.  Because the SRHA and the Pittman Act should be construed similarly, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning with respect to the Pittman Act cannot be confined to that Act and naturally carries over to the SRHA.  As the plurality points out, both common sense and the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory context\xe2\x80\x9d of the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment confirm the view that sand and gravel are not included within the Pittman Act\xe2\x80\x99s mineral reservations, since sand and gravel were not understood to be \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable minerals\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the passage of the Act.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  Likewise, sand and gravel, with respect to SRHA lands, were not considered to be susceptible of commercial use at the time Congress passed the SRHA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court in <em>Western Nuclear</em> incorrectly applied its definition of \xe2\x80\x9cminerals\xe2\x80\x9d to include sand and gravel, the Court is typically reluctant to overrule decisions involving statute interpretation because \xe2\x80\x9c<em>stare decisis </em>concerns are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Khan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/3/index.html">522 U.

The Pittman Act, however, involves substantially less land than the SRHA, and the Government does not identify any significant reliance interests that would be unsettled by our failing to extend <em>Western Nuclear\xe2\x80\x99</em>s reasoning.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and decline to extend <em>Western Nuclear</em>\xe2\x80\x99s faulty reasoning beyond the SRHA.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Court in <em>Western Nuclear</em> at times suggested an even narrower definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmineral,\xe2\x80\x9d stating that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress plainly contemplated that mineral deposits on SRHA lands would be subject to location under the mining laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U.

R. Rep. No. 286, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1919).  Today the Court decides that the reservation of minerals in \xc2\xa78 of the Pittman Act does not include gravel.  I think it highly unlikely that Congress would reserve its ownership of sand and gravel in the millions of acres of land in the West that were covered by the SRHA and not do so for the land in Nevada covered by the Pittman Act.  Indeed, the House Committee Report describing the scope of the mineral reservation in \xc2\xa78 of the Pittman Act plainly states: \xe2\x80\x9cSection 8 of the bill contains the same reservations of minerals, with the facility for prospecting for and developing and mining such minerals as was provided in the [SRHA].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

As Justice Aharon Barak of the Israel Supreme Court perceptively has explained, the \xe2\x80\x9cminimalist\xe2\x80\x9d judge \xe2\x80\x9cwho holds that the purpose of the statute may be learned only from its language\xe2\x80\x9d retains greater discretion than the judge who \xe2\x80\x9cwill seek guidance from every reliable source.\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial Discretion 62 (Y. Kaufmann transl. 1989).  A method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, increases the risk that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s own policy preferences will affect the decisional process.  The policy choice at issue in this case is surely one that should be made either by Congress itself or by the executive agency administering the Pittman Act.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 acceptance of the holding in <em>Western Nuclear</em> for the past two decades should control our decision, and any residual doubt should be eliminated by the deference owed to the executive agency that has consistently construed the mineral reservations in land grant statutes as including sand and gravel.

S., at 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (citing rulings of the Department of the Interior).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGiven Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that the surface of SRHA lands would be used for ranching and farming, we interpret the mineral reservation in the Act to include substances that are mineral in character (<em>i.e.</em>, that are inorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be included in the surface estate.  See 1 American Law of Mining \xc2\xa73.26 [(1982)] (\xe2\x80\x98A reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the surface all mineral substances which can be taken from the soil and which have a separate value\xe2\x80\x99).  Cf. <em>Northern Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Soderberg</em>, 188 U. S. [526, 536\xe2\x80\x93537 (1903)] (\xe2\x80\x98mineral lands include not merely metalliferous lands, but all such as are chiefly valuable for their deposits of a mineral character, which are useful in the arts or valuable for purposes of manufacture\xe2\x80\x99); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Isbell Construction Co., </em>[78 I.\xc2\xa0D. 385, 390 (1971)] (\xe2\x80\x98the reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the surface all mineral substances <em>which can be taken from the soil and have a separate value</em>\xe2\x80\x99) (emphasis in original).  This interpretation of the mineral reservation best serves the congressional purpose of encouraging the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources, for ranching and farming do not ordinarily entail the extraction of mineral substances that can be taken from the soil and that have separate value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Western Nuclear, </em>462 U.
