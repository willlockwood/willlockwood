A plan reapportioning the South Carolina Senate, enacted into law on May 6, 1972, and filed with the District Court for the District of South Carolina, which had invalidated a previous plan in a consolidated action challenging its constitutionality, was submitted to the Attorney General on May 12 for preclearance review under \xc2\xa7 5.  On May 23, the District Court found the new plan constitutional, and on June 30, the Attorney General notified South Carolina that he would interpose no objection, but would defer to the court\'s determination.  Thereafter, another suit was brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Attorney General\'s failure to object to the new plan, and, in response to that court\'s order of May 16, 1973, to make a reasoned determination as to the constitutionality of the new plan, the Attorney General stated that, in his view, it was unconstitutional, but that he still refused to interpose an objection in deference to the ruling of the District Court for the District of South Carolina.  However, on July 19, 1973, the District Court for the District of Columbia directed the Attorney General to consider the new plan without regard to the other District Court\'s decision, and, the next day, the Attorney General interposed an objection to the plan.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, holding that the Attorney General\'s initial failure to interpose an objection was reviewable, and that \xc2\xa7 5 required him to make an independent determination on the merits of the \xc2\xa7 5 issues.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case concerns the scope of judicial review of the Attorney General\'s failure to interpose a timely objection under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to a change in the voting laws of a jurisdiction subject to that Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The events leading up to this litigation date back to November 11, 1971, when South Carolina enacted Act 932 reapportioning the State Senate. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  South Carolina promptly submitted Act 932 to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance review pursuant to \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 432 U. S. 494</a></p><p> Rights Act.  79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973c (1970 ed. Supp. V). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That section forbids States subject to the Act to implement any change in "any voting qualification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 432 U. S. 495</a></p><p> or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" without first (i) obtaining a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia that the proposed change "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color," or (ii) submitting the change to the Attorney General and receiving no objection within 60 days. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  While the Attorney General had Act 932 under review, several suits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina challenging that Act as violative of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and seeking to enjoin its enforcement until preclearance had been obtained under \xc2\xa7 5.  The cases were consolidated, and a three-judge District Court was convened.</p>\n<p>On March 6, 1972, the Attorney General interposed an objection to Act 932. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Although the South Carolina District Court as aware of this objection -- an objection that, standing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 432 U. S. 496</a></p><p> alone, would have justified an injunction against enforcement of the Act -- the court proceeded to address the constitutional validity of the reapportionment plan. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  That court rejected the Fifteenth Amendment claim for lack of evidence that Act 932 was racially motivated, but held that the Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment due to malapportionment.  The court retained jurisdiction and allowed South Carolina 30 days to enact an acceptable substitute reapportionment plan.  <em>Twiggs v. West,</em> Civ. No. 71-1106 (SC, Apr. 7, 1972).</p>\n<p>On May 6, 1972, a new senate reapportionment plan was enacted into law as \xc2\xa7 2 of Act 1205. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This new plan was filed with the District Court, and it was submitted to the Attorney General on May 12 for preclearance review.  On May 23, the District Court found the plan constitutional. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  By letter dated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 432 U. S. 497</a></p><p> June 30, the Attorney General notified South Carolina that he would not interpose an objection to the new plan because he felt "constrained to defer to the . . . determination of the three-judge District Court" in <em>Twiggs v. West, supra.</em> [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  App. 48.  Thus, as of June 30, 1972, \xc2\xa7 2 of Act 1205 had been declared constitutional by a three-judge District Court, and the Attorney General had declined to interpose an objection under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Not content with the Attorney General\'s decision to defer to the judicial determination of the three-judge District Court, several of the named plaintiffs in the consolidated <em>Twiggs</em> action commenced another suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on August 10, 1972, in which they challenged the Attorney General\'s failure to object to the new senate reapportionment plan.  On May 16, 1973, that court ordered the Attorney General to make "a reasoned decision in accordance with his statutory responsibility."  <em>Harper v. Kleindienst,</em> 362 F.Supp. 742, 746 (1973).  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 432 U. S. 498</a></p><p> response to this order, the Attorney General stated that, in his view, the plan violated the Fifteenth Amendment, but he reaffirmed his refusal to interpose an objection on the ground that he was constrained to defer to the ruling of the District Court in <em>Twiggs v. West.</em>  App. to Brief for Appellants 4a.  On July 19, 1973, the District of Columbia District Court directed the Attorney General to consider Act 1205 without regard to the decision in <em>Twiggs v. West.</em>  The next day, the Attorney General interposed an objection because he was "unable to conclude that Act No. 1205 does not have the effect of abridging voting rights on account of race."  App. 52.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.  It held that the Attorney General\'s decision not to interpose an objection was reviewable under the circumstances of this case, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and that \xc2\xa7 5 requires him to make an independent determination on the merits of \xc2\xa7 5 issues.  <em>Harper v. Levi,</em> 171 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 520 F.2d 53 (1975).</p>\n<p>Armed with the decision of the Court of Appeals and the belated objection interposed by the Attorney General, two South Carolina voters filed the present suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina as a class action under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  <em>See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html">393 U. S. 544</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html#557">393 U. S. 557</a></span>-563 (1969).  The plaintiffs, appellants here, sought an injunction against implementation of \xc2\xa7 2 of Act 1205 on the ground that the Attorney General had interposed an objection and the State had not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 432 U. S. 499</a></p><p> subsequently obtained a favorable declaratory judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The three-judge District Court convened under \xc2\xa7 5 dismissed the complaint.  425 F.Supp. 331 (1976).  It held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not preclude it from considering South Carolina\'s contention that, notwithstanding the decision in <em>Harper v. Levi, supra,</em> the requirements of \xc2\xa7 5 were satisfied when the Attorney General failed to interpose an objection within 60 days after submission to him of Act 1205. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The District Court also ruled that the Administrative Procedure Act did not authorize judicial review of the Attorney General\'s initial determination to defer to the ruling of the three-judge District Court in <em>Twiggs v. West.</em>  In light of these considerations, the District Court concluded that the failure of the Attorney General to interpose an objection within the applicable 60-day period left South Carolina free to implement the new senate reapportionment plan.</p>\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction to determine the reviewability of the Attorney General\'s failure to interpose a timely objection under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  429 U.S. 997 (1976).  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The ultimate issue in this case concerns the implementation of South Carolina\'s reapportionment plan for the State Senate.  Since that plan has not been declared by the District Court for the District of Columbia to be without racially discriminatory purpose or effect, it can be implemented only if the Attorney General "has not interposed an objection" to the plan within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  It </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 432 U. S. 500</a></p><p> conceded that no objection was entered within the 60-day period.  425 F.Supp. at 333.  But appellants insist that the Attorney General\'s <em>nunc pro tunc</em> objection of July 20, 1973, is effective under the Act, and thus bars implementation of the reapportionment plan.  Since that objection was interposed pursuant to the District Court\'s order in <em>Harper v. Kleindienst,</em> its validity depends on whether the <em>Harper</em> court had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the Attorney General\'s failure to object. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Administrative Procedure Act stipulates that the provisions of that Act authorizing judicial review apply "except to the extent that --(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 432 U. S. 501</a></p><p> 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701(a). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  It is now well settled that</p>\n<p>"judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html">387 U.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The reviewing court must determine whether</p>\n<p>"Congress has in express or implied terms precluded judicial review or committed the challenged action entirely to administrative discretion."</p>\n<p><em>Barlow v.

S. 165</a></span> (1970).</p>\n<p>As no provision of the Voting Rights Act expressly precludes judicial review of the Attorney General\'s actions under \xc2\xa7 5, it is necessary to determine "whether nonreviewability can fairly be inferred."  397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/159/case.html#166">397 U.

That inquiry must address the role played by the Attorney General within "the context of the entire legislative scheme."  <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html#141">387 U. S. 141</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The nature of the \xc2\xa7 5 remedy, which this Court has characterized as an "unusual" and "severe" procedure, <em>Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html">393 U. S. 544</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html#556">393 U. S. 556</a></span> (1969), strongly suggests that Congress did not intend the Attorney General\'s actions under that provision to be subject to judicial review.  Section 5 requires covered jurisdictions to delay implementation of validly enacted state legislation until federal authorities have had an opportunity to determine whether that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 432 U. S. 502</a></p><p> legislation conforms to the Constitution and to the provisions of the Voting Rights Act.  <em>See South Carolina v. Katzenbach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html">383 U. S. 301</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html#334">383 U. S. 334</a></span> (1966).  Section 5 establishes two alternative methods by which covered jurisdictions can comply with this severe requirement of federal preclearance review.  First, a covered jurisdiction may file a declaratory judgment action in the District Court for the District of Columbia and subsequently may implement the change in voting laws if that court declares that the change "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973c (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Second, a covered jurisdiction may submit a change in voting laws to the Attorney General and subsequently may enforce the change if "the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>According to the terms of \xc2\xa7 5, a covered jurisdiction is in compliance pursuant to the latter alternative once it has (i) filed a complete submission with the Attorney General, and (ii) received no objection from that office within 60 days.  This second method of compliance under \xc2\xa7 5 is unlike the first in that implementation of changes in voting laws is not conditioned on an affirmative statement by the Attorney General that the change is without discriminatory purpose or effect.

Section 8 of the original bill provided for preclearance review only by means of a declaratory judgment action in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Hearings on S. 1564 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965) (hereafter Senate Hearings).  Justified concerns arose that the time required to pursue such litigation would unduly delay the implementation of validly enacted, nondiscriminatory state legislation.  Cognizant of the problem, Attorney General Katzenbach suggested that the declaratory judgment procedure "could be improved by applying it only to those laws which the Attorney General takes exception to within a given period of time."  Senate Hearings 237.  The legislation was changed to incorporate this suggestion. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 432 U. S. 504</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In light of the potential severity of the \xc2\xa7 5 remedy, the statutory language, and the legislative history, we think it clear that Congress intended to provide covered jurisdictions with an expeditious alternative to declaratory judgment actions.  The congressional intent is plain:  the extraordinary remedy of postponing the implementation of validly enacted state legislation was to come to an end when the Attorney General failed to interpose a timely objection based on a complete submission. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Although there was to be no bar to subsequent constitutional challenges to the implemented legislation, there also was to be "no dragging out" of the extraordinary federal remedy beyond the period specified in the statute.  <em>Switchmen v.

Since judicial review of the Attorney General\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 432 U. S. 505</a></p><p> actions would.unavoidably extend this period, it is necessarily precluded. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Our conclusions in this respect are reinforced by the fact that the Attorney General\'s failure to object is not conclusive with respect to the constitutionality of the submitted state legislation. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The statute expressly provides that neither</p>\n<p>"an affirmative indication by the Attorney General that no objection will be made, nor the Attorney General\'s failure to object . . . shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement"</p>\n<p>of the newly enacted legislation or voting regulation.  <em>Cf.

Bachowski,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/560/case.html">421 U. S. 560</a></span> (1975), the case cited by the dissent, illustrates the point.  In that case, the Court did not confront anything analogous to the potential severity of the \xc2\xa7 5 remedy at issue here  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#504">432 U. S. 504</a></span>.  Moreover, the statute at issue in <em>Dunlop</em> provided that suit by the Secretary of Labor would be the exclusive post-election remedy.  In the instant case, on the other hand, objection by the Attorney General is not the exclusive method of challenging changes in a State\'s voting laws, since the Attorney General\'s failure to object is not conclusive with respect to the constitutionality of submitted state legislation.  <em>See infra</em> this page.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, an objection on the part of the Attorney General is not conclusive with respect to the invalidity of the submitted state legislation under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.  After receiving an objection from the Attorney General, a covered jurisdiction retains the option of seeking a favorable declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia.  <em>See Beer v. United States, supra; City of Petersburg v.

JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s dissent would formulate a new mechanical rule of statutory construction:  if one section of a statute expressly forbids judicial review, it would not be open for the courts to inquire whether Congress also intended to preclude review under other sections of the same statute.  Application of such a rule of statutory construction would prevent a court from giving effect to congressional intent that otherwise was clear from "the context of the entire legislative scheme."  <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html#141">387 U. S. 141</a></span>.  The existence of an express preclusion of judicial review in one section of a statute is a factor relevant to congressional intent, but it is not conclusive with respect to reviewability under other sections of the statute.  Here, we simply conclude that other factors -- the harsh nature of the \xc2\xa7 5 remedy, the statutory language, and the legislative materials -- are sufficiently strong indications of congressional intent to override any contrary inference that might be drawn from the fact that Congress expressly precluded judicial review in a different section of the same statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s dissent opens with a "floodgates" argument:  if there is no judicial review when the Attorney General misunderstands his legal duty, there also will be no judicial review when, at sometime in the future, the Attorney General bargains acquiescence in a discriminatory change in a covered State\'s voting laws in return for that State\'s electoral votes.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#508">432 U. S. 508</a></span>, and n. 1.  That "floodgates" concern is equally applicable to Congress\' express preclusion of judicial review under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Act, <em>see</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22, <em>supra,</em> a fact which suggests that Congress -- like the courts -- operates on the assumption that the Attorney General of the United States will perform faithfully his statutory responsibilities.  In determining whether preclusion of judicial review can fairly be inferred from the context of the entire legislative scheme, we place no weight on the prospect that an Attorney General someday will trade electoral votes for preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States suggests that there should be limited judicial review only when the Attorney General improperly relinquishes his responsibility to evaluate independently the submitted legislation in light of the standards established by \xc2\xa7 5.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 30-31.  For the reasons stated in text, we think Congress intended to preclude all judicial review of the Attorney General\'s exercise of discretion or failure to act.  We note, however, that there is no evidence in this case that the Attorney General improperly "relinquished" his statutory responsibilities.  The record is clear that the Attorney General reviewed the submitted legislation as well as the judicial determination in <em>Twiggs v. West,</em> and decided not to interpose an objection to \xc2\xa7 2 of Act 1205.  That decision may have been erroneous, <em>see</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra,</em> but it nonetheless was a decision exercised pursuant to the Attorney General\'s \xc2\xa7 5 responsibilities.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of this disposition of the case, we find it unnecessary to address the argument advanced by South Carolina that the single judge in <em>Harper v. Kleindienst,</em> 362 F.Supp. 742 (DC 1973), had no jurisdiction to determine questions arising under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  <em>See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,</em> 393 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/case.html#560">393 U. S. 560</a></span>-563.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds today that an Attorney General\'s failure to object within 60 days to the implementation of a voting law that has been submitted to him under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 432 U. S. 508</a></p><p> Rights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973c (1970 ed., Supp. V), cannot be questioned in any court.  Under the Court\'s ruling, it matters not whether the Attorney General fails to object because he misunderstands his legal duty, as in this case; because he loses the submission; or because he seeks to subvert the Voting Rights Act.  Indeed, the Court today grants unreviewable discretion to a future Attorney General to bargain acquiescence in a discriminatory change in a covered State\'s voting laws in return for that State\'s electoral votes. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  <em>Cf.</em> J. Randall &amp; D. Donald, The Civil War and Reconstruction 678-701 (2d ed.1961) (settlement of the election of 1876).</p>\n<p>Common sense proclaims the error of this result.  It is simply implausible that Congress, which devoted unusual attention to this Act in recognition of its stringency and importance, <em>see South Carolina v. Katzenbach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html">383 U. S. 301</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html#308">383 U.

S. 509</a></p><p> mechanism to be vitiated at the whim of an Attorney General.  Legal analysis supports the conclusion that Congress did no such thing.  But today, the majority puts aside both common sense and legal analysis, relying instead on fiat.  I dissent.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the dispositive issue in this case is whether Congress has precluded all judicial review of the Attorney General\'s failure to enter an objection to implementation of a state statute submitted to him for review under \xc2\xa7 5. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  And, as the majority notes, it is indeed</p>\n<p>"well settled that \'judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#501">432 U. S. 501</a></span>, quoting <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html">387 U. S. 136</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html#140">387 U. S. 140</a></span> (1967).  If the Court applied, rather than merely acknowledged, this standard, the judgment below would be reversed.</p>\n<p>The Voting Rights Act does not explicitly preclude review of the Attorney General\'s actions under \xc2\xa7 5.  The absence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 432 U. S. 510</a></p><p> of such a provision places on appellees</p>\n<p>"the heavy burden of overcoming the strong presumption that Congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review of [the Attorney General\'s] decision[s]."</p>\n<p><em>Dunlop v. Bachowski,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/560/case.html">421 U. S. 560</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/560/case.html#567">421 U. S. 567</a></span> (1975).  The normal "strong" presumption is strengthened still further in this case by the express prohibition, contained in \xc2\xa7 4(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973b(b), of judicial review of the Attorney General\'s determinations under that section as to which States are covered by the Act. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  If the Congress that wrote \xc2\xa7 4 had also intended to preclude review of the same officer\'s actions under \xc2\xa7 5, it would certainly have said so.  The Court makes no effort to explain why the congressional silence in \xc2\xa7 5 should be treated as the equivalent of the congressional statement in \xc2\xa7 4.</p>\n<p>Not only is there nothing in \xc2\xa7 5 precluding review, there is also, as the Court admits, "no legislative history bearing directly on the issue of reviewability of the Attorney General\'s actions under \xc2\xa7 5."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#503">432 U. S. 503</a></span>.  Thus, all the Court offers in support of its conclusion that the strengthened presumption of reviewability should be disregarded in this case is an inference that review must be foreclosed to serve the assertedly primary congressional purpose of limiting the time during which covered States are prevented from implementing new legislation.  That inference is purportedly drawn from an inquiry into "the role played by the Attorney General within <em>the context of the entire legislative scheme.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#501">432 U.

In fact, however, the Court completely ignores the Attorney General; the majority\'s version of \xc2\xa7 5 requires a covered State to submit its statutes to a mailing address at the Department of Justice and to wait for 60 days before implementing </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 432 U. S. 511</a></em></p><p><em> the submitted laws, but it does not impose any duties on the Attorney General.  The time limit on the Attorney General\'s action, and not any requirement that he review submitted laws for compliance with the Voting Rights Act is, according to the Court, the key aspect of the part of \xc2\xa7 5 with which we are concerned.\n</em></p>\n<p>We have previously taken a much different view of \xc2\xa7 5.  Just four years ago, in <em>Georgia v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html">411 U. S. 526</a></span> (1973), we were required to consider the Attorney General\'s role in \xc2\xa7 5.  We recognized that, in doing so,</p>\n<p>"it is important to focus on the entire scheme of \xc2\xa7 5.  That portion of the Voting Rights Act essentially freezes the election laws of the covered States unless a declaratory judgment is obtained in the District Court for the District of Columbia holding that a proposed change is without discriminatory purpose or effect.  The alternative procedure of submission to the Attorney General \'<em>merely</em> gives the covered State a rapid method of rendering a new state election law enforceable.\'  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/393/544/case.html">Allen v. State Board of Elections,</a></span></em> 393 U.S. [544,]  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/393/544/case.html#549">393 U.

Because the provision for submission to the Attorney General was meant only to ameliorate, and not to change, the "essential" burden of \xc2\xa7 5, we upheld regulations that deferred the beginning of the 60-day review period created by the Act until a submission satisfied certain criteria.  We noted that "[t]he judgment that the Attorney General <em>must</em> make is a difficult and complex one," 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html#540">411 U. S. 540</a></span> (emphasis added), and that, if he could not await complete information, "his only plausible response to an inadequate or incomplete submission would be simply to object to it." [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  We also upheld </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 432 U. S. 512</a></p><p> the Attorney General\'s placement of the burden of proof on States submitting legislation for approval, because</p>\n<p>"[a]ny less stringent standard might well have rendered the formal declaratory judgment procedure a dead letter by making available to covered States a far smoother path to clearance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html#538">411 U. S. 538</a></span>.  In contrast to today\'s ruling, we held that providing such a path was not the function of the proviso to \xc2\xa7 5 which established clearance by the Attorney General as an alternative to the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p>Our description in <em>Georgia v. United States</em> of the very limited function of the proviso supports the conclusion that the Attorney General should respond to a submitted statute as would the District Court for the District of Columbia if the State brought a declaratory judgment action seeking approval of that statute.  The regulation approved by the Court in <em>Georgia v. United States</em> explicitly imposes that obligation on the Attorney General.  28 CFR \xc2\xa7 51.19 (1976). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Moreover, the regulation also specifies the actions the Attorney General must take:</p>\n<p>"If the Attorney General is satisfied that the submitted change does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect, he will not object to the change, and will so notify the submitting authority.  If the Attorney General </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 432 U. S. 513</a></p><p> determines that the submitted change has a racially discriminatory purpose or effect, he will enter an objection and will so notify the submitting authority.  If the evidence as to the purpose or effect of the change is conflicting, and the Attorney General is unable to resolve the conflict within the 60-day period, he shall, consistent with the above-described burden of proof [on the State] applicable in the District Court, enter an objection and so notify the submitting authority."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  This validly adopted regulation, which clearly requires the Attorney General to enter an objection unless he determines the submitted legislation has neither the proscribed purpose nor the forbidden effect, is binding on the Attorney General.  <em>See United States v. Nixon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html">418 U. S. 683</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html#695">418 U. S. 695</a></span>-696 (1974); <em>Vitarelli v. Seaton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/535/case.html">359 U. S. 535</a></span> (1959); <em>Service v. Dulles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/363/case.html">354 U. S. 363</a></span> (1957); <em>United States ex rel. Accardi v.

S. 260</a></span> (1954).</p>\n<p>Thus, both the statute and the regulation impose on the Attorney General a duty to review submitted statutes and disapprove them unless he is satisfied that they meet the standards established by the Act.  It is undisputed in this case that the Attorney General, after reviewing the reapportionment legislation submitted by South Carolina, was unable to make that determination. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  It was, therefore, his duty to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 432 U. S. 514</a></p><p> object to implementation of that legislation.  He did not perform that duty, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] deferring instead to a District Court judgment that the majority concedes should not have been entered. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority holds that this failure is insulated from judicial review under the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act expressly designed for such defaults, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 706(1), [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] for one reason only:  the statute contains a deadline within which the Attorney General must act.  This holding that the existence of a deadline for the performance of an administrative duty is a "persuasive reason" to believe that failure to perform that duty cannot be reviewed is unique among our decisions. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  I trust it will remain unique.  Nothing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 432 U. S. 515</a></p><p> in the existence of a deadline for the performance of an administrative duty provides persuasive reason -- or indeed any reason at all -- to believe that failure to perform that duty cannot be reviewed. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The illogic of the Court\'s argument transmogrifies a deadline for action into an impenetrable shield for inaction.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s conclusion is not only inconsistent with our description of \xc2\xa7 5 in <em>Georgia v. United States,</em> it is also flatly inconsistent with our holding in that case.  For in <em>Georgia v. United States,</em> we reviewed the standard by which the Attorney General determined to object to implementation of a submitted statute.  The majority approved of the standard, and the dissenters objected to it, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] but the Court unanimously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 432 U. S. 516</a></p><p> rejected the Government\'s argument that the propriety of the objection was "outside the permissible scope of judicial inquiry."  Brief for United States in <em>Georgia, v. United States,</em> O.T. 1972, No. 72-75, p. 38.</p>\n<p>The Court simply ignores this glaring contradiction between our action in <em>Georgia v. United States</em> and its holding today.  Since the Court does not overrule <em>Georgia v. United States,</em> I can only conclude that the law now allows review of the Attorney General\'s decision to object to implementation of a statute, but it does not allow review of his failure to object. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  I can find no support for such a bizarre rule.  I am sure that others, especially members of the Congress whose intent the Court is supposedly following, will be equally baffled.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Perhaps out of justifiable embarrassment, the majority never mentions the effect of its ruling.  That effect is easy to describe:  the Court today upholds a system of choosing members of the South Carolina Senate that has prevented the election of any black senators, despite the fact that 25% of South Carolina\'s population is black. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Thus, South Carolina, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 432 U.

S. 333</a></span>-334, is allowed to remain as one of the last successful members of that movement.  It would take much more evidence than the Court can muster to convince me that this result is consistent with "Congress\' firm intention to rid the country of racial discrimination in voting."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html#315">383 U.

S. 141</a></span>, that this result is compelled by the Act Congress passed to implement that intention.\n</em></p>\n<p>It is true that today\'s decision does not quite spell the end of all hope that the South Carolina Senate will someday be representative of the entire citizenry of South Carolina.  If the Decennial Census in 1980 requires substantial reapportionment, and if the Voting Rights Act is still in effect when that reapportionment takes place, and if the then Attorney General is conscientious, the devices approved today will be rejected under the strict standards of \xc2\xa7 5.  <em>See Georgia v.

This highly contingent possibility that the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment will be realized in South Carolina, some 110 years after that Amendment was ratified, is apparently sufficient in the eyes of the majority.  It is not sufficient for me, as it was not for Congress, which wrote the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to put an end to what was then "nearly a century of widespread resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment."  <em>South Carolina v.

The conclusion in that case that review is precluded when Congress says so obviously does not support the conclusion that review is also precluded when Congress has not said so.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Under today\'s holding, of course, the Attorney General is now granted license to make the entirely "implausible" response of failing to enter an objection no matter how incomplete or inadequate the State\'s submission may be.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Curiously, the Court never mentions this regulation.  The portion of the regulation not quoted in text reads as follows:</p>\n<p>"Section 5, in providing for submission to the Attorney General as an alternative to seeking a declaratory judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, imposes on the Attorney General what is essentially a judicial function.  Therefore, the burden of proof on the submitting authority is the same in submitting changes to the Attorney General as it would be in submitting changes to the District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Attorney General shall base his decision on a review of material presented by the submitting authority, relevant information provided by individuals or groups, and the results of any investigation conducted by the Department of Justice."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>As the majority notes, the Attorney General objected to Act 932 because of the combination of multimember districts, numbered posts, and a majority runoff requirement.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#495">432 U. S. 495</a></span>, and n. 4.  The same objectionable features are contained in the senate reapportionment plan of Act 1205.  The Attorney General did not object to that plan solely because he felt "constrained to defer" to the holding in <em>Twiggs v. West,</em> Civ. No. 71-1106 (SC, Apr. 7, 1972), that the aspects of the reapportionment plan to which he had objected did not establish a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment because they were not racially motivated.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html#496">432 U.

That the Attorney General nevertheless maintained his belief that these features are inconsistent with the Voting Rights Act is shown by his simultaneous action in objecting to their extension to all other multimember districts in the State.  App. 47.  The Attorney General felt himself free to enter that objection because the <em>Twiggs</em> court had approved only the legislation relating to the Senate.  <em>See also</em> App. to Brief for Appellants 4a (memorandum submitted by Attorney General to court in <em>Harper v. Kleindienst,</em> 362 F.Supp. 742 (DC 1973), reiterating that Act 1205 would be objectionable but for the holding in <em>Twiggs v.

Of course, this concern would only be relevant if it were necessarily true that the State could not implement the new law between the expiration of the 60-day period and the final judicial determination requiring the Attorney General to reexamine the statute.

Neither, I think, did Congress anticipate that the Attorney General could discharge his statutory duty by simply stating that he had not been persuaded that a proposed change in election procedures would not have the forbidden discriminatory effect.  It is far more realistic and reasonable to assume that Congress expected the Attorney General to give his careful and good faith consideration to \xc2\xa7 5 submissions and, within 60 days after receiving all information he deemed necessary, <em>to make up his mind as to whether the proposed change did or did not have a discriminatory purpose or effect, and if it did, to object thereto.</em>"</p>\n<p>411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html#543">411 U.
