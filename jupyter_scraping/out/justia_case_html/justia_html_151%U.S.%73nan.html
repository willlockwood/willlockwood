The court overruled the exception that the petition did not show that the plaintiff was without fault or negligence.  The defendant thereupon, in support of the answer setting up contributory negligence of the plaintiff,</p>\n<p>"introduced evidence tending to show that at the time of accident, the plaintiff was on top of the car from which he was thrown, and walking upright, with his face towards the approaching engine, and further evidence tending to show that the car upon which plaintiff was at work was separated from certain other cars on said track by an open space of fifty or sixty feet, and that the engine in motion ran against and struck certain other cars on said side track, pushed them over this intervening space, and ran them against the car upon which plaintiff had been at work.

Roy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/451/case.html">102 U. S. 451</a></span>; <em>New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad v. Madison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/524/case.html">123 U. S. 524</a></span>.</p>\n<p>By the settled law of this Court, not controverted at the bar, contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff need not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 151 U. S. 78</a></p><p> be negatived or disproved by him, but the burden of proving it is upon the defendant.  <em>Inland &amp; Seaboard Co. v. Tolson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/139/551/case.html">139 U. S. 551</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/139/551/case.html#557">139 U. S. 557</a></span>.  The omission of the court to instruct the jury upon the subject of the plaintiff\'s contributory negligence is not open to exception, because the bill of exceptions does not show that the defendant requested any instruction upon that subject.  In England, it it misdirection, and not nondirection, which is the subject of a bill of exceptions.  <em>Anderson v. Fitzgerald,</em> 4 H.L.Cas. 484, 499.  In this country, the rule is somewhat more liberal, and the not giving an instruction upon a point in issue may be excepted to if one was requested, but not otherwise.  In a very early case, Chief Justice Marshall said:</p>\n<p>"There can be no doubt of the right of a party to require the opinion of the court on any point of law which is pertinent to the issue, nor that the refusal of the court to give such opinion furnishes cause for an exception."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/62/case.html">Smith v. Carrington,</a></span></em> 4 Cranch 62,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/62/case.html#71">8 U. S. 71</a></span>.  As afterwards more fully stated by Mr. Justice Story,</p>\n<p>"It is no ground of reversal that the court below omitted to give directions to the jury upon any points of law which might arise in the cause when it was not requested by either party at the trial.  It is sufficient for us that the court has given no erroneous directions.  If either party deems any point presented by the evidence to be omitted in the charge, it is competent for said party to require an opinion from the court upon that point. If he does not, it is a waiver of it."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/1/case.html">Pennock v.

A request for instructions, being necessary to entitle the excepting party to avail himself of an omission to instruct, cannot be presumed, but must affirmatively appear in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p>The testimony of one of the men who were working with the plaintiff in unloading the car at the time of the injury that they were busy at their work and did not think of the approach of the engine until it struck the car related to facts which might naturally be within his knowledge, and be apparent from the behavior of the workmen, and was competent, though perhaps not important, evidence upon the issue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 151 U. S. 79</a></p><p> of contributory negligence presented by the defendant\'s answer.</p>\n<p>The testimony as to the circumstances of the continuance of the plaintiff in the employ of the iron works, after being injured, was offered only "to show the character of the work performed by the plaintiff, both before and after the accident," and was competent evidence upon the question how far his capacity of earning a livelihood had been impaired by his injuries.  <em>Vicksburg &amp;c.
