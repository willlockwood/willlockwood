Because of abuses by theatrical agents who, as independent contractors, negotiated employment contracts for actors and actresses with producers, particularly abuses as to the extraction of high commissions tending to undermine collectively bargained rates of compensation, the union, in 1928, unilaterally established a licensing system for the regulation of agents, prohibiting union members from using an agent who has not obtained a license from the union.  The essential elements of the licensing system have remained unchanged.  To obtain a license, an agent must agree to comply with union regulations which, <em>inter alia,</em> prohibit agent commissions on scale portions of wages received by an actor or an actress from a producer, limit commissions on wages in excess of scale pay, and require payment to the union of franchise fees.  Petitioners, agents who refused to obtain union licenses, instituted this action, contending that the union\'s regulations violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

S. 706</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The respondent Actors\' Equity Association (Equity) is a union representing the vast majority of stage actors and actresses in the United States.  It enters into collective bargaining agreements with theatrical producers that specify minimum wages and other terms and conditions of employment for those whom it represents.  The petitioners are independent theatrical agents who place actors and actresses in jobs with producers.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the respondents\' [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] system of regulation of theatrical agents is immune from antitrust liability by reason of the statutory labor exemption from the antitrust laws, 622 F.2d 647. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We granted certiorari to consider the availability of that exemption in the circumstances presented by this case.  449 U.S. 991.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Equity is a national union that has represented stage actors and actresses since early in this century.  Currently representing approximately 23,000 actors and actresses, it has collective bargaining agreements with virtually all major theatrical producers in New York City, on and off Broadway, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="707">Page 451 U. S. 707</a></p><p> and with most other theatrical producers throughout the United States.  The terms negotiated with producers are the minimum conditions of employment (called "scale"); an actor or actress is free to negotiate wages or terms more favorable than the collectively bargained minima.</p>\n<p>Theatrical agents are independent contractors who negotiate contracts and solicit employment for their clients.  The agents do not participate in the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements between Equity and the theatrical producers.  If an agent succeeds in obtaining employment for a client, he receives a commission based on a percentage of the client\'s earnings.  Agents who operate in New York City must be licensed as employment agencies, and are regulated by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs pursuant to New York law, which provides that the maximum commission a theatrical agent may charge his client is 10% of the client\'s compensation.</p>\n<p>In 1928, concerned with the high unemployment rates in the legitimate theater and the vulnerability of actors and actresses to abuses by theatrical agents, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] including the extraction of high commissions that tended to undermine collectively bargained rates of compensation, Equity unilaterally established a licensing system for the regulation of agents.  The regulations permitted Equity members to deal only with those agents who obtained Equity licenses and thereby agreed to meet the conditions of representation prescribed by Equity.  Those members who dealt with nonlicensed agents were subject to union discipline.</p>\n<p>The system established by the Equity regulations was immediately challenged. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In <em>Edelstein v. Gillmore,</em> 35 F.2d </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 451 U. S. 708</a></p><p> 723! the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the regulations were a lawful effort to improve the employment conditions of Equity members.  In an opinion written by Judge Swan and joined by Judge Augustus N. Hand, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the court said:</p>\n<p>"The evils of unregulated employment agencies (using this term broadly to include also the personal representative) are set forth in the defendants\' affidavits and are corroborated by common knowledge. . . .  Hence the requirement that, as a condition to writing new business with Equity\'s members, old contracts with its members must be made to conform to the new standards, does not seem to us to justify an inference that the primary purpose of the requirement is infliction of injury upon plaintiff, and other personal representatives in a similar situation, rather than the protection of the supposed interests of Equity\'s members.  <em>The terms they insist upon are calculated to secure from personal representatives better and more impartial service, at uniform and cheaper rates, and to improve conditions of employment of actors by theater managers.</em>  Undoubtedly the defendants intend to compel the plaintiff to give up rights under existing contracts which do not conform to the new standards set up by Equity, but, as already indicated, <em>their motive in so doing is to benefit themselves and their fellow actors in the economic struggle.</em>  The financial loss to plaintiff is incidental to this purpose."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 726 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 451 U. S. 709</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The essential elements of Equity\'s regulation of theatrical agents have remained unchanged since 1928. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  A member of Equity is prohibited, on pain of union discipline, from using an agent who has not, through the mechanism of obtaining an Equity license (called a "franchise"), agreed to comply with the regulations.  The most important of the regulations requires that a licensed agent must renounce any right to take a commission on an employment contract under which an actor or actress receives scale wages. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  To the extent a contract includes provisions under which an actor or actress will sometimes receive scale pay -- for rehearsals or "chorus" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 451 U. S. 710</a></p><p> employment, for example -- and sometimes more, the regulations deny the agent any commission on the scale portions of the contract.  Licensed agents are also precluded from taking commissions on out-of-town expense money paid to their clients.  Moreover, commissions are limited on wages within 10% of scale pay, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and an agent must allow his client to terminate a representation contract if the agent is not successful in procuring employment within a specified period. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Finally, agents are required to pay franchise fees to Equity.  The fee is $200 for the initial franchise, $60 a year thereafter for each agent, and $40 for any subagent working in the office of another.  These fees are deposited by Equity in its general treasury, and are not segregated from other union funds.</p>\n<p>In 1977, after a dispute between Equity and Theatrical Artists Representatives Associates (TARA) -- a trade association representing theatrical agents, <em>see</em> <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra</em> -- a group of agents, including the petitioners, resigned from TARA because of TARA\'s decision to abide by Equity\'s regulations.  These agents also informed Equity that they would not accept Equity\'s regulations, or apply for franchises.  The petitioners instituted this lawsuit in May, 1978, contending that Equity\'s regulations of theatrical agents violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 451 U. S. 711</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court found, after a bench trial, that Equity\'s creation and maintenance of the agency franchise system were fully protected by the statutory labor exemptions from the antitrust laws, and accordingly dismissed the petitioners\' complaint.  478 F.Supp. 496 (SDNY).  Among its factual conclusions, the trial court found that in the theatrical industry, agents play a critical role in securing employment for actors and actresses:</p>\n<p>"As a matter of general industry practice, producers seek actors and actresses for their productions through agents.  Testimony in this case convincingly established that an actor without an agent does not have the same access to producers or the same opportunity to be seriously considered for a part as does an actor who has an agent.  Even principal interviews, in which producers are required to interview all actors who want to be considered for principal roles, do not eliminate the need for an agent, who may have a greater chance of gaining an audition for his client."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Testimony confirmed that agents play an integral role in the industry; without an agent, an actor would have significantly lesser chances of gaining employment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 497, 502.  The court also found</p>\n<p>"no evidence to suggest the existence of any conspiracy or illegal combination between Actors\' Equity and TARA or between Actors\' Equity and producers,"</p>\n<p>and concluded that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Actors Equity franchising system was employed by Actors\' Equity for the purpose of protecting the wages and working conditions of its members."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 499.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  It determined that the threshold issue was, under <em>United States v. Hutcheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html">312 U. S. 219</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#232">312 U. S. 232</a></span>, whether Equity\'s franchising system involved any combination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="712">Page 451 U. S. 712</a></p><p> between Equity and any "non-labor groups" or persons who are not "parties to a labor dispute."  622 F.2d at 648-649.  If it did, the court reasoned, the protection of the statutory labor exemption would not apply.</p>\n<p>First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court had not been clearly erroneous in finding no agreement, explicit or tacit, between Equity and the producers to establish or police the franchising system.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Next, the court turned to the relationship between the union and those agents who had agreed to become franchised, in order to determine whether those agreements would divest Equity\'s system of agency regulation of the statutory exemption.  Relying on <em>Musicians v. Carroll,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html">391 U. S. 99</a></span>, the court concluded that the agents were themselves a "labor group," because of their substantial "economic interrelationship" with Equity, under which "the union [could] not eliminate wage competition among its members without regulation of the fees of the agents."  622 F.2d at 650, 651.  Accordingly, since the elimination of wage competition is plainly within the area of a union\'s legitimate self-interest, the court concluded that the exemption was applicable. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>After deciding that the central feature of Equity\'s franchising system -- the union\'s exaction of an agreement by agents not to charge commissions on certain types of work -- was immune from antitrust challenge, the Court of Appeals turned to the petitioners\' challenge of the franchise fees exacted from agents.  Equity had argued that the fees were necessary to meet its expenses in administering the franchise system, but no evidence was presented at trial to show that the costs justified the fees actually levied.  The Court of Appeals suggested that, if the exactions exceeded the true </p><p><a class="page-number" name="713">Page 451 U. S. 713</a></p><p> costs, they could not legally be collected, as such exactions would be unconnected with any of the goals of national labor policy that justify the labor antitrust exemption.  Despite the lack of any cost evidence at trial, however, the appellate court reasoned that the fees were sufficiently low that a remand to the District Court on this point "would not serve any useful purpose."  <em>Id.</em> at 651.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Labor unions are lawful combinations that serve the collective interests of workers, but they also possess the power to control the character of competition in an industry.  Accordingly, there is an inherent tension between national antitrust policy, which seeks to maximize competition, and national labor policy, which encourages cooperation among workers to improve the conditions of employment. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In the years immediately following passage of the Sherman Act, courts enjoined strikes as unlawful restraints of trade when a union\'s conduct or objectives were deemed "socially or economically harmful."  <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/443/case.html">254 U. S. 443</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/443/case.html#485">254 U. S. 485</a></span> (Brandeis, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In response to these practices, Congress acted, first in the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, and later in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, to immunize labor unions and labor disputes from challenge under the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 17, declares that human labor "is not a commodity or article of commerce," and immunizes from antitrust liability labor organizations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="714">Page 451 U. S. 714</a></p><p> and their members "lawfully carrying out" their "legitimate object[ives]."  Section 20 of the Act prohibits injunctions against specified employee activities, such as strikes and boycotts, that are undertaken in the employees\' self-interest and that occur in the course of disputes "concerning terms or conditions of employment," and states that none of the specified acts can be "held to be [a] violatio[n] of any law of the United States."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 52.  This protection is reemphasized and expanded in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which prohibits federal court injunctions against single or organized employees engaged in enumerated activities, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and specifically forbids such injunctions notwithstanding the claim of an unlawful combination or conspiracy.  While the Norris-LaGuardia Act\'s bar of federal court labor injunctions is not explicitly phrased as an exemption from the antitrust laws, it has been interpreted broadly as a statement of congressional policy that the courts must not use the antitrust laws as a vehicle to interfere in labor disputes. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Hutcheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html">312 U. S. 219</a></span>, the Court held that labor unions acting in their self-interest and not in combination with nonlabor groups enjoy a statutory exemption from Sherman Act liability.  After describing the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="715">Page 451 U. S. 715</a></p><p> congressional responses to judicial interference in union activity,  <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#229">312 U. S. 229</a></span>-230, the Court declared that,</p>\n<p>"[s]o long as a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups, the licit and the illicit under \xc2\xa7 20 [of the Clayton Act] are not to be distinguished by any judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#232">312 U. S. 232</a></span> (footnote omitted).  The Court explained that this exemption derives not only from the Clayton Act, but also from the Norris-LaGuardia Act, particularly its definition of a "labor dispute," <em>see</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>supra,</em> in which Congress "reasserted the original purpose of the Clayton Act by infusing into it the immunized trade union activities as redefined by the later Act."  312 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#236">312 U. S. 236</a></span>.  Thus, under <em>Hutcheson,</em> no federal injunction may issue over a "labor dispute," and</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 20 [of the Clayton Act] removes all such allowable conduct from the taint of being a \'violation of any law of the United States,\' including the Sherman [Act]."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The statutory exemption does not apply when a union combines with a "non-labor group."  <em>Hutcheson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#232">312 U. S. 232</a></span>.  Accordingly, antitrust immunity is forfeited when a union combines with one or more employers in an effort to restrain trade.  In <em>Allen Bradley Co. v.

The answer to this question is best understood in light of <em>Musicians v. Carroll,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html">391 U. S. 99</a></span>.  There, four orchestra leaders, members of the American Federation of Musicians, brought an action based on the Sherman Act challenging the union\'s unilateral system of regulating "club dates," or one-time musical engagements.  These regulations, <em>inter alia,</em> enforced a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="718">Page 451 U.

The Court agreed with the trial court that the applicable test was whether there was</p>\n<p>"job or wage competition or some other economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests between the union members and the independent contractors."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html#106">391 U.

Accordingly, these restrictions had to meet the "other economic interrelationship" branch of the disjunctive test quoted above.  And the test was met because those restrictions were "<em>at least as intimately bound up with the subject of wages\' . . . as the price floors."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html#113">391 U.

[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The essential features of the regulatory scheme are identical:  members are permitted to deal only with agents who have agreed (1) to honor their fiduciary obligations by avoiding conflicts of interest, (2) not to charge excessive commissions, and (3) not to book members for jobs paying less than the union minimum.

[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The agent stands directly between union members and jobs, and is in a powerful position to evade the union\'s negotiated wage structure.</p>\n<p>The peculiar structure of the legitimate theater industry, where work is intermittent, where it is customary, if not essential, for union members to secure employment through agents, and where agents\' fees are calculated as a percentage of a member\'s wage, makes it impossible for the union to defend even the integrity of the minimum wages it has negotiated without regulation of agency fees. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  The regulations are "brought within the labor exemption [because they are] necessary to assure that scale wages will be paid. . . ."  <em>Carroll,</em> 391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html#112">391 U.

Agents must, therefore, be considered a "labor group," and their controversy with Equity is plainly a "labor dispute" as defined in the Norris-LaGuardia Act:</p>\n<p>"representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 113(c).</p>\n<p>Agents perform a function -- the representation of union members in the sale of their labor -- that, in most nonentertainment industries, is performed exclusively by unions.  In effect, Equity\'s franchise system operates as a substitute for maintaining a hiring hall as the representative of its members seeking employment. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, Equity\'s regulations are clearly designed to promote the union\'s legitimate self-interest.  <em>Hutcheson,</em> 312 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#232">312 U.

In a case such as this, where there is no direct wage or job competition between the union and the group it regulates, the <em>Carroll</em> formulation to determine the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="722">Page 451 U.

We have concluded that Equity\'s justification for these fees is inadequate.  Conceding that <em>Carroll</em> did not sanction union extraction of franchise fees from agents, [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] Equity suggests, only in the most general terms, that the fees are somehow related to the basic purposes of its regulations:  elimination of wage competition, upholding of the union wage scale, and promotion of fair access to jobs.  But even assuming that the fees no more than cover the costs of administering the regulatory system, this is simply another way of saying that, without the fees, the union\'s regulatory efforts would not be subsidized -- and that the dues of Equity\'s members would perhaps have to be increased to offset the loss of a general revenue source. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  If Equity did not impose these franchise fees upon the agents, there is no reason to believe that any of its legitimate interests would be affected.

The regulations have undergone revision in some details, largely as a result of negotiations between Equity and Theatrical Artists Representatives Associates (TARA), which, until shortly before this litigation began, was the only association voicing the concerns of agents with regard to their representation of Equity members.  Until their voluntary resignation in late 1977, most of the petitioners were members of TARA.  The petitioners are now members of the National Association of Talent Representatives (NATR).  Unlike TARA, which functions only in the legitimate theater field, NATR also functions in the fields of motion pictures and television.  In those fields, agents operate under closely analogous agent regulations maintained by the Screen Actors\' Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.</p>\n<p>The history of the negotiations and disputes between Equity and TARA are described in the opinion of the District Court in the present case.  478 F.Supp. 496, 498 (SDNY).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The minimum, or "scale," wage varies.  In August, 1977, for example, the minimum weekly salary was $335 for Broadway performances, and $175 for performances off Broadway.  Scale wages are set by a collective bargaining agreement between Equity and the producers, to which the agents are not parties.  When an agent represents an actor or actress whose professional reputation is not sufficient to demand a salary higher than scale, the agent hopes to develop a relationship that will become continually more remunerative as the performer\'s professional reputation grows, and with it the power to demand an ever higher salary.  No agent is required to represent an actor or actress whom he does not wish to represent .</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>It is Equity\'s view that commissions in the industry are not necessarily related to efforts by the agents, and that an agent often functions as little more than an "order taker," who is able to collect a percentage of a client\'s wages for the duration of a show for doing little more than answering a producer\'s telephone call.  Indeed, an agent may collect a commission on the salary of an actor or actress he represents even if the client obtains the job without the agent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Equity argues that this restriction is necessary because there is an incentive for agents to represent as many actors and actresses as possible -- and not necessarily to serve them all well -- because an agent receives a commission whenever his client is employed at a salary higher than scale, regardless of the extent of his involvement in obtaining employment for the client.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals recognized that, even if there had been an agreement between Equity and a "non-labor group," the agreement might still have been protected from the antitrust laws under the "non-statutory" exemption.  622 F.2d at 649, n. 1.  <em>See Connell Construction Co. v.

S. 114</a></span>, drew parallels with the restrictions at issue in the present case.  The court noted that "[a]pparently, similar abuses by booking agents existed in other fields too.  <em>Edelstein v. Gillmore,</em> 35 F.2d 723, 726 (2d Cir.1929) (actors)."  <em>Carroll v. AFM,</em> 241 F.Supp. 865, 892 (SDNY).</p>\n<p>The petitioners argue that theatrical agents are indistinguishable from "numerous [other] groups of persons who merely supply products and services to union members," such as landlords, grocers, accountants, and lawyers.  But it is clear that agents differ from these groups in two critical respects:  the agents control access to jobs and negotiation of the terms of employment.  For the actor or actress, therefore, agent commissions are not merely a discretionary expenditure of disposable income, but a virtually inevitable concomitant of obtaining employment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Carroll v.

Wage competition is prevented not only by the rule precluding commissions on scale jobs.  Actors and actresses could also compete over the percentage of their wages they were willing to cede to an agent, subject only to the restrictions imposed by state law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>In many industries, unions maintain hiring halls and other job referral systems, particularly where work is typically temporary and performed on separate project sites, rather than fixed locations.  By maintaining halls, unions attempt to eliminate abuses such as kickbacks, and to insure fairness and regularity in the system of access to employment.  In a 1947 Senate Report, Senator Taft explained:</p>\n<p>"The employer should be able to make a contract with the union as an employment agency.  The union frequently is the best employment agency.  The employer should be able to give notice of vacancies, and, in the normal course of events, to accept men sent to him by the hiring hall."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1827, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 13 (1947), quoted in <em>Teamsters v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/667/case.html">365 U.

We have, in fact, found no case holding that a union may extract such fees from independent agents who represent union members.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>As already indicated, the franchise fees are not segregated in any manner, but merely deposited in the union\'s general fund.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondents offer union hiring hall fees as an analogy in support of Equity\'s collection of franchise fees.  In that context, the respondents argue, without citation, that a union may impose reasonable fees upon employers to meet the costs of maintaining a union-run hiring hall.  But even if the respondents\' statement of labor law is correct, the analogy would not be persuasive.  Assuming that hiring hall fees are so imposed, the fees are borne by parties who directly benefit from the employment services of the hiring halls and are collected by the entities that provide them.  That is not true in the present case.</p>\n<p>The view expressed in the separate opinion filed today as to who are the beneficiaries of the franchising system will undoubtedly surprise the agents who brought this lawsuit.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/704/case.html#724">451 U. S. 724</a></span>.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join all but  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/704/case.html#722">451 U. S. </a></span>  That part holds that respondents\' exaction of a franchise fee is not a "permissible component of the exempt regulatory system."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/704/case.html#722">451 U. S. 722</a></span>.  Rather, I agree with the Court of Appeals that the approximately $12,000 collected annually in fees is not "incommensurate with Equity\'s expenses in maintaining a full-time employee to administer the system," 622 F.2d 647, 651 (CA2 1980), and thus is not "unconnected with any of the goals of national labor policy which justify the antitrust exemption for labor," <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court justifies its conclusion by suggesting that, since the union could increase its dues to offset the revenue lost from invalidation of the fee system, "there is no reason to believe that any of [the union\'s] legitimate interests would be affected," if the fee system were found to violate the antitrust laws.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/704/case.html#722">451 U. S. 722</a></span>.  The union could, of course, raise its dues, but the issue here is whether the conceded antitrust immunity of the franchising system includes the franchise fee.</p>\n<p>I find somewhat incongruous the Court\'s conclusion that an incident of the overall system constitutes impermissible regulation, but that agents in general may be significantly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 451 U. S. 724</a></p><p> regulated because they are not a "nonlabor group."  This incongruity is highlighted by the similarity between union hiring halls and the franchising system, a similarity which the Court itself acknowledges:</p>\n<p>"Equity\'s franchise system operates as a substitute for maintaining a hiring hall as the representative of its members seeking employment."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">451 U. S. 721</span>.  The Court disregards this similarity in concluding that the franchising system does not "directly benefit" the agents who are required to pay the fees.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/704/case.html#722">451 U. S. 722</a></span>, n. 31.  It reaches this conclusion by incorrectly assuming that the only parties who directly benefit from the hiring hall and the franchising system are employers and employees and producers and actors, as the case may be.  But surely the agents also benefit from the franchising system, which provides an orderly and protective mechanism for pairing actors who seek jobs with producers who seek actors.  The system is thus the means by which the agents ultimately receive their commissions; it is as much the source of their livelihood as it is that of the actors.</p>\n<p>Because the fee is an incident of a legitimate scheme of regulation, and because it is commensurate in amount with the purpose for which it is sought, I would also affirm this holding of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
