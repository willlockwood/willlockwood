Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of respondent Archie Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s murder conviction.  Because it is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment must be reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tArchie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer in order to steal his car.  Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer, tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him.  Dixon then used Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate and social security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s name.  After using that identification card to establish ownership of Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s car, Dixon sold the vehicle for $2,800.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tHammer\xe2\x80\x99s mother reported her son missing the day after his murder.  While investigating Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are relevant here.  On November 4, 1993, a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station.  It is undisputed that this was a chance encounter\xe2\x80\x94Dixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation.  The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then asked to talk to him about Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966).  Dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tAs their investigation continued, police determined that Dixon had sold Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s car and forged Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s signature when cashing the check he received in that sale.  Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November 9.  Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking with him for about 45 minutes total.  Prior to the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse to speak with them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tDixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s name and signing Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s name on the check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell the car.  Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee.  The detectives challenged the plausibility of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s tale and told Dixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information.  At one point a detective told Dixon that \xe2\x80\x9cnow is the time to say\xe2\x80\x9d whether he had any involvement in Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance because \xe2\x80\x9cif Tim starts cutting a deal over there, this is kinda like, a bus leaving.  The first one that gets on it is the only one that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get on.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a.  Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew anything about Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, Hoffner had not told him.  Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing whatsoever\xe2\x80\x9d to do with Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.  Id., at 186a.  At approximately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s grave.  Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer was buried there.  After concluding their interview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police station.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tDixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.  Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in custody.  The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, \xe2\x80\x9cI talked to my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d  State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004\xe2\x80\x93Ohio\xe2\x80\x931585, 805 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1042, 1050.  The police read Dixon his Miranda rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke with Dixon for about half an hour.  At 8 p.m. the police, now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his Miranda rights.  In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the blame on Hoffner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tAt Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder.  The State took an interlocutory appeal.  The State did not dispute that Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s forgery confession was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible because Dixon had received Miranda warnings prior to that confession.  The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s murder confession to be admitted as evidence.  Dixon was convicted of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sentenced to death.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s convictions and sentence.  To analyze the admissibility of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s murder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298 (1985).  The Ohio Supreme Court found that Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s confession to murder after receiving Miranda warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.  State v. Dixon, supra, at 332\xe2\x80\x93334, 805 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1050\xe2\x80\x931052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite Miranda warnings\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tDixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  Dixon claimed, inter alia, that the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law.  The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed.  Dixon v. Houk, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 553 (2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d as set forth in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings, or was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the state court record.  \xc2\xa72254(d); see Harrington, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision contained three such egregious errors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tFirst, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer.  That is plainly wrong.  It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on November 4.  And this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cnever held that a person can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than \xe2\x80\x98custodial interrogation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 171, 182, n.\xc2\xa03 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the defendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its progeny] do not apply\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the \n Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to \xe2\x80\x9ccut a deal\xe2\x80\x9d before his accomplice Hoffner did so.  The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court\xe2\x80\x94or any court\xe2\x80\x94holding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional.  Cf., e.g., Elstad, supra, at 317 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, does so involuntarily\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because no holding of this Court suggests, much less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThird, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably applied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent in Elstad.  In that case, a suspect who had not received Miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody.  Approximately an hour later, after he had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again confessed to the same burglary.  This Court held that the later, warned confession was admissible because \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of Miranda, was voluntary.  The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement was also voluntarily made.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318 (footnote omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tAs the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explained, the circumstances surrounding Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s interrogations demonstrate that his statements were voluntary.  During Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.  He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s name, even stating that the police were \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome\xe2\x80\x9d to that information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.  State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1049.  Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.  Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s first in- terrogation involved \xe2\x80\x9can intentional Miranda violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court concluded, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cas in Elstad, the breach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual compulsion\xe2\x80\x9d and thus there was no reason to suppress Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s later, warned confession.  101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334, 805 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was the product of a \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate question-first, warn-later strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d  627 F. 3d, at 557.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600 (2004).  In Seibert, police employed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20-minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her to repeat her prior confession.  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604\xe2\x80\x93606, 616 (plurality opinion).  The Court held that Seibert\xe2\x80\x99s second confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it was preceded by a Miranda warning.  A plurality of the Court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak-  ing a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (detailing a \xe2\x80\x9cseries of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, noting he \xe2\x80\x9cwould apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 622.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tIn this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the type that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the Miranda warnings Dixon received.  In Seibert, the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s first, unwarned interrogation left \xe2\x80\x9clittle, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid,\xe2\x80\x9d making it \xe2\x80\x9cunnatural\xe2\x80\x9d not to \xe2\x80\x9crepeat at the second stage what had been said before.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 616\xe2\x80\x93617 (plurality opinion).  But in this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation that he had \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing whatso- ever\xe2\x80\x9d to do with Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a.  Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern here that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because there was no earlier confession to repeat.  Indeed, Dixon contradicted his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s earlier admission to forgery to induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even began.  As the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was simply \xe2\x80\x9cno nexus\xe2\x80\x9d between Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned admission to forgery and his later, warned confession to murder.  101 Ohio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1051.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tMoreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the Miranda warnings did not \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement\xe2\x80\x9d because the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuum.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 612, 617.  Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so here.  Four hours passed between Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned interrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and learned that police were talking to his accomplice and had found Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s body.  Things had changed.  Under Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances created \xe2\x80\x9ca new and distinct experience,\xe2\x80\x9d ensuring that Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s prior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warnings he received before confessing to Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe admission of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s murder confession was consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents: Dixon received Mi-  randa warnings before confessing to Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s murder; the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by the sort of \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-step interrogation technique\xe2\x80\x9d condemned in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s statements was the product of actual coercion.  That does not excuse the detectives\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation.  But the Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s forgery confession and the attendant statements given without the benefit of Miranda warnings.  Because no precedent of this Court required Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
