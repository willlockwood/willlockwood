So, a decision of the Leghorn court was held conclusive, 2 Stra. 733. 2nd, But be this as it may, it is clear that if a captain borrows and impawns the ship without necessity, it will not be good. Hob. p. 12. Mol. B. 2. ch. 2. sec. 14.3 Mod. 244.5. 3rd, He contended, in the last place, that the master cannot make his owners personally liable by his contract in a foreign port. Molloy B. 2. ch. 11. sec. 11, is in point, and so is Johnson v. Shippin, Salk. 35. The case in Cowper only applies to a contract for necessaries in the port where the owners reside.

This does not appear to have been the case in the present instance. But, in addition to that general rule, it is held, that the captain cannot hypothecate, while there are goods of his own, or of his owner on board. Now if there was no authority to hypothecate the vessel, how can it be pretended that he can make his owners personally liable? Great mischiefs would ensue if the master had such a power. Upon this ground, therefore, the action must fail. Another point, also, is in favor of the defendant; namely, that this very question has been already decided in the Court of Admiralty. Since, then, we think he had no authority to bind the persons of his owners in a foreign port (and in point of fact he does not seem to have done it, as the writing appears to bind only the captain and the vessel) and since the decision of the Admiralty on the merits, is, in our opinion, conclusive, the Plaintiff ought not to recover. </p><p> Verdict for the defendant. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1921467">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> CUPISINO v.
