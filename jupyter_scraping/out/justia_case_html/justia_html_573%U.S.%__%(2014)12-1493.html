To be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer\xe2\x80\x99s transactions with \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctransferees\xe2\x80\x9d without specifying whether that language refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser.  But when read in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw.  Federal gun law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of felons and other prohibited purchasers.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(c), 922(t).  It also imposes record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to their buyers.  \xc2\xa7922(b)(5), 923(g).  These provisions would mean little if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual rather than nominal buyer.  This conclusion is reinforced by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.

But Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s false statement prevented the dealer from insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a background check.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(b), (c), (t).  Nothing in the statute suggests that these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buyer turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun.  Because the dealer could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness of the sale.

Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain such records .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the Attorney General may .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7923(g)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those submissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on any person who, in connection with a firearm\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition, makes false statements about \xe2\x80\x9cany fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(a)(6).  In this case, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw purchaser\xe2\x80\x94namely, a person who buys a gun on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.  We hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable under the statute, whether or not the true buyer could have purchased the gun without the straw.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by licensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.  See Gun Control Act of 1968,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921 et\xc2\xa0seq.  Under \xc2\xa7922(g), certain classes of people\xe2\x80\x94felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, tolist a few\xe2\x80\x94may not purchase or possess any firearm.  And to ensure they do not, \xc2\xa7922(d) forbids a licensed dealer from selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer.  See Huddleston v. United States,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 814,\n825 (1974)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he focus of the federal scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d in controlling access to weapons, \xe2\x80\x9cis the federally licensed firearms dealer\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the dealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential buyer may lawfully own a gun.  Section 922(c) brings the would-be purchaser onto the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness premises\xe2\x80\x9d by prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of a firearm \xe2\x80\x9cto a person who does not appear in person\xe2\x80\x9d at that location.  Other provisions then require the dealer to check and make use of certain identifying information received from the buyer.  Before completing any sale, the dealer must \xe2\x80\x9cverif[y] the identity of the transferee by examining a valid identification document\xe2\x80\x9d bearing a photograph.  \xc2\xa7922(t)(1)(C).  In addition, the dealer must procure the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cname, age, and place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7922(b)(5).  And finally, the dealer must (with limited exceptions not at issue here[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]) submit that informationto the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) to determine whether the potential purchaser is forany reason disqualified from owning a firearm.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(t)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain records, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the law\xe2\x80\x99s verification measures and to trace firearms used in crimes.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1968).  A dealer must maintain the identifying information mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in its permanent files.  See \xc2\xa7922(b)(5).  In addition, the dealer must keep \xe2\x80\x9csuch records of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sale[ ] or other disposi-tion of firearms .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7923(g)(1)(A).  And the Attorney General (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those records, \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of a bona fide criminal investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[e] the disposition of 1 or more firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7923(g)(7).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To implement all those statutory requirements, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales.  See Supp. App. 1\xe2\x80\x936.  The part of that form to be completed by the buyer requests his name, birth date, and address, as well as certain other identifying information (for example, his height, weight, and race).  The form further lists all the factors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and asks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ave you ever been convicted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of a felony?\xe2\x80\x9d).  Id., at 1.  Most important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded emphasis appearing on the form itself):</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form?  Warning: You are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person.  If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The accompanying instructions for that question provide:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion 11.a.  Actual Transferee/Buyer: For purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/buyer if you are purchasing the firearm for yourselfor otherwise acquiring the firearm for yourself .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. You are also the actual transferee/buyer if you are legitimately purchasing the firearm as a gift for a third party.  ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER EXAM-PLES:  Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a firearm for Mr. Smith.  Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the money for the firearm.  Mr. Jones is NOT THE ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm and must answer \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d to question 11.a.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 4.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After responding to this and other questions, the customer must sign a certification declaring his answers \xe2\x80\x9ctrue, correct and complete.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2.  That certification provides that the signator \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand[s] that making any false .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. statement\xe2\x80\x9d respecting the transaction\xe2\x80\x94and, particularly, \xe2\x80\x9canswering \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 to question 11.a. if [he is] not the actual buyer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a crime \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable as a felony under Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that the dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s dis-closures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain false statements about firearms transactions.  First and foremost, \xc2\xa7922(a)(6), provides as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for any person in connection with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written statement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , intended or likely to deceive such [dealer] with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That provision helps make certain that a dealer will receive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a gun sale\xe2\x80\x99s legality.  In addition, \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records\xe2\x80\x9d of a federally licensed gun dealer.  The question in this case is whether, as the ATF declares in Form 4473\xe2\x80\x99s certification, those statutory provisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.\xe2\x80\x94that is, a customer\xe2\x80\x99s statement that he is the \xe2\x80\x9cactual transferee/buyer,\xe2\x80\x9d purchasing a firearm for himself, when in fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police officer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his uncle, Angel Alvarez.  (Abramski thought he could get the gun for a discount by showing his old police identification, though the Government contends that because he had been fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer authorized to use that card.)  Accepting his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s offer, Alvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with \xe2\x80\x9cGlock 19 handgun\xe2\x80\x9d written on the memo line.  Two days later, Abramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed firearms dealer, to make the purchase.  There, he filled out Form 4473, falsely checking \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d in reply to Question 11.a.\xe2\x80\x94that is, asserting he was the \xe2\x80\x9cactual transferee/buyer\xe2\x80\x9d when, according to the form\xe2\x80\x99s clear definition, he was not.  He also signed the requisite certification, acknowledging his understanding that a false answer to Question 11.a. is a federal crime.  After Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s name cleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him the Glock.  Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his bank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back a receipt.  Federal agents found that receipt while executing a search warrant at Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s home after he became a suspect in a different crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to Question 11.a. that he was the Glock\xe2\x80\x99s actual buyer.  Abramski moved to dismiss both charges.  He argued that his misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial to the lawfulness of the sale\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) because Alvarez was legally eligible to own a gun.  And he claimed that the false statement did not violate \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) because a buyer\xe2\x80\x99s response to Question 11.a. is not \xe2\x80\x9crequired .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be kept in the records\xe2\x80\x9d of a gun dealer.  After the District Court denied those motions, see 778 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.  The District Court then sentenced him to five years of probation on each count, running concurrently.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the convictions.  706 F.\xc2\xa03d 307 (2013).  It noted a division among appellate courts on the question Abramski raised about \xc2\xa7922(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement: Of three courts to have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski that a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial if \xe2\x80\x9cthe true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully purchase a firearm directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 315 (quoting United States v. Polk, 118 F.\xc2\xa03d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The Fourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position correct: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm is a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a firearm acquisition under \xc2\xa7922(a)(6).\xe2\x80\x9d  706 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 316.  The court also held that Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a dealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.  Id., at 317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), principally to resolve the Circuit split about \xc2\xa7922(a)(6).  In this Court, Abramski renews his claim that a false answer to Question 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible to purchase a firearm.  But Abramski now focuses on a new and more ambitious argument, which he concedes no court has previously accepted.  See Brief for Petitioner i.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  In brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a. is never material to a gun sale\xe2\x80\x99s legality, whether or not the actual buyer is eligible to own a gun.  We begin with that fundamental question, next turn to what has become Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s back-up argument under \xc2\xa7922(a)(6), and fi-nally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to \xc2\xa7924(A)(1)(a)\xe2\x80\x99s separate false-statement prohibition.  On each score, we affirm Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent) is that federal gun law simply does not care about arrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the person at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute.  That is true, Abramski contends, irrespective of any agreement that person has made to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else\xe2\x80\x94including someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun himself.  Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his \xe2\x80\x9cfalse statement that he was the [Glock 19\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\x98actual buyer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as that term was \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in Question 11.a., was not material\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indeed, was utterly irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto the lawfulness ofthe sale.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  In essence, he claims, Town Police Supply could legally have sold the gun to him even if had truthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he was a straw\xe2\x80\x94because, again, all the federal firearms law cares about is whether the individual standing at the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Fed-eral gun law regulates licensed dealers\xe2\x80\x99 transactions with \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctransferees,\xe2\x80\x9d without specifically referencing straw purchasers.  Section 922(d), for example, bars a dealer from \xe2\x80\x9csell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm to any \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d who falls within a prohibited category\xe2\x80\x94felons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth.  See supra, at 1\xe2\x80\x932; see also \xc2\xa7922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d the dealer must take down his name, age, and residence); \xc2\xa7922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d the dealer must run a background check).  Similarly, \xc2\xa7922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of the \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee\xe2\x80\x9d by checking a valid photo ID.  See supra, at 2; see also \xc2\xa7922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which a \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee\xe2\x80\x9d may buy a gun without appearing at the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s premises).  Abramski contends that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of such language alone, sans any mention of \xe2\x80\x9cstraw purchasers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cactual buyers,\xe2\x80\x9d shows that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not illegal to buy a gun for someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 15\xe2\x80\x9316; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But that language merely raises, rather than answers, the critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee\xe2\x80\x9d whom federal gun law addresses?  Is that \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d the middleman buying a firearm on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient could not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the transaction)?  Or is that \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d instead the individual really paying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon completion of the purchase?  Is it the conduit at the counter, or the gun\xe2\x80\x99s intended owner?[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] In answering that inquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context, \xe2\x80\x9cstructure, history, and purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26).  All those tools of divining meaning\xe2\x80\x94not to mention common sense, which is a fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of construing statutory terms fairly\xe2\x80\x94demonstrate that \xc2\xa7922, in regulating licensed dealers\xe2\x80\x99 gun sales, looks through the straw to the actual buyer.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The overarching reason is that Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s reading would undermine\xe2\x80\x94indeed, for all important purposes, would virtually repeal\xe2\x80\x94the gun law\xe2\x80\x99s core provisions.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  As noted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system to verify a would-be gun purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s identity and check on his background.  See supra, at 2.  It also requires that the information so gathered go into a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s permanent records.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The twin goals of this comprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them, and to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes.  See Huddleston, 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 824; supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  And no part of that scheme would work if the statute turned a blind eye to straw purchases\xe2\x80\x94if, in other words, the law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but only empty formalities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw purchase.  A felon or other person who cannot buy or own a gun still wants to obtain one.  (Or, alternatively, a person who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his purchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal purposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to him.)  Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an intermediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim.  Perhaps he conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps more often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a price.  The actual purchaser might even accompany the straw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy, give him the money to pay at the counter, and take possession as they walk out the door.  See, e.g., United States v. Bowen, 207 Fed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing a straw purchase along those lines); United States v. Paye, 129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (same).  What the true buyer would not do\xe2\x80\x94what he would leave to the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a minute\xe2\x80\x94is give his identifying information to the dealer and submit himself to a background check.  How many of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s provisions does that scenario\xe2\x80\x94the lawful result of Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s (and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s) reading of \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94render meaningless?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Start with the parts of \xc2\xa7922 enabling a dealer to verify whether a buyer is legally eligible to own a firearm.  That task, as noted earlier, begins with identification\xe2\x80\x94requesting the name, address, and age of the potential purchaser and checking his photo ID.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(b)(5), (t)(1)(C); supra, at 2.  And that identification in turn permits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s name through the NICS database to discover whether he is, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2.  All those provisions are designed to accomplish what this Court has previously termed Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in enacting the statute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto curb crime by keeping \xe2\x80\x98firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Huddleston, 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 824 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)).  But under Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual, because the identification and background check would be of the wrong person.  The provisions would evaluate the eligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal (and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment and walk away with a weapon.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Similarly, Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s view would defeat the point of \xc2\xa7922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns \xe2\x80\x9cto a person who does not appear in person at the licensee\xe2\x80\x99s business premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  See supra, at 2.  Only a narrow class of prospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar\xe2\x80\x94primarily, individuals who have already had their eligibility to own a firearm verified by state law enforcement officials with access to the NICS database.  See 27 CFR \xc2\xa7478.96(b) (2014),\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(t)(3); n.\xc2\xa01, supra.  And even when an individual fits within that category, he still must submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can lawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and address of the principal law enforcement officer in his community.  See \xc2\xa7922(c)(1).  The dealer then has to forward notice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law enforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the sale and, if necessary, call a stop to it.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  The provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small class of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures\xe2\x80\x94again, to ensure effective verification of a potential purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility.  Yet on Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s view, a person could easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without ever leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a hired deliveryman.  Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see no reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-than-pure motives) would put himself through the procedures laid out in \xc2\xa7922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And likewise, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s record-keeping provisions would serve little purpose if the records kept were of nominal rather than real buyers.  As noted earlier, dealers must store, and law enforcement officers may obtain, information about a gun buyer\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(b)(5), 923(g); supra, at 3.  That information helps to fight serious crime.  When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime scene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a suspect.  See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v. Jones, 716 F.\xc2\xa03d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s use of firearm tracing).  Too, the required records enable dealers to identify certain suspicious pur-chasing trends, which they then must report to federal authorities.  See \xc2\xa7923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obligation when a person buys multiple handguns within five days).  But once again, those provisions can serve their objective only if the records point to the person who took actual control of the gun(s).  Otherwise, the police will at most learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not have been responsible for the gun\xe2\x80\x99s use and might know next to nothing about the actual buyer.  See, e.g., United States v. Juarez, 626 F.\xc2\xa03d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw purchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found among Mexican gang members, for a buyer known \xe2\x80\x9conly as \xe2\x80\x98El Mano\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s view would thus render the required records close to useless for aiding law enforcement: Putting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a gun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper trail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun described above refer to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Read Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s way (\xe2\x80\x9cthe man at the counter\xe2\x80\x9d), those terms deny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could always use straw purchasers to evade the law.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Read the other way (\xe2\x80\x9cthe man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm\xe2\x80\x9d), those terms give effect to the statutory provi-sions, allowing them to accomplish their manifest objects.  That alone provides more than sufficient reason to understand \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransferee\xe2\x80\x9d as referring not to the fictitious but to the real buyer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And other language in \xc2\xa7922 confirms that construction, by evincing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s concern with the practical realities, rather than the legal niceties, of firearms transactions.  For example, \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) itself bars material misrepresentations \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the acquisition,\xe2\x80\x9d and not just the purchase, of a firearm.  That broader word, we have previously held, does not focus on \xe2\x80\x9clegal title\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94let alone legal title for a few short moments, until another, always intended transfer occurs.  Huddleston, 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 820.  Instead, the term signifies \xe2\x80\x9ccom[ing] into possession, control, or power of disposal,\xe2\x80\x9d as the actual buyer in a straw purchase does.  Ibid.  Similarly, we have reasoned that such a substance-over-form approach draws support from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe sale or other disposition\xe2\x80\x9d of a firearm.  \xc2\xa7922(a)(6); see \xc2\xa7922(d) (making it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9csell or otherwise dispose of\xe2\x80\x9d a gun to a prohibited person).  That term, we have stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwas aimed at providing maximum coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 826\xe2\x80\x93827.  We think such expansive language inconsistent with Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute, which would stare myopically at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the person exiting the transaction with control of the gun.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, our reading of \xc2\xa7922 comports with courts\xe2\x80\x99 standard practice, evident in many legal spheres and presumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when identifying the parties to a transaction.  In United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial Credit Co.,\n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219 (1939)\n, for example, we considered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any interest in property that was used to violate prohibition laws, except if acquired in good faith.  There, a straw purchaser had bought a car in his name but with his brother\xe2\x80\x99s money, and transferred it to the brother\xe2\x80\x94a known bootlegger\xe2\x80\x94right after driving it off the lot.  See id., at 222\xe2\x80\x93223.  The Court held the finance company\xe2\x80\x99s lien on the car non-forfeitable because the company had no hint that the straw was a straw\xe2\x80\x94that his brother would in fact be the owner.  See id., at 224.  But had the com-pany known, the Court made clear, a different result would have obtained: The company could not have relied on the formalities of the sale to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98straw\xe2\x80\x99 purchaser\xe2\x80\x9d when it knew that the \xe2\x80\x9creal owner and purchaser\xe2\x80\x9d of the car was someone different.  Id., at 223\xe2\x80\x93224.  We have similarly emphasized the need in other contexts, involving both criminal and civil penalties, to look through a transaction\xe2\x80\x99s nominal parties to its true participants.  See, e.g., American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183,\n193 (2010)\n (focusing on \xe2\x80\x9csubstance rather than form\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing when entities are distinct enough to be capable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory v. Helvering, \n\n293 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465,\n470 (1935)\n (disregarding an intermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes because doing otherwise would \xe2\x80\x9cexalt artifice above reality\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do no more than that here in holding, consistentwith \xc2\xa7922\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and purpose, that using a straw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such action is no circumvention\xe2\x80\x94that Congress made an intentional choice, born of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical compromise,\xe2\x80\x9d to limit the gun law\xe2\x80\x99s compass to the person at the counter, even if merely acting on another\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Reply Brief 11; post, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does not regulate beyond the initial point of sale.  Because the law mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a purchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to resell his gun to another private party.  See Reply Brief 11.  And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a gun for someone else as a gift.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9327, n.\xc2\xa03.  Abramski lumps in the same category the transfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer\xe2\x80\x94as something, like a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s (purported) standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer scope.  See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclusion from their observations about resales and gifts.  Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers\xe2\x80\x99 sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.  As we noted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal agent of federal enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9crestricting [criminals\xe2\x80\x99] access to firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 824.  And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely a result of compromise.  But no, straw arrangements are not a part of the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s sale.  In claiming as much, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption that the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d who acquires a gun from a dealer in a case like this one is the straw, rather than the individual who has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take possession of, own, and use that part of the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s stock.  For all the reasons we have already given, that is not a plausible construction of a statute mandating that the dealer identify and run a background check on the person to whom it is (really, not fictitiously)  selling a gun.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9315.  The individual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the most formal; and that distinguishes such a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun as a gift, from a private party.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  The line Congress drew between those who acquire guns from dealers and those who get them as gifts or on the secondary market, we suspect, reflects a host of things, including administrative simplicity and a view about where the most problematic firearm transactions\xe2\x80\x94like criminal organizations\xe2\x80\x99 bulk gun purchases\xe2\x80\x94typically occur.  But whatever the reason, the scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides no reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at the point of sale.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski claims further support for his argument from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision in 1986 to amend \xc2\xa7922(d) to prohibit a private party (and not just, as originally enacted, a licensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or reasonably should know cannot legally possess one.  See Firearm Owners\xe2\x80\x99 Protection Act, \xc2\xa7102(5)(A), 100 Stat. 451\xe2\x80\x93452.  According to Abramski, the revised \xc2\xa7922(d) should be understood as Congress\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive response to the potential dangers arising from straw purchases.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The amendment shows, he claims, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress chose to address this perceived problem in a way other than\xe2\x80\x9d by imposing liability under \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is the firearm\xe2\x80\x99s actual buyer.  Reply Brief 14, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But Congress\xe2\x80\x99s amendment of \xc2\xa7922(d) says nothing about \xc2\xa7922(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s application to straw purchasers.  In en-acting that amendment, Congress left \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) just asit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some-how intended to contract that provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  The amendment instead performed a different function: Rather than ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful information, it extended a minimal form of regulation to the secondary market.  The revised \xc2\xa7922(d) prevents a private person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligible owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon: It thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an individual who bought a gun for himself and later decided to resell it.  At the same time, \xc2\xa7922(d) has nothing to say about a raft of cases \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) covers, including all the (many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not know that the actual buyer is ineligible.  See supra, at 13.  Thus, \xc2\xa7922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for \xc2\xa7922(a)(6).  And the mere potential for some transactions to run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read \xc2\xa7922(d) as limiting \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) (or vice versa).  See, e.g., United States v. Batchelder,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114\n\xe2\x80\x93126 (1979).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s principal attack on his \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) conviction therefore fails.  Contrary to his contention, the information Question 11.a. requests\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[a]re you the actual transferee/buyer[?]\xe2\x80\x9d or, put conversely, \xe2\x80\x9care [you] acquir-ing the firearm(s) on behalf of another person[?]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is relevant to the lawfulness of a gun sale.  That is because, for all the reasons we have given, the firearms law contemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s but instead the true purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s identity and eligibility for gun ownership.  By concealing that Alvarez was the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from transacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see \xc2\xa7922(c), recording his name, age, and residence, see \xc2\xa7922(b)(5), inspecting his photo ID, see \xc2\xa7922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identifying information to the background check system, see \xc2\xa7922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited from receiving a firearm, see \xc2\xa7922(d).  In sum, Abramski thwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  We can hardly think of a misrepresentation any more material to a sale\xe2\x80\x99s legality.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski also challenges his \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) conviction on a narrower ground.  For purposes of this argument, he assumes that the Government can make its case when a straw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is legally ineligible to own a gun.  But, Abramski reminds us, that is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a gun for himself.  In such circumstances, Abramski claims that a false response to Question 11.a. is not material.  See Brief for Petitioner 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  Essentially, Abramski contends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to own a gun, all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well, and all should be forgiven.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But we think what we have already said shows the fallacy of that claim: Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law\xe2\x80\x94even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner.  The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with \xc2\xa7922(c)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on absentee purchases.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  If the dealer here, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact selling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the transaction for failure to comply with those conditions.  Yet more, the sale could not have gone forward because the dealer would have lacked the information needed to verify and record Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s identity and check his background.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C); supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  Those requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the real buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez would have passed the background check cannot somehow wipe them away.  Accordingly, had Town Police Supply known Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified, as Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was \xe2\x80\x9cnot unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully could own a gun.  But further suppose that, for reasons of his own, Smith uses an alias (let\xe2\x80\x99s say Jones) to make the purchase.  Would anyone say \xe2\x80\x9cno harm, no foul,\xe2\x80\x9d just because Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under \xc2\xa7922(d)?  We think not.  Smith would in any event have made a false statement about who will own the gun, impeding the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to carry out its legal responsibilities.  So too here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ckeeping guns out of the hands\xe2\x80\x9d of criminals and other prohibited persons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis not even implicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 29.  But that argument (which would apply no less to the alias scenario) misunderstands the way the statute works.  As earlier noted, the federal gun law makes the dealer \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he principal agent of federal enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Huddleston, 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 824, see supra, at 16.  It is that highly regulated, legally knowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive NICS database, which has the responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9c[e]nsure that, in the course of sales or other dispositions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , weapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose possession of them would be contrary to the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 825.  Nothing could be less consonant with the statutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of an unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be familiar with federal firearms law and has no ability to use the database to check whether the true buyer may own a gun.  And in any event, keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals is not \xc2\xa7922\xe2\x80\x99s only goal: The statute\xe2\x80\x99s record-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also designed to aid law enforcement in the investigation of crime.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s proposed limitation on \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose because many would-be criminals remain legally eligible to buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an endless stream of guns off-the-books.  See, e.g., Polk, 118 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to secretly accumulate an \xe2\x80\x9carsenal of weapons\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive offensive\xe2\x80\x9d against the Federal Government).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the ATF took the view that a straw purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation counted as material only if the true buyer could not legally possess a gun.  See Brief for Petitioner 7\xe2\x80\x938; n.\xc2\xa08, supra.  We may put aside that ATF has for almost two decades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting on both appellate case law and changes in the statute.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, \xc2\xa7103,\n\n107Stat.\n1541 (codified at\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(t)).  The critical point is that criminal laws are for courts, not for the Government, to construe.  See, e.g., United States v. Apel, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have never held that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference\xe2\x80\x9d).  We think ATF\xe2\x80\x99s old position no more relevant than its current one\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, not relevant at all.  Whether the Government interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it sometimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in construing \xc2\xa7922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its error.  Here, nothing suggests that Congress\xe2\x80\x94the entity whose voice does matter\xe2\x80\x94limited its prohibition of astraw purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation in the way Abramski proposes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records\xe2\x80\x9d of a federally licensed dealer.  That provision is broader than \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false statement at issue be \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d in any way.  At the same time, \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from \xc2\xa7922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to \xe2\x80\x9cinformation required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s] records.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abramski notes that the indictment in this case charged him with only one misrepresentation: his statement in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the Glock on his own behalf rather than on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s.  And, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cname, age, and place of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d which he plausibly reads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required \xe2\x80\x9cby this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but only by Form 4473 itself\xe2\x80\x94to be kept in the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s permanent records.  Brief for Petitioner 32.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We disagree.  Included in \xe2\x80\x9cthis chapter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chapter 44 of Title 18\xe2\x80\x94is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain such records of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3.  Because of that statutory section, the information that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information \xe2\x80\x9crequired by this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  And those regulations (the validity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand that every licensed dealer \xe2\x80\x9cretain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a part of [its] required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course of\xe2\x80\x9d selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm.  27 CFR \xc2\xa7478.124(b).  Accordingly, a false answer on that form, such as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a dealer is statutorily required to maintain.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        No piece of information is more important under federal firearms law than the identity of a gun\xe2\x80\x99s purchaser\xe2\x80\x94the person who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction with a licensed dealer.  Had Abramski admitted that he was not that purchaser, but merely a straw\xe2\x80\x94that he was asking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a background check on, the wrong individual\xe2\x80\x94the sale here could not have gone forward.  That makes Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under \xc2\xa7922(a)(6).  And because that statement pertained to information that a dealer must keep in its permanent records under the firearms law, Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Question 11.a. also violated \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A).

But first, that reservation is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s back-up argument, which imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy a gun, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reservation applies only when the straw has knowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact.  And as we will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge.  See , at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests on an uncertain legal theory.  According to the dissent, a straw buyer might violate \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) if a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s sale to him aids and abets his violation of \xc2\xa7922(d)\xe2\x80\x94a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun to an ineligible person, see  at 8, 17\xe2\x80\x9318.

As we will later discuss, see  at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, the ATF for a time thought that \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have legally purchased a gun himself.  But Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s principal argument extends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for criminals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers.  For the reasons just stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.  And although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testi-mony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the statute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago), ATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of prohibited persons.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">9</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The dissent responds: \xe2\x80\x9cThat certainly distinguishes\xe2\x80\x9d the individual transacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving a gun from a private party; \xe2\x80\x9cso would the fact that [the former] has orange hair.\xe2\x80\x9d  at 9.  But that is an example of wit gone wrong.  Whether the purchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial to the statutory scheme.  By contrast, whether the purchaser has transacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute\xe2\x80\x94because, as previously noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. controls access to weapons\xe2\x80\x9d through the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is \xe2\x80\x9cthe principal agent of federal enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d   v. ,\n; see  at 16.  In so designing the statute, Congress chose not to pursue the goal of \xe2\x80\x9ccontroll[ing] access\xe2\x80\x9d to guns to the nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute\xe2\x80\x99s background check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun second-hand.

Abramski made a false statement when he claimed to be the gun\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactual transferee/buyer\xe2\x80\x9d as Form 4473 defined that term.  But that false statement was not \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial to the lawfulness of the sale\xe2\x80\x9d since the truth\xe2\x80\x94that Abramski was buying the gun for his uncle with his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s money\xe2\x80\x94would not have made the sale unlawful.

Most prominently, the Act provides that no one may \xe2\x80\x9csell or otherwise dispose of\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm to a person who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one of nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives, illegal-drug users, and the mentally ill).  \xc2\xa7922(d).  But the Government does not contend that either Abramski or his uncle fell into one of those prohibited categories.  And no provision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to receive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying a gun for another person who is eligible to receive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s uncle), even at the other\xe2\x80\x99s request and with the other\xe2\x80\x99s money.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s false statement was material to the lawfulness of the sale depends on a strained interpretation of provisions that mention the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom a dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer[s],\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver[s]\xe2\x80\x9d) a gun.

And he may not \xe2\x80\x9csell or deliver\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe resides in a different State.  \xc2\xa7922(b)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Government maintains that in this case Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s uncle was the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9cs[old]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun, and that the sale consequently violated those provisions.  It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun Control Act implicitly incorporates \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of agency law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 17.  Under those principles, it contends, the individual who walks into a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s store, fills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes possession of the gun is not necessarily the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun.  Instead, it says, we must ask whether that individual bought the gun as a third party\xe2\x80\x99s common-law agent; if so, then the third party is the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun within the meaning of the relevant statutory provisions.  The majority agrees: Although it never explicitly mentions agency law, it declares that if an individual is \xe2\x80\x9cbuying a firearm on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s behalf,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9csomeone else\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun within the meaning of the statute.

That is of no moment, however, because Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s uncle was not the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the gun was \xe2\x80\x9cs[old].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The contrary interpretation provided by the Government and the majority founders on the plain language of the Act.  We interpret criminal statutes, like other statutes, in a manner consistent with ordinary English usage.  Flores-Figueroa v. United States,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646\n\xe2\x80\x93652 (2009); Jones v. United States,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n855 (2000)\n; Bailey v. United States,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137\n\xe2\x80\x93145 (1995).  In ordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an item of merchandise to the person who physically appears in his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes possession of it.  So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say that the store \xe2\x80\x9csells\xe2\x80\x9d the milk and eggs to me.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  And even if we were prepared to let \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of agency law\xe2\x80\x9d trump ordinary English usage in the interpretation of this criminal statute, those principles would not require a different result.  See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7366, Illustration 1 (1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cOn behalf of P, his disclosed principal, A makes a written contract with T wherein A prom-ises to buy from T, and T agrees to sell to A, certain machin-ery for $1000. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

United States,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 814 (1974)\n, on which the majority relies, ante, at 14, does not suggest otherwise.  There we addressed the types of transactions covered by the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cacquisition\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) (a term whose meaning is not at issue here), holding that they were not limited to \xe2\x80\x9csale-like transaction[s]\xe2\x80\x9d but included a \xe2\x80\x9cpawnshop redemption of a firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 819.  We said nothing about the distinct question of to whom a dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer[s],\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm in a given transaction.  Nor does the case stand, as the majority believes, for \xe2\x80\x9ca substance-over-form approach,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14.  We said the term \xe2\x80\x9cacquisition\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98aimed at providing maximum coverage,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid. (quoting 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 826\xe2\x80\x93827), not because substance over form demands that, nor because everything in the Act must be assumed to provide maximum coverage, but because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98acquire\xe2\x80\x99 is defined to mean simply \xe2\x80\x98to come into possession, control, or power of disposal of,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which gives \xe2\x80\x9cno intimation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that title or ownership would be necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 820.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cmerely raises, rather than answers, the critical question\xe2\x80\x9d of whether Abramski or his uncle was the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9cs[old]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun, ante, at 9, the statute speaks to that question directly.  Giving the text its plain, ordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  That being so, the Government has identified no reason why the arrangement between Abramski and his uncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess firearms, was \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial to the lawfulness of\xe2\x80\x9d the sale.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority contends, however, that the Gun Control Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ccurb[ing] crime by keeping firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them\xe2\x80\x9d demands the conclusion that Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s uncle was the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9cs[old]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun.  Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But \xe2\x80\x9cno law pursues its purpose at all costs,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9ctextual limitations upon a law\xe2\x80\x99s scope\xe2\x80\x9d are equally \xe2\x80\x9ca part of its \xe2\x80\x98purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Rapanos v.

That vastly overstates the consequences.  Perhaps the statute would serve the purpose of crime prevention more effectively if the requirements at issue looked past the \xe2\x80\x9cman at the counter\xe2\x80\x9d to the person \xe2\x80\x9cgetting, and always meant to get, the fire-arm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  But ensuring that the person taking possession of the firearm from the dealer is eligible to receive and possess a firearm, and recording information about that person for later reference, are by no means worthless functions.  On the contrary, they indisputably advance the purpose of crime prevention by making it harder for ineligible persons to acquire guns and easier for the Government to locate those guns in the future; they simply do not advance that purpose to the same degree as a more exacting law might have done.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That the Act\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the \xe2\x80\x9cman at the counter\xe2\x80\x9d in this situation does not render its requirements \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless\xe2\x80\x9d is confirmed by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concession that the Act has a similar focus in many comparable situations where the gun\xe2\x80\x99s immediate purchaser is\xe2\x80\x94to use the majority\xe2\x80\x99s phrase\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cmere condui[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for a contemplated transfer of the gun to a different person who will \xe2\x80\x9ctake possession of, own, and use\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Ante, at 11, 16.  Consider the following scenarios in which even the Government regards the man at the counter as the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the gun:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Guns Intended as Gifts.

The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position makes no exception for situations where the gift is specifically requested by the recipient (as gifts sometimes are).

The Government\xe2\x80\x99s concession that the statute is operating appropriately in each of those scenarios should cause the majority to reevaluate its assumptions about the type and degree of regulation that the statute regards as \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority, it is clear, regards Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation as creating a loophole in the law; but even if that were a fair characterization, why is the majority convinced that a statute with so many admitted loopholes does not contain this particular loophole?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this argument is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual who sends a straw to a gun store to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but the most formal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16 (emphasis deleted).  That certainly distinguishes that individual from the intended subsequent donee or purchaser; so would the fact that he has orange hair.  But it does not establish why that individual, any more than the others, should be thought to be covered by statutory language (the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom a dealer \xe2\x80\x9csell[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a gun) that does not naturally apply.

Perhaps that is because Congress wanted a rule that would be easy to understand and to administer, which the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed agency test\xe2\x80\x94and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s apparent adoption of that test sans any mention of agency law\xe2\x80\x94certainly is not.  (When counsel for the Government was pressed about hypothetical situations not gift-wrapped as neatly as this case, he said, frankly but unhelpfully, that they would turn on the \xe2\x80\x9cfactual question\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether the purchase was made on behalf of someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 49\xe2\x80\x9350.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Or perhaps Congress drew the line where it did because the Gun Control Act, like many contentious pieces of legislation, was a \xe2\x80\x9ccompromise\xe2\x80\x9d among \xe2\x80\x9chighly interested parties attempting to pull the provisions in different directions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnhart v.

After Congress passed the Act in 1968, ATF\xe2\x80\x99s initial position was that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an eligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an ineligible one).

Ante, at 22.  But the fact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read it, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the type of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that interpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable and does not make its requirements \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambiguous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar principle\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Skilling v. United States,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358,\n410 (2010)\n.  That principle prevents us from giving the words of a criminal statute \xe2\x80\x9ca meaning that is different from [their] ordinary, accepted meaning, and that disfavors the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Burrage v. United States, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12).  And it means that when a criminal statute has two possible readings, we do not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98choose the harsher alternative\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d unless Congress has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98spoken in language that is clear and definite.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Bass,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336\n\xe2\x80\x93349 (1971).  For the reasons given above, it cannot be said that the statute unambiguously commands the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current reading.  It is especially contrary to sound practice to give this criminal statute a meaning that the Government itself rejected for years.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart from a footnote, ante, at 18, n.\xc2\xa010, responding to this dis-sent.  The footnote concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe text creates some ambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d but says that \xe2\x80\x9ccontext, structure, history, and purpose resolve it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But for the reasons given above, context and structure do not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, history refutes it by showing that the Government itself interpreted the statute more leniently for many years, and \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d supports it only if one imputes to the statute a crime-fighting purpose broader than the text discloses (a practice that would nullify the rule of lenity in all cases).  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, supra.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  If lenity has no role to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to stop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s miserly approach, the rule of lenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of interpretation have been exhausted, \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable doubt persists\xe2\x80\x9d regarding whether Congress has made the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v. United States,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,\n108 (1990)\n\xe2\x80\x94in other words, whenever those tools do not decisively dispel the statute\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguity.

It cannot honestly be said that the text, structure, and history of the Gun Control Act establish as \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously correct\xe2\x80\x9d that the Act makes Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s conduct a federal crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        By refusing to apply lenity here, the majority turns its back on a liberty-protecting and democracy-promoting rule that is \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not much less old than construction itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.); see, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 88 (1765) (\xe2\x80\x9cPenal statutes must be construed strictly\xe2\x80\x9d).  As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, the rule is \xe2\x80\x9cfounded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wiltberger, supra, at 95.  It forbids a court to criminalize an act simply because the court deems that act \xe2\x80\x9cof equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 96.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s majority disregards that foundational principle.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II. Section 924(a)(1)(A)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse statement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of\xe2\x80\x9d a federally licensed gun dealer (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his chapter\xe2\x80\x9d refers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code, which contains the Gun Control Act.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7921\xe2\x80\x93931.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The question Abramski answered falsely was whether he was buying the gun for someone else.  Did the Act itself require the dealer to record this information?  It did not; it simply required him to record \xe2\x80\x9cthe name, age, and place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to whom the firearm was \xe2\x80\x9cs[old] or deliver[ed].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7922(b)(5).  As explained above, that \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d was Abramski, not his uncle.  See Part I, supra.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98maintain such records .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22 (quoting \xc2\xa7923(g)(1)(A)).  So did a regulation require this information to be recorded?  Again, no.  The relevant regulation provides that a dealer shall</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cobtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the transferee\xe2\x80\x99s name, sex, residence address (including county or similar political subdivision), date and place of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the transferee\xe2\x80\x99s country of citizenship; the transferee\xe2\x80\x99s INS-issued alien number or admission number; the transferee\xe2\x80\x99s State of residence; and certification by the transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  27 CFR \xc2\xa7478.124(c)(1) (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The long list of information that this regulation requires to be kept in the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s records does not include whether the transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the regulation requires a dealer to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98retain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as part of [its] required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d selling or disposing of a firearm.  Ante, at 23 (quoting 27 CFR \xc2\xa7478.124(a)).  Therefore, according to the majority, any \xe2\x80\x9cfalse answer on that Form\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even an answer to a question that is not among those enumerated in the regulation\xe2\x80\x94necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cpertains to information a dealer is statutorily required to maintain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 23.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far.  On the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime.  That is not what the statute says.  The statute punishes misstatements \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to information required to be kept,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cinformation contained in forms required to be kept.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because neither the Act nor any regulation requires a dealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchasing a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that question had no place on Form 4473\xe2\x80\x94any more than would the question whether the customer was purchasing the gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who that individual was.  And the statute no more criminalizes a false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473 than it criminalizes the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s volunteering of a false e-mail address on that form.  Information regarding Abramski\xe2\x80\x99s status as a \xe2\x80\x9cstraw purchaser\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9cinformation required to be kept,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is an end of the matter.  In my view, that is the best\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the only plausible\xe2\x80\x94interpretation of \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A).  But at a minimum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93C, supra.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner.  Whether or not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress enacted do not support it\xe2\x80\x94especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of the accused.  I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Sections 922(b)(5), (c), and (t)(1) require the dealer to follow certain procedures with respect to that \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d such as recording his name, dealing with him in person, and checking his background.  I doubt whether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures (here, by applying them to the wrong person) is  within the meaning of \xc2\xa7922(a)(6) if the sale could have been executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed.  Moreover, if that were so\xe2\x80\x94if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale were  material to lawfulness\xe2\x80\x94then \xc2\xa7924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in Part II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with respect to information required to be recorded in a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s records, would be superfluous.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would be different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of groceries.   at 9, n.\xc2\xa05.
