JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the validity of 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 233.100(a)(1) (1976), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 432 U. S. 418</a></p><p> Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) pursuant to a delegation of rulemaking authority in \xc2\xa7 407(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 607(a). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The issue is whether the regulation is a proper exercise of the Secretary\'s statutory authority.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The statute is contained in the Social Security Act\'s Title IV, which has to do primarily with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).  The AFDC program was established by the Act in 1935 to provide welfare payments where children are needy because of the death, absence, or incapacity of a parent.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 606(a).  The original conception of AFDC was to allow widows and divorced mothers to care for their children at home without having to go to work, thus eliminating the practice of removing needy children in situations of that kind to institutions.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/575/case.html">Burns v. Alcala,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 432 U. S. 419</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/575/case.html">420 U.

AFDC was not originally designed to assist children who are needy simply because the family breadwinner is unable to find work; it was contemplated that other programs would alleviate that problem by attacking unemployment directly.  <em>See Carleson v. Remillard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/598/case.html">406 U. S. 598</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/598/case.html#603">406 U. S. 603</a></span> (1972); <em>King v.

Other parts of the Act encouraged the establishment of state unemployment compensation programs, primarily through tax incentives, but the federal role in these programs is not so great as in AFDC.  <em>See Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/471/case.html">431 U. S. 471</a></span> (1977).</p>\n<p>Title IV was amended in 1961 to add \xc2\xa7 407. Pub.L. 87-31, \xc2\xa7 1, 75 Stat. 75.  This section established an experimental program (AFDC-UF) [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] to provide assistance in some cases where the unemployment of a parent causes dependent children to be needy.  The States were given broad power to define "unemployment" for purposes of the program and to determine the relationship of this new program to existing state unemployment compensation plans.  In 1968, the AFDC-UF program was made permanent, 81 Stat. 882, but the eligibility criteria were modified to withdraw some of the definitional authority delegated to the States.   The statute now requires a participating State to provide assistance where a needy child</p>\n<p>"has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) of his father."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 607(a).  <em>See Philbrook v. Glodgett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/707/case.html">421 U.

States that elect to participate in these programs administer them under federal standards and HEW supervision.  Funding is provided from state and federal revenues on a matching basis.  <em>See, e.g., Shea v. Vialpando,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/251/case.html">416 U.

Although every State currently participates in AFDC, only about half the States participate in the AFDC-UF program.  Dept. of HEW, Public Assistance Statistics, Oct.1976, table 5, p. 9 (1977).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The instant case originated in 1971 as a challenge to Rule 200.X.(A)(2) of the Maryland Department of Employment and Social Services.  That Rule denies AFDC-UF benefits to families where the father is out of work for reasons that disqualify him for state unemployment insurance compensation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 432 U. S. 421</a></p><p> The original plaintiffs represented two classes of families with dependent children who were thereby ineligible for AFDC-UF benefits:  one where the father had been discharged for misconduct (excessive absenteeism), and the other where the father was out of work because of a strike.  The defendants were Maryland officials having responsibility for the administration of public assistance grants in the State.  A three-judge United States District Court was convened to consider the claim that Rule 200.X.(A)(2) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court sustained the constitutionality of the state regulation, but went on to hold it invalid because it was contrary to the federal regulation prescribing standards for the determination of unemployment under the AFDC-UF program.  <em>Francis v. Davidson,</em> 340 F. Supp. 351 (Md.), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 409 U. S. 904 (1972) (<em>Francis I</em>).  Although HEW did not agree that its regulation was inconsistent with Rule 200.X.(A)(2), the Solicitor General, in his memorandum for the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> filed in <em>Francis I</em> at this Court\'s invitation, 408 U. S. 920 (1972), suggested a summary affirmance in that case in light of the then-forthcoming revision of the HEW regulation.</p>\n<p>The HEW regulation, as amended, expressly authorizes some state discretion in defining unemployment.  Generally, it requires the States to consider a person to be unemployed for AFDC-UF purposes if he works less than 100 hours a month, except for intermittent employment, and</p>\n<p>"except that, at the option of the State, such definition need not include a father whose unemployment results from participation in a labor dispute or who is unemployed by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 432 U. S. 422</a></p><p> for unemployment compensation under the State\'s unemployment compensation law."</p>\n<p>45 CFR \xc2\xa7233.100(a)(1) (1976).  The Secretary had stated that the purpose of this amendment was to nullify the effect of <em>Francis I</em> by making explicit the HEW policy of allowing the States to exclude AFDC-UF participants based on the particular reason that the father was out of work. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 432 U. S. 423</a></p><p></p>\n<p>After the amended HEW regulation became effective, the defendant Maryland officials moved that the District Court dissolve its earlier injunction issued March 16, 1972, after <em>Francis I</em> had been decided, against enforcement of Rule 200.X.(A)(2).  That court recognized that "[t]he conflict between the federal and the Maryland regulation ended after the former was amended," but nevertheless it denied the motion and continued the injunction on the ground that the amended federal regulation now was in conflict with the federal statute.  <em>Francis v. Davidson,</em> 379 F.Supp. 78, 81 (Md.1974) (<em>Francis II</em>).  First, with regard to the class of fathers discharged for misconduct, the District Court stated that these people are necessarily "unemployed," within the meaning of the statute, and that any contrary regulation is invalid.  Second, the court recognized that it is not clear whether the statutory term "unemployed" includes persons involved in a labor dispute.  The court held, however, that the HEW regulation was invalid in this regard because it delegated the question of coverage to the States without providing a uniform national standard.  <em>Id.</em> at 81-82.</p>\n<p>After this Court dismissed a direct appeal in <em>Francis II</em> for want of jurisdiction, 419 U.S. 1042 (1974), appeals were taken by the state defendants and by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, as intervenor, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  There the case was consolidated with an appeal in a similar case, <em>Bethea v. Mason,</em> 384 F.Supp. 1274 (Md 1974), where a single District Judge had followed <em>Francis II</em> in holding the same HEW regulation invalid insofar as it authorized the State to deny AFDC-UF benefits to fathers who had voluntarily quit their previous jobs.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Circuit affirmed the three appeals in an unpublished per curiam adopting the respective opinions of the two District Judges.  <em>See</em> 529 F.2d 514 and 515 (1975).  The state defendants petitioned for certiorari, contending that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 432 U. S. 424</a></p><p> current HEW regulation is authorized by the federal statute and that the injunction against the state regulation therefore should be dissolved. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Solicitor General, at the invitation of the Court, 425 U.S. 969 (1976), filed a memorandum for the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> supporting the state defendants\' position.  We granted certiorari.  429 U.S. 939 (1976).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The ultimate question in this case is whether the statutory term "unemployment" may be interpreted to allow the State to exclude the three classes of respondents from receiving AFDC-UF benefits.  There can be no doubt that 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 233.100(a)(1) (1976) embodies that interpretation.  Thus, the actual issue we must decide is not how the statutory term should be interpreted, but whether the Secretary\'s regulation is proper.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, administrative interpretations of statutory terms are given important, but not controlling, significance.  This was the Court\'s approach, for example, when it had under consideration the question whether the term "wages" in Title II of the Social Security Act included a backpay award.  <em>Social Security Board v. Nierotko,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/358/case.html">327 U. S. 358</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/358/case.html#369">327 U. S. 369</a></span> (1946). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 432 U. S. 425</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Unlike the statutory term in Title II, however, Congress in \xc2\xa7 407(a) expressly delegated to the Secretary the power to prescribe standards for determining what constitutes "unemployment" for purposes of AFDC-UF eligibility.  In a situation of this kind, Congress entrust to the Secretary, rather than to the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term.  In exercising that responsibility, the Secretary adopts regulations with legislative effect.  A reviewing court is not free to set aside those regulations simply because it would have interpreted the statute in a different manner.  <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/232/case.html">299 U. S. 232</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/232/case.html#235">299 U. S. 235</a></span>-237 (1936). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 432 U. S. 426</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The regulation at issue in this case is therefore entitled to more than mere deference or weight.  It can be set aside only if the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority or if the regulation is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."  5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 706(2)(A), (C). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We turn now to the grounds on which the District Courts and the Court of Appeals held the regulation invalid, keeping in mind the narrow scope of review that is indicated in this situation.</p>\n<p>These courts held that the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority to prescribe standards, in the first place, because he permitted the determination of eligibility to turn in part on the reason for the father\'s unemployment.  The language of \xc2\xa7 407(a) was thought to make the only relevant consideration that of whether, not why, the father was out of work:</p>\n<p>"\'A man out of work because he was discharged for cause by his employer <em>is unemployed.</em>  There can be no two ways about that conclusion.\' . . .  [N]o combination of federal and state regulations may provide that a father who is unemployed is not unemployed."</p>\n<p><em>Francis II,</em> 379 F.Supp. at 81, quoting <em>Francis I,</em> 340 F.Supp. at 366.  And in <em>Bethea,</em> the court by like reasoning held that a person who voluntarily quit his job is to be considered unemployed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 432 U. S. 427</a></p><p> within the meaning of the statute.  384 F.Supp. at 1280-1281.</p>\n<p>We do not agree that the statutory language is so unambiguous.  The term "unemployment" is often used in a specialized context where its meaning is other than simply not having a job.  For example, the concept of unemployment is frequently limited to persons who have some connection with the workforce, that is, individuals who desire to work and are capable of working, and who, usually but not always, have held jobs in the past.  In addition, the feature of involuntariness is often linked with unemployment.  Limitations of this nature are found in the definitions used by the Depart ment of Labor in compiling unemployment statistics. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  State unemployment compensation programs generally confine their benefits in this manner. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Indeed, the other provisions of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 432 U. S. 428</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 407 impose similar limitations, indicating that the AFDC-UF program was not intended to provide assistance without regard to the reason a person is out of work. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that the statutory term is capable of more than the tautological definition imposed by the District Judges and the Court of Appeals.  Congress itself must have appreciated that the meaning of the statutory term was not self-evident, or it would not have given the Secretary the power to prescribe standards.</p>\n<p>Respondents argue, however, that Congress intended that the Secretary prescribe an "hours-worked" standard for determining unemployment but did not intend any further additions to the eligibility criteria specified in other provisions of the statute.  In fact, a minimum hours-worked standard is part of the regulation at issue in this case, but there is no indication in the statutory language or legislative history that Congress intended to foreclose other factors in the determination of what constitutes unemployment for purposes of the AFDC-UF program.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Secretary\'s statutory authority to prescribe standards is not unlimited.  He could not, for example, adopt a regulation that bears no relationship to any recognized concept of unemployment or that would defeat the purpose of the AFDC-UF program.  But the regulation here at issue does not even approach these limits of the delegated authority.  By allowing the States to exclude persons who would be disqualified under the State\'s unemployment compensation law, the Secretary has incorporated a well known and widely applied standard for "unemployment."  Exclusion of individuals who are out of work as a result of their own conduct and thus disqualified from state unemployment compensation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 432 U. S. 429</a></p><p> is consistent with the goal of AFDC-UF, namely, to aid the families of the involuntarily unemployed. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  On the other hand, state unemployment benefits are ordinarily available only after a waiting period and only for a limited number of weeks or months.  By providing benefits during the periods before and after state unemployment compensation is available, AFDC-UF fills a significant gap in social insurance coverage. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Thus, we cannot say that the Secretary\'s regulation defeats the purpose of the AFDC-UF program.</p>\n<p>We therefore hold that the HEW regulation, to the extent it allows the States to determine that persons disqualified under unemployment compensation laws are not "unemployed" under \xc2\xa7 407(a), is within the statutory authority delegated to the Secretary, and is reasonable.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The second stated reason for the District Judges\' and Court of Appeals\' holding that the Secretary\'s regulation was invalid was that it permitted the States the option of denying unemployment compensation benefits to participants in a labor dispute. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Although the holding is not entirely clear to us, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 432 U. S. 430</a></p><p> appears that what was regarded as fatal was the Secretary\'s failure to impose sufficient standards to control the States\' decisions under this optional feature. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Presumably, the same rationale would provide an alternative basis for holding the regulation invalid to the extent it allows States the uncontrolled option of denying benefits to persons who were discharged for cause or had voluntarily quit their jobs.</p>\n<p>It is clear that a major purpose of the 1968 amendment was to retract some of the authority previously delegated to the States under \xc2\xa7 407(a).  <em>Philbrook v. Glodgett,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/707/case.html#710">421 U. S. 710</a></span>.  We, however, do not think this shift of authority from the States to the Secretary required the Secretary to adopt a regulation that precludes any recognition of local policies.  If Congress had intended such a result, it might have changed the statutory language from "unemployment (as defined by the State)" to "unemployment (as defined by the Secretary)."  Instead, \xc2\xa7 407(a) now reads "unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary)."  The power to "determine" unemployment remains with the States, and we conclude that the power to prescribe "standards" gives the Secretary sufficient flexibility to recognize some local options in determining AFDC-UF eligibility.</p>\n<p>The legislative history, we acknowledge, is at some variance with the statutory language.  The effect of the 1968 amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 432 U. S. 431</a></p><p> is described as to "provide for a uniform definition of unemployment throughout the United States," and as to "authorize a Federal definition of unemployment by the Secretary."  S.Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-4, 160 (1967).  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 544, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 3, 17, 108 (1967); 113 Cong.Rec. 32592 (1967) (remarks of Sen. Long).  We do not understand these comments to mean, however, that the Secretary is prohibited from allowing the States any options in determining whether or not a person is "unemployed" for purposes of the AFDC-UF program.  First, the legislative history cannot be read literally in its claim that the amended statute itself provides a federal definition of unemployment; at best, the statute delegates to the Secretary the power to prescribe such a definition.  Second, we have no quarrel with the statements in the legislative history that the Secretary is <em>authorized</em> to adopt such a uniform definition; we simply hold that he is not <em>required</em> to do so.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the congressional purpose was to promote greater uniformity in the applicability of the AFDC-UF program.  But the goal of greater uniformity can be met without imposing identical standards on each State.  In one case, for example, a State was permitted to adopt a somewhat more liberal hours-worked test than the minimum required by the Secretary.  <em>Macias v. Finch,</em> 324 F.Supp. 1252 (ND Cal.), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 400 U.S. 913 (1970).  We conclude, therefore, that the Secretary\'s approach in the present case is not contrary to the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is reinforced by our understanding of the AFDC-UF program as involving the concept of cooperative federalism.  The States are free not to participate in the program, and, as we have noted, only about half of them in fact do so.  The congressional purpose is not served at all in those States where AFDC-UF is totally unavailable.  Accordingly, we should not lightly infer a congressional intention to preclude the Secretary from recognizing legitimate local </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 432 U. S. 432</a></p><p> policies in determining eligibility.  <em>See New York Dept. of Soc. Services v. Dublino,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/405/case.html">413 U.

Accordingly, \xc2\xa7 407(b)(2)(C)(ii) was held to establish a nationwide test of eligibility under which only the actual "receipt" of unemployment compensation would preclude AFDC-UF benefits.  Thus, the States were required to allow persons eligible for both programs to refuse unemployment compensation and receive AFDC-UF benefits instead.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/707/case.html#713">421 U.

Maryland\'s Unemployment Insurance Law specifics various grounds that disqualify otherwise eligible individuals from receiving benefits.  These grounds include, among others, voluntarily leaving work without good cause, gross misconduct, discharge or suspension as a disciplinary measure (temporary disqualification for not less than one week and for not more than nine weeks), and certain work stoppages due to labor disputes other than lockouts.

Both alternatives would amend \xc2\xa7 233.100(a)(1), which provides a Federal deifinition of unemployed father under the AFDC program in terms of hours of work."</p>\n<p>"In applying the existing regulation, the Department policy has been to permit a State, at its option, to use a definition of unemployed father which imposes additional conditions relating to the reason for the unemployment, <em>e.g.,</em> the State definition might exclude a father whose unemployment results from participation in a labor dispute or who is unemployed by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the State\'s unemployment compensation law.  In <em>Davidson v. Francis,</em> the U. S. Supreme Court, on October 16, summarily affirmed the judgment of the district court which held, in effect, that while the Secretary has broad authority to define an unemployed father for purposes of section 407 of the Social Security Act, the existing Federal regulation provides only an hours-of-work test, and thus prohibits a State from excluding fathers who meet this test but are disqualified for unemployment compensation."</p>\n<p>"Accordingly, the proposed alternative A below would amend the regulation to make the prior Department policy explicit, by stating the options which are permitted to the States in defining an unemployed father.  Alternative B, on the other hand, would amend the regulation to make clear that the hours-of-work test is intended as the exclusive definition of unemployed father, so that States may not have definitions which impose added conditions.

Except as such interpretive power may be included in the agencies\' administrative functions, Congress did neither.  An agency may not finally decide the limits of its statutory power.  That is a judicial function.  Congress used a well understood word -- \'wages\' -- to indicate the receipts which were to govern taxes and benefits under the Social Security Act.

This understates the case; literally all of the relevant legislative history repeatedly and unequivocally affirms the strong congressional objective of creating a federal definition of unemployment.  It is common ground that Congress changed the wording of \xc2\xa7 407(a) from "unemployment (as defined by the State)" to "unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary)" for the express purpose of "eliminat[ing] the variations in state definitions of unemployment."  <em>Philbrook v.

S. 435</a></p><p> who are needy because their fathers are unemployed].  But the differences between State programs are great.  States may define unemployment as narrowly or broadly as they wish, requiring substantial previous work experience or no work experience.  This variation in definition of unemployment is shown clearly by three adjacent Southwestern States, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado.  Each of these States has a population of between 1 and 2 million, yet, in Arizona, only 19 families of unemployed parents received AFDC in May, while, during the same month, there were 880 in Utah and 1,600 in Colorado.  Arizona\'s narrow definition of unemployment has kept its program to a token level."</p>\n<p>"The House bill continues to allow States to choose whether they will include dependent children of unemployed parents under AFDC.  But for the first time, the House will set a <em>Federal definition of unemployment.

The members of the Senate Finance Committee expressed no doubt as to the meaning of the Undersecretary\'s remarks:  "Senator WILLIAMS:  I notice you say you are in complete agreement that there should be a <em>Federal definition of unemployment.</em>"  <em>Id.</em> at 269 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Finally, after the enactment of the 1968 amendments, the Senate Finance Committee was unequivocal in summing up the amendments to the unemployed fathers provisions:  "The amendments provide for a <em>Federal definition of unemployment</em> for States which have AFDC-UF programs."

S. 436</a></p><p> Prior Law 3 (July 15, 1968) (emphasis added). <em>See also id.</em> at 63 ("Unemployment will be defined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare"); 113 Cong.Rec. 23054 (1967) (remarks of Rep.

S.Rep. No. 744, <em>supra</em> at 4; H.R.Rep. No. 544, <em>supra</em> at 3.  While I agree with the majority that this Court should defer to any reasonable definition given by the Secretary to the term "unemployment," I cannot agree, in light of the legislative history, that the Secretary may simply delegate the responsibility for defining that term to the States, for in important respects this would simply return the law to the situation existing prior to the amendment defining that term to the States.  Here, the Secretary has promulgated a regulation describing a rather broad category of individuals who may be eligible for AFDC-UF benefits but has then permitted the States to include or exclude those individuals from eligibility "at the option of the State."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 432 U. S. 437</a></p><p> Contrary to the obvious intent of Congress, this leaves to state discretion the coverage of important categories of claimants and invites the very diversity in coverage that the 1968 amendment was designed to prevent.  I cannot believe that this regulation conforms to the statutory purpose.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>* The Court appears to believe that the statutory language supports its view that the States are still free to define the eligibility criteria for AFDC-UF benefits; but the statute provides that "unemployment" will be "determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the <em>Secretary,</em>" not the States.  (Emphasis added.)  The Court concludes that the statutory language contemplates that unemployment will be "determined" by the States, and that only the "standards" will be determined by the Secretary.  The majority suggests that, if Congress had intended for the Secretary to define unemployment, it would have used the words "unemployment (as defined by the Secretary)."  The Court\'s paper-thin distinction between "determining" unemployment and prescribing "standards" totally escapes me.  Moreover, according to the Court\'s logic, if Congress had intended the meaning suggested by the majority, it would have provided that unemployment would be "determined by the States in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary"; instead, Congress eliminated all references to the States.  The common sense meaning of the statutory language is that "unemployment" is to be defined by the Secretary, and, as we shall see, the statute is susceptible of no other interpretation when read in the context of the legislative history.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
