Only the weightiest considerations, however, would warrant such action by a Circuit Justice.  <em>New York v. Kleppe,</em> 429 U.S. 1307, 1310 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers); <em>O\'Rourke v. Levine,</em> 80 S.Ct. 623, 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 615, 616 (1960) (Harlan, J., in chambers).</p>\n<p>I have examined the transcript of the hearing held by the District Judge at 8:30 p.m. on January 15, 1983, in New Orleans, the order issued after the hearing forbidding the broadcast by CBS in the Dallas area of a particular segment of a designated program, the order issued by a divided panel of the Court of Appeals staying the District Court\'s order, and the application to me to vacate the stay of the Court of Appeals.  I am not myself convinced that the Court of Appeals was in error in issuing the stay; and I do not think that, if the application were before the full Court, five Justices would vote to vacate the stay.  Accordingly, I deny the application to vacate the stay.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
