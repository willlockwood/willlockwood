Such an appeal may allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the CSRA itself; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by a federal statute.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77702(a)(1).  When an employee alleges that a personnel action appealable to the MSPB was based on discrimination, her case is known as a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed case.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302.

If the agency decides against the employee, she may either appeal the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the MSPB or sue the agency in district court.  Alternatively, the employee can bypass the agency and bring her mixed case directly to the MSPB.  If the MSPB upholds the personnel action, whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so, the employee is entitled to seek judicial review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 7703(b)(1) of the CSRA provides that petitions for review of MSPB decisions \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed in the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Following applicable EEOC regulations, DOL completed an internal investigation and report, and Kloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge.  While the EEOC case was pending, Kloeckner was fired.  Because Kloeckner believed that DOL\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire her was based on unlawful discrimination, she now had a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kloeckner originally brought her mixed case directly to the MSPB.  Concerned about duplicative discovery expenses between her EEOC and MSPB cases, she moved to amend her EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward.  Both motions were granted.  In September 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal without prejudice to her right to refile by January 18, 2007.  The EEOC case, however, continued until April 2007, when the EEOC judge terminated the proceeding as a sanction for Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s bad-faith discovery conduct and returned the case to DOL for a final decision.  In October, DOL ruled against Kloeckner on all of her claims.  Kloeckner appealed to the Board in November 2007.  The Board dismissed Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal as untimely, viewing it as an effort to reopen her old MSPB case months after the January 18 deadline.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination.  The court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  It held that, because the MSPB dismissed Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s claims on procedural grounds, she should have sought review in the Federal Circuit under \xc2\xa77703(b)(1); in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to \xc2\xa77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in \xc2\xa77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not the Federal Circuit, regardless whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural grounds or on the merits.

Begin with \xc2\xa7 7703, which governs judicial review of MSPB rulings.  Section 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 7703(b)(2) then provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed under\xe2\x80\x9d the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute.  Each of the referenced enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d shall be filed in district court.  Turn next to \xc2\xa77702, which provides that the cases \xe2\x80\x9csubject to [its] provisions\xe2\x80\x9d are cases in which a federal employee \xe2\x80\x9chas been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by\xe2\x80\x9d a listed federal statute.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination subject to\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77702 are therefore mixed cases.  Putting \xc2\xa77703 and \xc2\xa77702 together, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.  That is where Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s case should have been, and indeed was, filed.  Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or threw it out as untimely, she brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes to district court.

See \xc2\xa77702(a)(1).  The question presented in this case arises when the MSPB dismisses an appeal alleging discrimination not on the merits, but on procedural grounds.  Should an employee seeking judicial review then file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or instead bring a suit in district court under the applicable antidiscrimination law?

That statutory framework provides graduated procedural protections depending on an action\xe2\x80\x99s severity.  If (but only if) the action is particularly serious\xe2\x80\x94involving, for example, a removal from employment or a reduction in grade or pay\xe2\x80\x94the affected employee has a right to appeal the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the MSPB, an independent adjudicator of federal employment disputes.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71204, 7512, 7701.  Such an appeal may merely allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the CSRA; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by another federal statute, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e et\xc2\xa0seq., or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 et\xc2\xa0seq.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77702(a)(1).  When an employee complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB and alleges that the action was based on discrimination, she is said (by pertinent regulation) to have brought a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed case.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302 (2012).  The CSRA and regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) set out special procedures to govern such a case\xe2\x80\x94different from those used when the employee either challenges a serious personnel action under the CSRA alone or attacks a less serious action as discriminatory.

She may first file a discrim- ination complaint with the agency itself, much as an employee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to the MSPB could do.  See 5 CFR \xc2\xa71201.154(a); 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302(b).  If the agency decides against her, the employee may then either take the matter to the MSPB or bypass further administrative review by suing the agency in district court.  See 5 CFR \xc2\xa71201.154(b); 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302(d)(1)(i).  Alternatively, the employee may initiate the process by bringing her case directly to the MSPB, forgoing the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own system for evaluating discrimination charges.  See 5 CFR \xc2\xa71201.154(a); 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302(b).  If the MSPB upholds the personnel action (whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so), the employee again has a choice: She may request additional administrative process, this time with the EEOC, or else she may seek judicial review.

In June 2005, while still an employee, she filed a complaint with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in unlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work environment.  At that point, Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s case was not appealable to the MSPB because she had not suffered a sufficiently serious personnel action (e.g., a removal or demotion).  See supra, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Her claim thus went forward not under the special procedures for mixed cases, but under the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations for all other charges of discrimination.  See 29 CFR pt. 1614, subpts. A, D.  In line with those rules, the agency completed an internal investigation and report in June 2006, and Kloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe next month, DOL fired Kloeckner.  A removal from employment is appealable to the MSPB, see supra, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and Kloeckner believed the agency\xe2\x80\x99s action was discriminatory; she therefore now had a mixed case.  As permitted by regulation, see supra, at 3, she initially elected to file that case with the MSPB.  Her claim of discriminatory removal, however, raised issues similar to those in her hostile work environment case, now pending before an EEOC judge; as a result, she became concerned that she would incur duplicative discovery expenses.  To address that problem, she sought leave to amend her EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal, and she asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward.

In April, the EEOC judge found that Kloeckner had engaged in bad-faith conduct in connection with discovery.  As a sanction, the judge terminated the EEOC proceeding and returned Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s case to DOL for a final decision.  Six months later, in October 2007, DOL issued a ruling rejecting all of Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.

That appeal was filed within 30 days, the usual window for seeking MSPB review of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination of a mixed case.  See 5 CFR \xc2\xa71201.154(a); 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302(d)(1)(ii).  But the MSPB declined to treat Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s filing as an ordinary appeal of such an agency decision.  Instead, the Board viewed it as an effort to reopen her old MSPB case\xe2\x80\x94many months after the January 18 deadline for doing so had expired.  The Board therefore dismissed Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal as untimely.  See App. 53\xe2\x80\x9357.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  See Kloeckner v. Solis, Civ. Action No. 4:09CV804 (ED Mo., Feb. 18, 2010).  Relying on the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in Brumley v. Levinson, 991 F.\xc2\xa02d 801 (1993) (per\xc2\xa0curiam), the court held that because the MSPB had dismissed Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s claims on procedural grounds, she should have sought review in the Federal Circuit under \xc2\xa77703(b)(1); in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to \xc2\xa77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed on the same reasoning.  See 639 F.\xc2\xa03d 834 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), to resolve a Circuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial review should proceed in the Federal Circuit or in a district court when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We now reverse the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the above account reveals, the intersection of fed- eral civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced a complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving claims of discrimination in the federal workplace.  But even within the most intricate and complex systems, some things are plain.  So it is in this case, where two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeckner to district court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBegin with \xc2\xa77703, which governs judicial review of the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s rulings.  As already noted, see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, \xc2\xa77703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Paragraph (2), i.e., \xc2\xa77703(b)(2), then sets out a different rule for one category of cases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a case, paragraph (2) instructs, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed under\xe2\x80\x9d the enforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimination statute.  And each of those enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  So \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702\xe2\x80\x9d shall be filed in district court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTurn next to \xc2\xa77702, which identifies the cases \xe2\x80\x9csubject to [its] provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  As also stated earlier, \xc2\xa77702(a)(1) de- scribes cases in which a federal employee \xe2\x80\x9c(A) has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by\xe2\x80\x9d a listed federal statute.  The subsection thus describes what we (adopting the lingo of the applicable regulations) have called \xe2\x80\x9cmixed cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302.  Those are the \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination subject to\xe2\x80\x9d the rest of \xc2\xa77702\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNow just put \xc2\xa77703 and \xc2\xa77702 together\xe2\x80\x94say, in the form of a syllogism, to make the point obvious.  Under \xc2\xa77703(b)(2), \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d shall be filed in district court.  Under \xc2\xa77702(a)(1), the \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d are mixed cases\xe2\x80\x94those appealable to the MSPB and alleging discrimination.  Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd so that is where Kloeckner\xe2\x80\x99s case should have been filed (as indeed it was).  No one here contests that Kloeckner brought a mixed case\xe2\x80\x94that she was affected by an action (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB and that she alleged discrimination prohibited by an enumerated fed- eral law.  And under the CSRA\xe2\x80\x99s terms, that is all that matters.  Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or instead threw it out as untimely, Kloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes, in crystalline fashion, to district court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government offers an alternative view (as did the Eighth Circuit)\xe2\x80\x94that the CSRA directs the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s merits decisions to district court, while channeling its procedural rulings to the Federal Circuit.  According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not prescribed in the CSRA in so many words, lies hidden in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s timing requirements.  But we return from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mazelike tour of the CSRA persuaded only that the merits-procedure distinction is a contrivance, found nowhere in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s provisions on judicial review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument has two necessary steps.  First, the Government claims that \xc2\xa77703(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction applies only when the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s decision in a mixed case is a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially review- able action\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77702.  Second, the Government asserts that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of a mixed case on procedural grounds does not qualify as such a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  We describe in turn the way the Government arrives at each of these conclusions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first step of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument derives from \xc2\xa77703(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence.  Right after stating that \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d shall be filed under specified antidiscrimination statutes (i.e., shall be filed in district court), \xc2\xa77703(b)(2) provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed under any such [statute] must be filed within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under section 7702.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government reads that sentence to establish an ad- ditional prerequisite for taking a case to district court, instead of to the Federal Circuit.  To fall within the \xc2\xa77703(b)(2) exception, the Government says, it is not enough that a case qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccase of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x9d; in addition, the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s decision must count as a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  If the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a phrase the Government characterizes as a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art in this context,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x94the ruling still may be subject to judicial review (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense), but only in the Federal Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s second step\xe2\x80\x94that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s pro- cedural rulings are not \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable actions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94begins with the language of \xc2\xa77702(a)(3).  That provision, the Government states, \xe2\x80\x9cdefines for the most part which MSPB decisions qualify as \xe2\x80\x98judicially reviewable actions[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cproviding that \xe2\x80\x98[a]ny decision of the Board under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action as of\xe2\x80\x99 the date of the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting \xc2\xa77702(a)(3); emphasis and brackets added by Government).  From there, the Govern- ment moves on to the cross-referenced paragraph\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa77702(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94which states, among other things, that the Board \xe2\x80\x9cshall, within 120 days of [the employee\xe2\x80\x99s filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s appellate procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the Government, the Board only \xe2\x80\x9cdecide[s] . . . the issue of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d when it rules on the merits, rather than on procedural grounds.  On that view, a procedural decision is not in fact a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision of the Board under paragraph (1),\xe2\x80\x9d which means that it also is not a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77702(a)(3).  See Brief for Respondent 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  And so (returning now to the first step of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument), judicial review of a procedural decision can occur only in the Federal Circuit, and not in district court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf you need to take a deep breath after all that, you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone.  It would be hard to dream up a more round- about way of bifurcating judicial review of the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s rulings in mixed cases.  If Congress had wanted to send merits decisions to district court and procedural dismissals to the Federal Circuit, it could just have said so.  The Government has offered no reason for Congress to have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd taking the Government\xe2\x80\x99s analysis one step at a time makes it no more plausible than as a gestalt.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s initial move is to read \xc2\xa77703(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence as adding a requirement for a case to fall within the exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction.  But that sentence does no such thing; it is nothing more than a filing deadline.  Consider each sentence of \xc2\xa77703(b)(2) in turn.  The first sentence defines which cases should be brought in district court, rather than in the Federal Circuit; here, the full description is \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to wit, mixed cases.  The second sentence then states when those cases should be brought: \xe2\x80\x9cany such case .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must be filed within 30 days\xe2\x80\x9d of the date the employee \xe2\x80\x9creceived notice of the judicially reviewable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  The reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action\xe2\x80\x9d in that sentence does important work: It sets the clock running for when a case that belongs in district court must be filed there.  What it does not do is to further define which timely-brought cases belong in dis- trict court instead of in the Federal Circuit.  Describing those cases is the first sentence\xe2\x80\x99s role.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tProof positive that the Government misreads \xc2\xa77703(b)(2)  comes from considering what the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cju- dicially reviewable action\xe2\x80\x9d would mean under its theory.  In normal legal parlance, to say that an agency action is not \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable\xe2\x80\x9d is to say simply that it is not subject to judicial review\xe2\x80\x94that, for one or another reason, it cannot be taken to a court.  But that ordinary understanding will not work for the Government here, because it wants to use the phrase to help determine which of two courts should review a decision, rather than whether judicial review is available at all.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternate universe, then, to say that an agency action is not \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable\xe2\x80\x9d is to say that it is subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit (even though not in district court).  Small wonder that the Government must call the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art,\xe2\x80\x9d supra, at 9:  On a natural reading, the phrase defines cases amenable to judicial review, rather than routes those cases as between two courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd even were we to indulge the Government that far, we could not accept the second step of its analysis.  At that stage, remember, the Government contends that under \xc2\xa77702 only decisions on the merits qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The language on which the Government principally relies, stated again, is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Board shall, within 120 days of [the employee\xe2\x80\x99s filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that provision, too, is only a timing requirement; it is designed to ensure that the Board act promptly on employees\xe2\x80\x99 complaints.  We see no reason to think that embedded within that directive is a limitation on the class of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor (even were we to indulge the Government on that point as well) can we find the particular restriction the Government urges.  According to the Government, the MSPB does not \xe2\x80\x9cdecide .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the issue of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d when it dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds.  But that phrase cannot bear the weight the Government places on it.  All the phrase signifies is that the Board should dispose of the issue in some way, whether by actually adjudicating it or by holding that it was not properly raised.  Indeed, were the Government right, \xc2\xa77702(a)\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the Board \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d decide the issue of discrimination would appear to bar procedural dismissals, requiring the Board to resolve on the merits even untimely complaints.  No one (least of all the Government, which here is defending a procedural ruling) thinks that a plausible congressional command.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother section of the statute\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa77702(e)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x94puts the final nail in the coffin bearing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  That section states: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f at any time after the 120th day following [an employee\xe2\x80\x99s filing] with the Board .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , there is no judicially reviewable action[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an employee shall be entitled to file a civil action\xe2\x80\x9d in district court under a listed antidiscrimination statute.  That provision, as the Government notes, is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto save employees from being held in perpetual uncertainty by Board inaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 28.  But if, as the Government insists, a procedural ruling is not a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable action,\xe2\x80\x9d then the provision would have another, surprising effect\xe2\x80\x94essentially blowing up the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument from the inside.  In that event, an employee whose suit the Board had dismissed on procedural grounds could bring suit in district court under 7702(e)(1)(B) (so long as 120 days had elapsed from her Board filing), because she would have received \xe2\x80\x9cno judicially reviewable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, she could do so even many years later, because the statute\xe2\x80\x99s usual 30-day filing deadline begins to run only upon \xe2\x80\x9cnotice of [a] judicially reviewable action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77703(b)(2).  So an argument intended to keep employees like Kloeckner out of district court would paradoxically, and nonsensically, result in giving them all the time in the world to file suit there.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tResponding to this unwelcome outcome, the Government offers us an exit route: We should avoid \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd results,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government urges, by applying \xc2\xa77702(e)(1)(B) only to \xe2\x80\x9ccases over which the Board continues to exert jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 27, 28, n.\xc2\xa04.  But as the Government admits, that \xe2\x80\x9cgloss on the statute is not found in the text,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50; the Government\xe2\x80\x99s remedy requires our reading new words into the statute.  We think a better option lies at hand.  If we reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s odd view of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially reviewable actions,\xe2\x80\x9d then no absurdity arises in the first place: \xc2\xa77702(e)(1)(B) would have no bearing on any case the MSPB dismissed within 120 days, whatever the grounds.  It is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own misreading that creates the need to \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77702(e)(1)(B); take that away and the provision serves, as it was intended, only as a remedy for Board inaction.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in \xc2\xa77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit.

We have previously recognized that Congress, through the CSRA, sought to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary layer[s] of judicial review in lower federal courts, and encourag[e] more consistent judicial decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Fausto, \n (internal quotation marks and some bracketing omitted).  But in this case, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument about the necessity of Federal Circuit review runs into an inconvenient fact: When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal Circuit did not exist, and \xc2\xa77703(b)(1) thus provided, as the general rule, that a federal employee should appeal a Board decision to 1 of the 12 Courts of Appeals or the Court of Claims.  See Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, \n.  Moreover, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own approach would leave many cases involving federal employment issues in district court.  If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit will come to district court for a decision on both questions.  See Williams v. Department of Army, 715 F. 2d 1485, 1491 (CA Fed. 1983) (en banc).  In any event, even the most formidable argument concerning the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
