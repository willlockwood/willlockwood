Perich accepted the call and was designated a commissioned minister.

In January 2005, she notified the school principal that she would be able to report to work in February.  The principal responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher to fill Perich\xe2\x80\x99s position for the remainder of the school year.  The principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.  The congregation subsequently offered to pay a portion of Perich\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance premiums in exchange for her resignation as a called teacher.  Perich refused to resign.  In February, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until she received written documentation that she had reported to work.  The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be fired.  Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and intended to assert her legal rights.  In a subsequent letter, the chairman of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting.  As grounds for termination, the letter cited Perich\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinsubordination and disruptive behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the damage she had done to her \xe2\x80\x9cworking relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with the school by \xe2\x80\x9cthreatening to take legal action.\xe2\x80\x9d  The congregation voted to rescind Perich\xe2\x80\x99s call, and Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Invoking what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception,\xe2\x80\x9d Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the \n \nFirst Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded.  It recognized the existence of a ministerial exception rooted in the \n \nFirst Amendment, but concluded that Perich did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cminister\xe2\x80\x9d under the exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the \n \nFirst Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in that area confirm that it is impermissible for the government to contradict a church\xe2\x80\x99s determination of who can act as its ministers.  See Watson v.

The Court agrees that there is such a ministerial exception.  Requiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision.  Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs.  By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group\xe2\x80\x99s right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.  According the state the power to determine which individuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich contend that religious organizations can defend against employment discrimination claims by invoking their \n \nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association.  They thus see no need\xe2\x80\x94and no basis\xe2\x80\x94for a special rule for ministers grounded in the Religion Clauses themselves.  Their position, however, is hard to square with the text of the \n \nFirst Amendment itself, which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations.  The Court cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to select its own ministers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich also contend that Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872\n, precludes recognition of a ministerial exception.  But Smith involved government regulation of only outward physical acts.  The present case, in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.

The Court, however, does not adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister.  Here, it is enough to conclude that the exception covers Perich, given all the circumstances of her employment.  Hosanna-Tabor held her out as a minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members.  That title represented a significant degree of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning.  Perich also held herself out as a minister by, for example, accepting the formal call to religious service.  And her job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church\xe2\x80\x99s message and carrying out its mission: As a source of religious instruction, Perich played an important part in transmitting the Lutheran faith.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn concluding that Perich was not a minister under the exception, the Sixth Circuit committed three errors.  First, it failed to see any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister.  Although such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same religious duties as Perich.  Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions\xe2\x80\x94particularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.  Third, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perich\xe2\x80\x99s performance of secular duties.  Although the amount of time an employee spends on particular activities is relevant in assessing that employee\xe2\x80\x99s status, that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the other considerations discussed above.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Because Perich was a minister for purposes of the exception, this suit must be dismissed.  An order reinstating Perich as a called teacher would have plainly violated the Church\xe2\x80\x99s freedom under the Religion Clauses to select its own ministers.  Though Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, she continues to seek frontpay, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  An award of such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the \n \nFirst Amendment than an order overturning the termination.  Such relief would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by the ministerial exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAny suggestion that Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s asserted religious reason for firing Perich was pretextual misses the point of the ministerial exception.  The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.  The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control who will minister to the faithful is the church\xe2\x80\x99s alone.

One way of doing so is by completing a \xe2\x80\x9ccolloquy\xe2\x80\x9d program at a Lutheran college or university.  The program requires candidates to take eight courses of theological study, obtain the endorsement of their local Synod district, and pass an oral examination by a faculty committee.

The EEOC and Perich sought Perich\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement to her former position (or frontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and other injunctive relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment.  Invoking what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception,\xe2\x80\x9d the Church argued that the suit was barred by the \n \nFirst Amendment because the claims at issue concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers.  According to the Church, Perich was a minister, and she had been fired for a religious reason\xe2\x80\x94namely, that her threat to sue the Church vio-lated the Synod\xe2\x80\x99s belief that Christians should resolve their disputes internally.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court agreed that the suit was barred by the ministerial exception and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s favor.

In 1215, the issue was addressed in the very first clause of Magna Carta.  There, King John agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe English church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.\xe2\x80\x9d  The King in particular accepted the \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of elections,\xe2\x80\x9d a right \xe2\x80\x9cthought to be of the greatest necessity and importance to the English church.\xe2\x80\x9d  J.

See, e.g., W. Warren, Henry II 312 (1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the electors of a bishopric in Winchester, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cI order you to hold a free election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard my clerk\xe2\x80\x9d).  In any event, it did not survive the reign of Henry VIII, even in theory.  The Act of Supremacy of 1534, 26 Hen.\xc2\xa08, ch.\xc2\xa01, made the English monarch the supreme head of the Church, and the Act in Restraint of Annates, 25 Hen. 8, ch.\xc2\xa020, passed that same year, gave him the authority to appoint the Church\xe2\x80\x99s high officials.  See G. Elton, The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary 331\xe2\x80\x93332 (1960).  Various Acts of Uniformity, enacted subsequently, tightened further the government\xe2\x80\x99s grip on the exercise of religion.  See, e.g., Act of Uniformity, 1559, 1 Eliz., ch.\xc2\xa02; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2 &amp; 3 Edw.\xc2\xa06, ch.\xc2\xa01.  The Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service as a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed tenets and pledged to follow the mode of worship set forth in the Book of Common Prayer.  Any minister who refused to make that pledge was \xe2\x80\x9cdeprived of all his Spiritual Promotions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car.\xc2\xa02, ch.\xc2\xa04.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeeking to escape the control of the national church, the Puritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect their own ministers and establish their own modes of worship.  See T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and State in America to the Passage of the \n \nFirst Amendment 3 (1986); McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1409, 1422 (1990).  William Penn, the Quaker proprietor of what would eventually become Pennsylvania and Delaware, also sought independence from the Church of England.  The charter creating the province of Pennsylvania contained no clause establishing a religion.  See S. Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 440\xe2\x80\x93441 (1970).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tColonists in the South, in contrast, brought the Church of England with them.  But even they sometimes chafed at the control exercised by the Crown and its representatives over religious offices.  In Virginia, for example, the law vested the governor with the power to induct ministers presented to him by parish vestries, 2 Hening\xe2\x80\x99s Statutes at Large 46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make such presentations and instead chose ministers on their own.  See H. Eckenrode, Separation of Church and State in Virginia 13\xe2\x80\x9319 (1910).  Controversies over the selection of ministers also arose in other Colonies with Anglican establishments, including North Carolina.  See C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom from Federal Establishment: Formation and Early History of the \n \nFirst Amendment Religion Clauses 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (1964).  There, the royal governor insisted that the right of presentation lay with the Bishop of London, but the colonial assembly enacted laws placing that right in the vestries.  Authorities in England intervened, repealing those laws as inconsistent with the rights of the Crown.  See id., at 11; Weeks, Church and State in North Carolina, Johns Hopkins U.

Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church.  See 1 Annals of Cong. 730\xe2\x80\x93731 (1789) (noting that the Establishment Clause addressed the fear that \xe2\x80\x9cone sect might obtain a pre-eminence, or two combine together, and establish a religion to which they would compel others to conform\xe2\x80\x9d (remarks of J. Madison)).  By forbidding the \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment of religion\xe2\x80\x9d and guaranteeing the \xe2\x80\x9cfree exercise thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d the Religion Clauses ensured that the new Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94unlike the English Crown\xe2\x80\x94would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices.  The Establishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their own.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis understanding of the Religion Clauses was reflected in two events involving James Madison, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the leading architect of the religion clauses of the \n \nFirst Amendment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.

The first occurred in 1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the United States, solicited the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on who should be appointed to direct the affairs of the Catholic Church in the territory newly acquired by the Louisiana Purchase.  After consulting with President Jefferson, then-Secretary of State Madison responded that the selection of church \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionaries\xe2\x80\x9d was an \xe2\x80\x9centirely ecclesiastical\xe2\x80\x9d matter left to the Church\xe2\x80\x99s own judgment.  Letter from James Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20, 1806), reprinted in 20 Records of the American Catholic Historical Society 63 (1909).  The \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulous policy of the Constitution in guarding against a political interference with religious affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d Madison explained, prevented the Government from rendering an opinion on the \xe2\x80\x9cselection of ecclesiastical individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second episode occurred in 1811, when Madison was President.  Congress had passed a bill incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria in what was then the District of Columbia.  Madison vetoed the bill, on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9cexceeds the rightful authority to which Governments are limited, by the essential distinction between civil and religious functions, and violates, in particular, the article of the Constitution of the United States, which declares, that \xe2\x80\x98Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  22 Annals of Cong. 982\xe2\x80\x93983 (1811).

This Court touched upon the issue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over church property.  Our decisions in that area confirm that it is impermissible for the government to contradict a church\xe2\x80\x99s determination of who can act as its ministers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679 (1872), the Court considered a dispute between antislavery and proslavery factions over who controlled the property of the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky.  The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had recognized the antislavery faction, and this Court\xe2\x80\x94applying not the Constitution but a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad and sound view of the relations of church and state under our system of laws\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94declined to question that determination.  Id., at 727.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever the questions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of [the] church judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Ibid.  At issue in Kedroff was the right to use a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City.  The Russian Orthodox churches in North America had split from the Supreme Church Authority in Moscow, out of concern that the Authority had become a tool of the Soviet Government.  The North American churches claimed that the right to use the cathedral belonged to an archbishop elected by them; the Supreme Church Authority claimed that it belonged instead to an archbishop appointed by the patriarch in Moscow.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s highest court ruled in favor of the North American churches, based on a state law requiring every Russian Orthodox church in New York to recognize the determination of the governing body of the North American churches as authoritative.

By \xe2\x80\x9cpass[ing] the control of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one church authority to another,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York law intruded the \xe2\x80\x9cpower of the state into the forbidden area of reli- gious freedom contrary to the principles of the First Amend-ment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 119.  Accordingly, we declared the law unconstitutional because it \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly prohibit[ed] the free exercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church\xe2\x80\x99s choice of its hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court reaffirmed these \n \nFirst Amendment principles in Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696 (1976)\n, a case involving a dispute over control of the American-Canadian Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, including its property and assets.  The Church had removed Dionisije Milivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese because of his defiance of the church hierarchy.  Following his removal, Dionisije brought a civil action in state court challenging the Church\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and the Illinois Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cpurported in effect to reinstate Dionisije as Diocesan Bishop,\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that the proceedings resulting in his removal failed to comply with church laws and regulations.

When ecclesiastical tribunals decide such disputes, we further explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution requires that civil courts accept their decisions as binding upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 725.  We thus held that by inquiring into whether the Church had followed its own procedures, the State Supreme Court had \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionally undertaken the resolution of quintessentially religious controversies whose resolution the \n \nFirst Amendment commits exclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals\xe2\x80\x9d of the Church.

The Courts of Appeals, in contrast, have had extensive experience with this issue.  Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e et\xc2\xa0seq., and other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence of a \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception,\xe2\x80\x9d grounded in the \n \nFirst Amendment, that precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe agree that there is such a ministerial exception.  The members of a religious group put their faith in the hands of their ministers.  Requiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision.  Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs.  By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group\xe2\x80\x99s right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.  According the state the power to determine which individuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich acknowledge that employment discrimination laws would be unconstitutional as applied to religious groups in certain circumstances.  They grant, for example, that it would violate the \n \nFirst Amendment for courts to apply such laws to compel the ordination of women by the Catholic Church or by an Orthodox Jewish seminary.  Brief for Federal Respondent 31; Brief for Respondent Perich 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  According to the EEOC and Perich, religious organizations could successfully defend against employment discrimination claims in those circum-stances by invoking the constitutional right to freedom of association\xe2\x80\x94a right \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit\xe2\x80\x9d in the \n \nFirst Amendment.  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609, \n622 (1984)\n.  The EEOC and Perich thus see no need\xe2\x80\x94and no basis\xe2\x80\x94for a special rule for ministers grounded in the Religion Clauses themselves.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe find this position untenable.  The right to freedom of association is a right enjoyed by religious and secular groups alike.  It follows under the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s and Perich\xe2\x80\x99s view that the \n \nFirst Amendment analysis should be the same, whether the association in question is the Lutheran Church, a labor union, or a social club.  See Perich Brief 31; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  That result is hard to square with the text of the \n \nFirst Amendment itself, which gives spe-cial solicitude to the rights of religious organizations.  We cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to select its own ministers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich also contend that our decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872 (1990)\n, precludes recognition of a ministerial exception.  In Smith, two members of the Native American Church were denied state unemployment benefits after it was determined that they had been fired from their jobs for ingesting peyote, a crime under Oregon law.  We held that this did not violate the Free Exercise Clause, even though the peyote had been ingested for sacramental purposes, because the \xe2\x80\x9cright of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true that the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on retaliation, like Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability.  But a church\xe2\x80\x99s selection of its ministers is unlike an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ingestion of peyote.  Smith involved government regulation of only outward physical acts.  The present case, in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.  See id., at 877 (distinguishing the government\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical acts\xe2\x80\x9d from its \xe2\x80\x9clend[ing] its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma\xe2\x80\x9d).  The contention that Smith forecloses recognition of a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses has no merit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving concluded that there is a ministerial exception grounded in the Religion Clauses of the \n \nFirst Amendment, we consider whether the exception applies in this case.

We are reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister.  It is enough for us to conclude, in this our first case involving the ministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich, given all the circumstances of her employment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin with, Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members.  When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it issued her a \xe2\x80\x9cdiploma of vocation\xe2\x80\x9d according her the title \xe2\x80\x9cMinister of Religion, Commissioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.\xc2\xa042.  She was tasked with performing that office \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the Word of God and the confessional standards of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as drawn from the Sacred Scriptures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The congregation prayed that God \xe2\x80\x9cbless [her] ministrations to the glory of His holy name, [and] the building of His church.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 43.  In a supplement to the diploma, the congregation undertook to periodically review Perich\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cskills of ministry\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cministerial responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d and to provide for her \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing education as a professional person in the ministry of the Gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 49.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerich\xe2\x80\x99s title as a minister reflected a significant degree of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning.  To be eligible to become a commissioned minister, Perich had to complete eight college-level courses in subjects including biblical interpretation, church doctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran teacher.  She also had to obtain the endorsement of her local Synod district by submitting a petition that contained her academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, personal statement, and written answers to various ministry-related questions.  Finally, she had to pass an oral examination by a faculty committee at a Lutheran college.  It took Perich six years to fulfill these requirements.  And when she eventually did, she was commissioned as a minister only upon election by the congregation, which recognized God\xe2\x80\x99s call to her to teach.  At that point, her call could be rescinded only upon a supermajority vote of the congregation\xe2\x80\x94a protection designed to allow her to \xe2\x80\x9cpreach the Word of God boldly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod as Amicus Curiae 15.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerich held herself out as a minister of the Church by accepting the formal call to religious service, according to its terms.  She did so in other ways as well.  For example, she claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that was available only to employees earning their compensation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the exercise of the ministry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 220 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not conducting activities \xe2\x80\x98in the exercise of the ministry,\xe2\x80\x99 you cannot take advantage of the parsonage or housing allowance exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod Brochure on Whether the IRS Considers Employees as a Minister (2007)).  In a form she submitted to the Synod following her termination, Perich again indicated that she regarded herself as a minister at Hosanna-Tabor, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that God is leading me to serve in the teaching ministry .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. I am anxious to be in the teaching ministry again soon.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.\xc2\xa053.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerich\xe2\x80\x99s job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church\xe2\x80\x99s message and carrying out its mission.  Hosanna-Tabor expressly charged her with \xe2\x80\x9clead[ing] others toward Christian maturity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cteach[ing] faithfully the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as set forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 48.  In fulfilling these responsibilities, Perich taught her students religion four days a week, and led them in prayer three times a day.  Once a week, she took her students to a school-wide chapel service, and\xe2\x80\x94about twice a year\xe2\x80\x94she took her turn leading it, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and delivering a short message based on verses from the Bible.  During her last year of teaching, Perich also led her fourth graders in a brief devotional exercise each morning.  As a source of religious instruction, Perich performed an important role in transmitting the Lutheran faith to the next generation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of these considerations\xe2\x80\x94the formal title given Perich by the Church, the substance reflected in that title, her own use of that title, and the important religious functions she performed for the Church\xe2\x80\x94we conclude  that Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals committed three errors.  First, the Sixth Circuit failed to see any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister.  Although such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position.  It was wrong for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94and Perich, who has adopted the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, see Perich Brief 45\xe2\x80\x94to say that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s title does not matter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same religious duties as Perich.  We express no view on whether someone with Perich\xe2\x80\x99s duties would be covered by the ministerial exception in the absence of the other considerations we have discussed.  But though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions\xe2\x80\x94particularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perich\xe2\x80\x99s performance of secular duties.  It is true that her religious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each workday, and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching secular subjects.  The EEOC regards that as conclusive, contending that any ministerial exception \xe2\x80\x9cshould be limited to those employees who perform exclusively religious functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondent 51.  We cannot accept that view.  Indeed, we are unsure whether any such employees exist.  The heads of congregations themselves often have a mix of duties, including secular ones such as helping to manage the congregation\xe2\x80\x99s finances, supervising purely secular personnel, and overseeing the upkeep of facilities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the Sixth Circuit did not adopt the extreme position pressed here by the EEOC, it did regard the relative amount of time Perich spent performing religious functions as largely determinative.  The issue before us, however, is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch.  The amount of time an employee spends on particular activities is relevant in assessing that employee\xe2\x80\x99s status, but that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the nature of the religious functions performed and the other considerations discussed above.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause Perich was a minister within the meaning of the exception, the \n \nFirst Amendment requires dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against her religious employer.  The EEOC and Perich originally sought an order reinstating Perich to her former position as a called teacher.  By requiring the Church to accept a minister it did not want, such an order would have plainly violated the Church\xe2\x80\x99s freedom under the Religion Clauses to select its own ministers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerich no longer seeks reinstatement, having abandoned that relief before this Court.  See Perich Brief 58.  But that is immaterial.  Perich continues to seek frontpay in lieu of reinstatement, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  An award of such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the \n \nFirst Amendment than an order overturning the termination.  Such relief would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by the ministerial exception.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich suggest that Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s asserted religious reason for firing Perich\xe2\x80\x94that she violated the Synod\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to internal dispute resolution\xe2\x80\x94was pretextual.  That suggestion misses the point of the ministerial exception.  The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.  The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control who will minister to the faithful\xe2\x80\x94a matter \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly ecclesiastical,\xe2\x80\x9d Kedroff, 344 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 119\xe2\x80\x94is the church\xe2\x80\x99s alone.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe EEOC and Perich foresee a parade of horribles that will follow our recognition of a ministerial exception to employment discrimination suits.  According to the EEOC and Perich, such an exception could protect religious organizations from liability for retaliating against employees for reporting criminal misconduct or for testifying before a grand jury or in a criminal trial.  What is more, the EEOC contends, the logic of the exception would confer on religious employers \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered discretion\xe2\x80\x9d to violate employment laws by, for example, hiring children or aliens not authorized to work in the United States.

Nor, according to the Church, would the exception bar government enforcement of general laws restricting eligibility for employment, because the exception applies only to suits by or on behalf of ministers themselves.  Hosanna-Tabor also notes that the ministe-rial exception has been around in the lower courts for 40 years, see McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F.\xc2\xa02d 553, 558 (CA5 1972), and has not given rise to the dire consequences predicted by the EEOC and Perich.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe case before us is an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister, challenging her church\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire her.  Today we hold only that the ministerial exception bars such a suit.  We express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cminister\xe2\x80\x9d is commonly used by many Protestant denominations to refer to members of their clergy, but the term is rarely if ever used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In addition, the concept of ordination as understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism has no clear counterpart in some Christian denominations and some other religions.  Because virtually every religion in the world is represented in the population of the United States, it would be a mistake if the term \xe2\x80\x9cminister\xe2\x80\x9d or the concept of ordination were viewed as central to the important issue of religious autonomy that is presented in cases like this one.  Instead, courts should focus on the function performed by persons who work for religious bodies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFirst Amendment protects the freedom of religious groups to engage in certain key religious activities, including the conducting of worship services and other religious ceremonies and rituals, as well as the critical process of communicating the faith.

If a religious group believes that the ability of such an employee to perform these key functions has been compromised, then the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom protects the group\xe2\x80\x99s right to remove the employee from his or her position.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThroughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, religious bodies have been the preeminent example of private associations that have \xe2\x80\x9cact[ed] as critical buffers between the individual and the power of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609, \n619 (1984)\n.  In a case like the one now before us\xe2\x80\x94where the goal of the civil law in question, the elimination of discrimination against persons with disabilities, is so worthy\xe2\x80\x94it is easy to forget that the autonomy of religious groups, both here in the United States and abroad, has often served as a shield against oppressive civil laws.  To safeguard this crucial autonomy, we have long recognized that the Religion Clauses protect a private sphere within which religious bodies are free to govern themselves in accordance with their own beliefs. The Constitution guarantees religious bodies \xe2\x80\x9cindependence from secular control or manipulation\xe2\x80\x94in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d Kedroff v.

Different religions will have different views on exactly what qualifies as an important religious position, but it is nonetheless possible to identify a general category of \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d whose functions are essential to the independence of practically all religious groups.  These include those who serve in positions of leadership, those who perform important functions in worship services and in the performance of religious ceremonies and rituals, and those who are entrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the faith to the next generation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying the protection of the \n \nFirst Amendment to roles of religious leadership, worship, ritual, and expression focuses on the objective functions that are important for the autonomy of any religious group, regardless of its beliefs.  As we have recognized in a similar context, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]orcing a group to accept certain members may impair [its ability] to express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express.\xe2\x80\x9d  Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, \n\n530 U. S. 640, \n648 (2000)\n.  That principle applies with special force with respect to religious groups, whose very existence is dedicated to the collective expression and propagation of shared religious ideals. See Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872, \n882 (1990)\n (noting that the constitutional interest in freedom of association may be \xe2\x80\x9creinforced by Free Exercise Clause concerns\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court notes, the \n \nFirst Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cgives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, but our expressive-association cases are nevertheless useful in pointing out what those essential rights are.  Religious groups are the archetype  of associations formed for expressive purposes, and their fundamental rights surely include the freedom to choose who is qualified to serve as a voice for their faith.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen it comes to the expression and inculcation of religious doctrine, there can be no doubt that the messenger matters.  Religious teachings cover the gamut from moral conduct to metaphysical truth, and both the content and credibility of a religion\xe2\x80\x99s message depend vitally on the character and conduct of its teachers.  A religion cannot depend on someone to be an effective advocate for its religious vision if that person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fails to live up to the religious precepts that he or she espouses.  For this reason, a religious body\xe2\x80\x99s right to self-governance must include the ability to select, and to be selective about, those who will serve as the very \xe2\x80\x9cembodiment of its message\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cits voice to the faithful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462 F.\xc2\xa03d 294, 306 (CA3 2006).  A religious body\xe2\x80\x99s control over such \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d is an essential component of its freedom to speak in its own voice, both to its own members and to the outside world.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe connection between church governance and the free dissemination of religious doctrine has deep roots in our legal tradition:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe right to organize voluntary religious associations to assist in the expression and dissemination of any religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for the decision of controverted questions of faith within the association, and for the ecclesiastical government of all the individual members, congregations, and officers within the general association, is unquestioned.  All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this government, and are bound to submit to it.  But it would be a vain consent and would lead to the total subversion of such religious bodies, if any one aggrieved by one of their decisions could appeal to the secular courts and have them reversed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Watson v.

But while a ministe-rial title is undoubtedly relevant in applying the \n \nFirst Amendment rule at issue, such a title is neither necessary nor sufficient.  As previously noted, most faiths do not employ the term \xe2\x80\x9cminister,\xe2\x80\x9d and some eschew the concept of formal ordination.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And at the opposite end of the spectrum, some faiths consider the ministry to consist of all or a very large percentage of their members.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Perhaps this explains why, although every circuit to consider the issue has recognized the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial\xe2\x80\x9d exception, no circuit has made ordination status or formal title determinative of the exception\xe2\x80\x99s applicability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Fourth Circuit was the first to use the term \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception,\xe2\x80\x9d but in doing so it took pains to clarify that the label was a mere shorthand.  See Rayburn v. General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 772 F.\xc2\xa02d 1164, 1168 (1985) (noting that the exception\xe2\x80\x99s applicability \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not depend upon ordination but upon the function of the position\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Fourth Circuit traced the exception back to McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F.\xc2\xa02d 553 (CA5 1972), which invoked the Religion Clauses to bar a Title VII sex-discrimination suit brought by a woman who was described by the court as a Salvation Army \xe2\x80\x9cminister,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 554, although her actual title was \xe2\x80\x9cofficer.\xe2\x80\x9d  See McClure v. Salvation Army, 323 F. Supp. 1100, 1101 (ND Ga. 1971). A decade after McClure, the Fifth Circuit made clear that formal ordination was not necessary for the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial\xe2\x80\x9d exception to apply.  The court held that the members of the faculty at a Baptist seminary were covered by the exception because of their religious function in conveying church doctrine, even though some of them were not ordained ministers.  See EEOC v. Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, 651 F.\xc2\xa02d 277 (1981).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe functional consensus has held up over time, with the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ministerial exception has not been limited to members of the clergy.\xe2\x80\x9d  EEOC v. Catholic Univ., 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 455, 461 (1996).  The court in that case rejected a Title VII suit brought by a Catholic nun who claimed that the Catholic University of America had denied her tenure for a canon-law teaching position because of her gender.  The court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cmembers of the Canon Law Faculty perform the vital function of instructing those who will in turn interpret, implement, and teach the law governing the Roman Catholic Church and the administration of its sacraments.  Although Sister McDonough is not a priest, she is a member of a religious order who sought a tenured professorship in a field that is of fundamental importance to the spiritual mission of her Church.\xe2\x80\x9d Id., at 464.

Christian and Missionary Alliance, 878 F.\xc2\xa02d 1575, 1578 (CA1 1989) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9ca religious organization\xe2\x80\x99s fate is inextricably bound up with those whom it entrusts with the responsibilities of preaching its word and ministering to its adherents,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulties inherent in separating the message from the messenger\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit too has taken a functional approach, just recently reaffirming that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ministerial exception encompasses more than a church\xe2\x80\x99s ordained ministers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Alcazar v. Corp. of Catholic Archbishop of Seattle, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 1288, 1291 (2010) (en banc); see also Elvig v. Calvin Presbyterian Church, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d 951, 958 (2004).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today should not be read to upset this consensus.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe ministerial exception applies to respondent because, as the Court notes, she played a substantial role in \xe2\x80\x9cconveying the Church\xe2\x80\x99s message and carrying out its mission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  She taught religion to her students four days a week and took them to chapel on the fifth day. She led them in daily devotional exercises, and led them in prayer three times a day.  She also alternated with the other teachers in planning and leading worship services at the school chapel, choosing liturgies, hymns, and read-ings, and composing and delivering a message based on Scripture.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt makes no difference that respondent also taught secular subjects.  While a purely secular teacher would not qualify for the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial\xe2\x80\x9d exception, the constitutional protection of religious teachers is not somehow diminished when they take on secular functions in addition to their religious ones.  What matters is that respondent played an important role as an instrument of her church\xe2\x80\x99s religious message and as a leader of its worship activities.  Because of these important religious functions, Hosanna-Tabor had the right to decide for itself whether respondent was religiously qualified to remain in her office.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHosanna-Tabor discharged respondent because she threatened to file suit against the church in a civil court.  This threat contravened the Lutheran doctrine that disputes among Christians should be resolved internally without resort to the civil court system and all the legal wrangling it entails.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s view, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disregard for this doctrine compromised her religious function, disqualifying her from serving effectively as a voice for the church\xe2\x80\x99s faith.  Respondent does not dispute that the Lutheran Church subscribes to a doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but she argues that this was a mere pretext for her firing, which was really done for nonreligious reasons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor civil courts to engage in the pretext inquiry that respondent and the Solicitor General urge us to sanction would dangerously undermine the religious autonomy that lower court case law has now protected for nearly four decades.  In order to probe the real reason for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s firing, a civil court\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps a jury\xe2\x80\x94would be required to make a judgment about church doctrine.  The credibility of Hosanna-Tabor\xe2\x80\x99s asserted reason for terminating respondent\xe2\x80\x99s employment could not be assessed without taking into account both the importance that the Lutheran Church attaches to the doctrine of internal dispute resolution and the degree to which that tenet compromised respondent\xe2\x80\x99s religious function.  If it could be shown that this belief is an obscure and minor part of Lutheran doctrine, it would be much more plausible for respondent to argue that this doctrine was not the real reason for her firing.  If, on the other hand, the doctrine is a central and universally known tenet of Lutheranism, then the church\xe2\x80\x99s asserted reason for her discharge would seem much more likely to be nonpretextual.  But whatever the truth of the matter might be, the mere adjudication of such questions would pose grave problems for religious autonomy:  It would require calling witnesses to testify about the importance and priority of the religious doctrine in question, with a civil factfinder sitting in ultimate judgment of what the accused church really believes,  and how important that belief is to the church\xe2\x80\x99s overall mission.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt oral argument, both respondent and the United States acknowledged that a pretext inquiry would sometimes be prohibited by principles of religious autonomy, and both conceded that a Roman Catholic priest who is dismissed for getting married could not sue the church and claim that his dismissal was actually based on a ground forbidden by the federal antidiscrimination laws. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 50.  But there is no principled basis for proscribing a pretext inquiry in such a case while permitting it in a case like the one now before us.  The Roman Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on clerical celibacy may be much better known than the Lutheran Church\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular familiarity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative factor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor believes that the religious function that respondent performed made it essential that she abide by the doctrine of internal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no position to second-guess that assessment.  This conclusion rests not on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ordination status or her formal title, but rather on her functional status as the type of employee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss in order to exercise the religious liberty that the \n \nFirst Amendment guarantees.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0It is unconventional to refer to many persons who clearly fall with-in the \xe2\x80\x9cministerial\xe2\x80\x9d exception, such as Protestant ministers, Catholic priests, and Jewish rabbis, as \xe2\x80\x9cemployees,\xe2\x80\x9d but I use the term in the sense in which it is used in the antidiscrimination laws that are often implicated in cases involving the exception.
