CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Court has considered this case and is of opinion that the jurisdiction cannot be supported.</p>\n<p>The words of the act of Congress are "where an alien is a party or the suit is between a citizen of a state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state."</p>\n<p>The Court understands these expressions to mean that each distinct interest should be represented by persons all of whom are entitled to sue or may be sued in the federal courts.  That is, that where the interest is joint, each of the persons concerned in that interest must be competent to sue or liable to be sued in those courts.</p>\n<p>But the Court does not mean to give an opinion in the case where several parties represent several distinct interests </p><p><a class="page-number" name="268">Page 7 U.
