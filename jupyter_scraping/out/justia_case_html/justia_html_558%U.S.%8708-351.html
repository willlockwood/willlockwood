Respondents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law, brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal Due Process Clause.  The District Court dismissed the case based on Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from that precedent and ruled for respondents.  This Court granted certiorari to review the  Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s due process determination, but at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property disputes between the parties had been resolved.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>1.\xc2\xa0The case is moot.  The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal questions only in the context of actual \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. III, \xc2\xa72, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of review, not just when the complaint is filed, <em>Preiser</em> v. <em>Newkirk</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/395/index.html">422 U. S. 395</a>, 401.  Here there is no longer any actual controversy regarding ownership or possession of the underlying property.  There is no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit within the category of cases that are \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cevading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The judgment below is vacated.  In moot cases, this Court normally vacates the lower court judgment, which clears the path for relitigation of the issues and preserves the rights of the parties, while prejudicing none by a preliminary decision.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/index.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 40.  Where mootness is the result of settlement rather than happenstance, however, the losing party forfeits the equitable remedy of vacatur.  U. S.<em> Bancorp Mortgage Co.</em> v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/18/index.html">513 U. S. 18</a>, 25.  This case more closely resembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.  In <em>Bancorp</em>, the party seeking review caused the mootness by voluntarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation.  Here, the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no significant role in the termination of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 state-court forfeiture proceedings.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 forfeiture cases took place with no procedural link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substantive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.  This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary practice and order vacatur.

See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa71; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Von Neumann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/242/index.html">474 U. S. 242</a> (1986); <em>United States</em> v. <em>$8,850, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/555/index.html">461 U. S. 555</a> (1983).  At the time of oral argument, however, we learned that the underlying property disputes have all ended.  The State has returned all the cars that it seized, and the individual property owners have either forfeited any relevant cash or have accepted as final the State\xe2\x80\x99s return of some of it.  We consequently find the case moot, and we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/index.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 941\xe2\x80\x93942 (9th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property (including cars and cash) used \xe2\x80\x9cto facilitate\xe2\x80\x9d a drug crime.  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \xc2\xa7570/505(a)(6) (West 2008).  It permits a police officer to seize that property without a warrant where (1) the officer has \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause to believe\xe2\x80\x9d the property was so used and (2) a \xe2\x80\x9cwarrantless seizure \xe2\x80\xa6 would be reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d in the circumstances.  \xc2\xa7570/505(b).  When an officer has seized property without a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency must notify the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney within 52 days of the seizure; the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney must notify the property owner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45 days; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings within yet a further 45 days.  See ch. 725, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7150/5\xe2\x80\x93150/6.  Thus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly five months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings\xe2\x80\x94during which time the statute permits the State to keep the car or cash within its possession.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents or \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d) brought this federal civil rights action against defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).  See Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Edmanuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in 2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars without a warrant.  See Complaint \xc2\xb625, App. 34a (Smith, seizure on Jan. 19, 2006); <em>id., </em>\xc2\xb626, at 34a (Perez, seizure on Mar. 8, 2006); <em>id., </em>\xc2\xb627, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on Apr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Motion for Class Certification \xc2\xb68, at 39a.  The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk Yunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006 police had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a warrant.  See Complaint \xc2\xb628, at 34a\xe2\x80\x9335a (Waldo, seizure on Jan. 20, 2006); <em>id., </em>\xc2\xb629, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on Sept. 26, 2006); <em>id., </em>\xc2\xb630, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July 2006); Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Motion for Class Certification \xc2\xb68, at 39a.  The plaintiffs added that the police department still had custody of their property.  See Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb624\xe2\x80\x9330, at 34a\xe2\x80\x9335a.  They claimed that the failure of the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal Due Process Clause.  See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa71.  And they asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class action, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a prompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare that the hearing must take place within 10 days of any seizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 current practice of keeping the property in custody for a longer time without a judicial determination of probable cause.  See Complaint \xc2\xb636, App. 36a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution does not require any procedure prior to the actual forfeiture proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Takaki</em>, 38 F.\xc2\xa03d 321, 324 (1994) (citing <em>Von Neumann</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 249).  On February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  It also denied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion for class certification.  The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal in the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 524 F.\xc2\xa03d 834.  It reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.  <em>Id.,</em> at 836\xe2\x80\x93839.  It held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedures set out in\xe2\x80\x9d the Illinois statute \xe2\x80\x9cshow insufficient concern for the due process right of the plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 838.  And it added that, \xe2\x80\x9cgiven the length of time which can result between the seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner to contest the seizure under\xe2\x80\x9d Illinois law, \xe2\x80\x9csome sort of mechanism to test the validity of the retention of the property is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case for further proceedings.  <em>Id.,</em> at 839.  Its mandate issued about seven weeks thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d determination.  The Court of Appeals then recalled its mandate.  The parties filed briefs in this Court.  We then recognized that\nthe case might be moot, and we asked the parties to address the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that there was no longer any dispute about ownership or possession of the relevant property.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney); <em>id., </em>at 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (plaintiffs).  The State had returned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.  See <em>id.,</em> at 5.  Two of the plaintiffs had \xe2\x80\x9cdefaulted,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently conceding that the State could keep the cash.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And the final plaintiff and the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney agreed that the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash at issue.  <em>Id.,</em> at 5, 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  As counsel for the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney told us, \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hose cases are over.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal questions only in the context of actual \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa72.  An \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Preiser</em> v. <em>Newkirk</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/395/index.html">422 U. S. 395</a>, 401 (1975) (quoting <em>Steffel</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html">415 U. S. 452</a>, 459, n.\xc2\xa010 (1974)).  In this case there is no longer any actual controversy between the parties about ownership or possession of the underlying property.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney argues that there is a continuing controversy over damages.  We concede that the plaintiffs filed a motion in the District Court seeking damages.  But the plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit issued its opinion.  And, after this Court granted certiorari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the case away from the District Court before the District Court could respond to the motion.  Thus, we have before us a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of a class.  And a class might well contain members who continue to dispute ownership of seized property.  But that fact is beside the point.  The District Court denied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 class certification motion.  The plaintiffs did not appeal that denial.  Hence the only disputes relevant here are those between these six plaintiffs and the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and those disputes are now over.  <em>United States Parole Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Geraghty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/388/index.html">445 U. S. 388</a>, 404 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cA named plaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press the appeal on the merits until a class has been properly certified\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawfulness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s hearing procedures.  But that dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 particular legal rights.  Rather, it is an abstract dispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs any more than it affects other Illinois citizens.  And a dispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the scope of the constitutional words \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Continental Bank Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/472/index.html">494 U. S. 472</a>, 477 (1990); <em>North Carolina</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/244/index.html">404 U. S. 244</a>, 246 (1971) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Aetna Life Ins.

S. 651</a>, 653 (1895).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can find no special circumstance here that might warrant our continuing to hear the case.  We have sometimes heard attacks on practices that no longer directly affect the attacking party, but are \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cevading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html">551 U. S. 449</a>, 462 (2007); <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co.</em> v. <em>ICC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/219/498/index.html">219 U. S. 498</a>, 515 (1911).  Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing suggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again prove subject to the State\xe2\x80\x99s seizure procedures.  See <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 109 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he capable-of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situations, and generally only where the named plaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>DeFunis</em> v. <em>Odegaard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/312/index.html">416 U. S. 312</a>, 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (1974) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  And in any event, since those who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices might bring damages actions, the practices do not \xe2\x80\x9cevade review.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div.</em> v. <em>Craft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/index.html">436 U. S. 1</a>, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1978) (damages claim saves case from mootness).  Consequently, the case is moot.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Preiser</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 403\xe2\x80\x93404; <em>Mills</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 658.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is less easy to say whether we should order the judgment below vacated.  The statute that enables us to vacate a lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is flexible, allowing a court to \xe2\x80\x9cdirect the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72106; see also <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.</em> v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/18/index.html">513 U. S. 18</a>, 21 (1994).  Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the lower court judgment in a moot case because doing so \xe2\x80\x9cclears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d preserving \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of all parties,\xe2\x80\x9d while prejudicing none \xe2\x80\x9cby a decision which \xe2\x80\xa6 was only preliminary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Munsingwear, </em>340 U. S., at 40.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>In <em>Bancorp, </em>however, we described circumstances where we would not do so.  We said that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here mootness results from settlement\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98happenstance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9closing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur.\xe2\x80\x9d  513 U. S., at 25.  The plaintiffs, pointing out that the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney agreed to return all three cars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at least four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within <em>Bancorp\xe2\x80\x99</em>s \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\xe2\x80\x9d exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, however, this case more closely resembles mootness through \xe2\x80\x9chappenstance\xe2\x80\x9d than through \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at least the kind of settlement that the Court considered in <em>Bancorp.</em> <em>Bancorp </em>focused upon a bankruptcy-related dispute that involved a legal question whether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied upon what the debtor said was a special exception (called the \xe2\x80\x9cnew value exception\xe2\x80\x9d) to ordinary creditor priority rules.  <em>Id.,</em> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  The parties contested that legal issue in the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s order to the Federal District Court; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of Appeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court.  <em>Id.,</em> at 20.  While the case was pending here, the parties settled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the court where the case originated)\xe2\x80\x94including their differences on this particular contested legal point.  <em>Ibid.</em>  They agreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would constitute a settlement that mooted the federal case.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bankruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settlement that mooted the case, this Court did <em>not </em>vacate the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reason for leaving the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in place was that mootness was <em>not </em>a result of \xe2\x80\x9cthe vagaries of circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 25.  Rather the party seeking review had \xe2\x80\x9c<em>caused </em>the mootness by voluntary action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24 (emphasis added).  By virtue of the settlement, that party had \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal or certiorari.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 25.  Hence, compared to mootness caused by \xe2\x80\x9chappenstance,\xe2\x80\x9d considerations of \xe2\x80\x9cequity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d tilted against vacatur.  <em>Id.,</em> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that the terminations here fall on the \xe2\x80\x9chappenstance\xe2\x80\x9d side of the line.  The six individual cases proceeded through a different court system without any procedural link to the federal case before us.  To our knowledge (and we have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in those cases raised the procedural question at issue here.  Rather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of state substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeitable or not?  And court docket sheets suggest that the six state cases terminated on substantive grounds in the ordinary course of such state proceedings.  In the three automobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the proceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40 months after the seizures, a long enough time for the State to have investigated the matters and to have determined (after the termination of any related criminal proceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to claim the cars.  See Dockets in <em>People</em> v. <em>2004 Chevrolet Impala</em>, No. 2006\xe2\x80\x93COFO\xe2\x80\x93000296 (Cook County, IL) (Brunston\xe2\x80\x99s car returned on July 27, 2009); <em>People</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, No. 2006\xe2\x80\x93COFO\xe2\x80\x93000036 (Cook County, IL) (Smith\xe2\x80\x99s car returned on May 5, 2008); and <em>People</em> v. <em>1999 Chevrolet Malibu</em>, No. 2006\xe2\x80\x93COFO\xe2\x80\x93000288 (Cook County, IL) (Perez\xe2\x80\x99s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007).  In the remaining contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily dismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long enough time for the State to have weighed the evidence and found a compromise settlement appropriate on the merits.  See Docket in <em>People</em> v. <em>$1,500 in U. S. Currency</em>, No. 2006\xe2\x80\x93COFO\xe2\x80\x93000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo\xe2\x80\x99s cash returned on Mar. 19, 2007).  The disparate dates at which plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 forfeiture proceedings terminated\xe2\x80\x9411, 14, 27, and 40 months after the seizures\xe2\x80\x94indicate that the State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 state-court cases, either with each other or with plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 federal civil rights case.  Cf. <em>Munsingwear</em>, 340 U. S., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (stating that a lower court judgment would have been vacated even though an action of the party seeking review had brought about the mootness <em>because</em> that action\xe2\x80\x94a commodity being decontrolled by Executive Order\xe2\x80\x94was basically unrelated); see also <em>Fleming</em> v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc.</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa02d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this federal case played no significant role in the termination of the separate state-court proceedings.  This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware of <em>Bancorp, </em>suggested the contrary at oral argument.  Indeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral argument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to avoid review in this case played no role at all in producing the state case terminations.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\xe2\x80\x9311, 33\xe2\x80\x9338.  And if the presence of this federal case played no role in causing the termination of those state cases, there is not present here the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary forfeit[ure]\xe2\x80\x9d of a legal remedy that led the Court in <em>Bancorp </em>to find that considerations of \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cequity\xe2\x80\x9d tilted against vacatur.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consequently conclude that we should follow our ordinary practice, thereby \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ing] the path for future relitigation of the issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Munsingwear</em>, 340 U. S., at 40.  Thus, nothing in this opinion prevents the plaintiffs from bringing a claim for damages based on the conduct alleged in their complaint.  <em>Id.</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9340.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963052">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF STEVENS, J.<br/>\nALVAREZ V.

Following the teaching of our decision in <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.</em> v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/18/index.html">513 U. S. 18</a> (1994), I would apply the general rule against vacating appellate judgments that have become moot because the parties settled.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bancorp</em> set forth the basic principles for determining whether to vacate a case that has become moot.  The overriding concern is equitable: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning we have disposed of moot cases in the manner \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cmost consonant to justice\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 in view of the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/239/466/index.html">239 U. S. 466</a>, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (1916), in turn quoting <em>South Spring Hill Gold Mining Co.</em> v. <em>Amador Medean Gold Mining Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/145/300/index.html">145 U. S. 300</a>, 302 (1892) (alteration in original)).  The \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d must be considered as part of this equitable inquiry, <em>Bancorp</em>, 513 U. S., at 26, 27, and that interest is generally better served by leaving appellate judgments intact.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Judicial precedents are presumptively correct and valuable to the legal community as a whole.  They are not merely the property of private litigants \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 26 (quoting <em>Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha</em> v. <em>U. S. Philips Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/27/index.html">510 U. S. 27</a>, 40 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting)).  Hence, we will typically vacate a judgment when the party seeking review has been \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrated by the vagaries of circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhen mootness results from unilateral action of the party who prevailed below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bancorp</em>, 513 U. S., at 25.  But we will typically decline to vacate when \xe2\x80\x9cthe party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 24, including action taken in good faith and in conjunction with the opposing party.  Even when \xe2\x80\x9crespondent agreed to [a] settlement that caused the mootness,\xe2\x80\x9d it remains \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burden, as the party seeking relief from the status quo of the appellate judgment, to demonstrate not merely equivalent responsibility for the mootness, but equitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 26.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]ootness by reason of settlement does not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the Court has misapplied these principles.  To be sure, the \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\xe2\x80\x9d between the parties in this case might be distinguished from the more conventional settlement reached by the parties in <em>Bancorp</em>.  And we have no evidence to suggest that petitioner returned respondents\xe2\x80\x99 property prior to the conclusion of our review with the purpose or expectation of manufacturing mootness.  Nevertheless, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to return the automobiles when it did appears to have been legally discretionary, as was the \xe2\x80\x9ccompromise settlement\xe2\x80\x9d that it reached with respondent Waldo regarding her cash, <em>ante</em>, at 8.  In light of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s purposive and voluntary action that caused the mootness\xe2\x80\x94along with its failure to alert us to the relevant facts or to explain why vacatur would serve the public interest\xe2\x80\x94I believe it has failed to carry its burden to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate \xe2\x80\xa6 equitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bancorp</em>, 513 U. S., at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was a third option for disposing of this case: We could have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  Like denying the petition in the first place, that disposition would have preserved the judgment below.  At the time we granted certiorari on February 23, 2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying property disputes for five of the six named respondents.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4, 8\xe2\x80\x939.  It was entirely predictable that the final settlement would soon follow.  Moreover, the briefing in this case has revealed a disagreement over basic descriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not passed upon below.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 60\xe2\x80\x9366 with Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9344.  And, of course, we have no way of knowing how the District Court would have applied the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 remand order, which left it great discretion to \xe2\x80\x9cfashion appropriate procedural relief\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwith the help of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>City of Chicago</em>, 524 F.\xc2\xa03d 834, 838 (CA7 2008).  It has become clear that the Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case; the improvidence of our grant provides an additional reason why we should not vacate the work product of our colleagues on the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and from its judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
