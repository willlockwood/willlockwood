WHITING et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93115.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 8, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 26, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for a person or other entity \xe2\x80\xa6 to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A).  Employers that violate that prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal sanctions.  IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat employment of unauthorized workers; the Act expressly preempts \xe2\x80\x9cany State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for employment.  In an attempt to improve that verification process in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Congress created E-Verify\xe2\x80\x94an internet-based system employers can use to check the work authorization status of employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this statutory background, several States have recently enacted laws attempting to impose sanctions for the employment of unauthorized aliens through, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arizona is one of them.  The Legal Arizona Workers Act provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, suspended or revoked.  That law also requires that all Arizona employers use E-Verify.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various business and civil rights organizations (collectively Chamber) filed this federal preenforcement suit against those charged with administering the Arizona law, arguing that the state law\xe2\x80\x99s license suspension and revocation provisions were both expressly and impliedly preempted by federal immigration law, and that the mandatory use of E-Verify was impliedly preempted.  The District Court found that the plain language of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause did not invalidate the Arizona law because the law did no more than impose licensing conditions on businesses operating within the State.  Nor was the state law preempted with respect to E-Verify, the court concluded, because although Congress had made the program voluntary at the national level, it had expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating participation.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">558 F.\xc2\xa03d 856, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II\xe2\x80\x93A, concluding that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s licensing law is not expressly preempted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s licensing law falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not expressly preempted.  While IRCA prohibits States from imposing \xe2\x80\x9ccivil or criminal sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it preserves state authority to impose sanctions \xe2\x80\x9cthrough licensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  That is what the Arizona law does\xe2\x80\x94it instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state employers that employ unauthorized aliens.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state statute also includes within its definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d documents such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact business in the State, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9), each of which has clear counterparts in APA and dictionary definitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9clicense.\xe2\x80\x9d  And even if a law regulating articles of incorporation and the like is not itself a \xe2\x80\x9clicensing law,\xe2\x80\x9d it is at the very least \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d to one, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause.  The Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Arizona law is not a \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d law because it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to grant them is without basis in law, fact, or logic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber contends that the savings clause should apply only to certain types of licenses or only to license revocation following an IRCA adjudication because Congress, when enacting IRCA, eliminated unauthorized worker prohibitions and associated adjudication procedures in another federal statute.  But no such limits are even remotely discernible in the statutory text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history to bolster its textual and structural arguments is unavailing given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law falls within the plain text of the savings clause.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal law.  At its broadest, the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that Congress intended the federal system to be exclusive.  But Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s procedures simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the States to pursue through licensing laws.  Given that Congress specifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise that authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And here Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law closely tracks IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions in all material respects.  For example, it adopts the federal definition of who qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized alien,\xe2\x80\x9d compare 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(3) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(11); provides that state investigators must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Government, making no independent determination of the matter, \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(B); and requires a state court to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider only the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s more general contention that the Arizona law is preempted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to strike in IRCA also fails.  The cases on which the Chamber relies in making this argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Buckman Co.</em> v. <em>Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Legal Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/341/index.html">531 U. S. 341</a>.  Regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not such an area.  And those cases all concern state actions that directly interfered with the operation of a federal program, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 351.  There is no similar interference here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber asserts that employers will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98business death penalty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9chiring unauthorized workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not the choice.  License termination is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized workers, but is triggered only by far more egregious violations.  And because the Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional violations, an employer acting in good faith need not fear the law\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions.  Moreover, federal and state antidiscrimination laws protect against employment discrimination and provide employers with a strong incentive not to discriminate.  Employers also enjoy safe harbors from liability when using E-Verify as required by the Arizona law.  The most rational path for employers is to obey both the law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibiting discrimination.  There is no reason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not to do so.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, concluding that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s E-Verify mandate is not impliedly preempted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that employers use E-Verify is not impliedly preempted.  The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no language circumscribing state action.  It does, however, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary of Homeland Security may not require any person or \xe2\x80\xa6  entity\xe2\x80\x9d outside the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cto participate in\xe2\x80\x9d E-Verify.  IIRIRA, \xc2\xa7402(a), (e).  The fact that the Federal Government may require the use of E-Verify in only limited circumstances says nothing about what the States may do.  The Government recently argued just that in another case and approvingly referenced Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law as an example of a permissible use of E-Verify when doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the federal scheme.  The state law requires no more than that an employer, after hiring an employee, \xe2\x80\x9cverify the employment eligibility of the employee\xe2\x80\x9d through E-Verify.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93214(A).  And the consequences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state and federal law\xe2\x80\x94an employer forfeits an otherwise available rebuttable presumption of compliance with the law.  Pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito, concluded in Part III\xe2\x80\x93B:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that employers use E-Verify in no way obstructs achieving the aims of the federal program.  In fact, the Government has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of E-Verify, and Congress has directed that E-Verify be made available in all 50 States.  And the Government has expressly rejected the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Arizona law, and those like it, will overload the federal system.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  A recently enacted Arizona statute\xe2\x80\x94the Legal Arizona Workers Act\xe2\x80\x94provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, sus-pended or revoked.  The law also requires that all\nArizona employers use a federal electronic verification system to confirm that the workers they employ are\nlegally authorized workers.  The question presented is whether federal immigration law preempts those provisions of Arizona law.  Because we conclude that the State\xe2\x80\x99s licensing provisions fall squarely within the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s savings clause and that the Arizona regulation does not otherwise conflict with federal law, we hold that the Arizona law is not preempted.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1952, Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq</em>.  That statute established a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive federal statutory scheme for regulation of immigration and naturalization\xe2\x80\x9d and set \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Canas</em> v. <em>Bica</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/351/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/351/index.html">424 U. S. 351</a>, 353, 359 (1976).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years following the enactment of the INA, several States took action to prohibit the employment of indi-viduals living within state borders who were not lawful residents of the United States.  For example, in 1971 Cali-fornia passed a law providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o employer shall knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  1971 Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, \xc2\xa71(a).  The California law imposed fines ranging from $200 to $500 for each violation of this prohibition.  \xc2\xa71(b).  At least 11 other States enacted provisions during that same time period proscribing the employment of unauthorized aliens.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first addressed the interaction of federal immigration law and state laws dealing with the employment of unauthorized aliens in <em>De Canas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/351/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/351/index.html">424 U. S. 351</a>.  In that case, we recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower to regulate immi-gration is unquestionably \xe2\x80\xa6 a federal power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 354.  At the same time, however, we noted that the \xe2\x80\x9cStates possess broad authority under their police powers to\nregulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 356, that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[ing] the knowing employment \xe2\x80\xa6 of persons not entitled to lawful residence in the United States, let alone to work here, is certainly within the mainstream of [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] police power,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and that the Federal Government had \xe2\x80\x9cat best\xe2\x80\x9d expressed \xe2\x80\x9ca peripheral concern with [the] employment of illegal entrants\xe2\x80\x9d at that point in time,  <em>id.,</em> at 360.  As a result, we declined to hold that a state law assessing civil fines for the employment of unauthorized aliens was preempted by federal immigration law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ten years after <em>De Canas</em>, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), 100 Stat. 3359.  IRCA makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for a person or other entity \xe2\x80\xa6 to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A).  IRCA defines an \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized alien\xe2\x80\x9d as an alien who is not \xe2\x80\x9clawfully admitted for permanent residence\xe2\x80\x9d or not otherwise authorized by the Attorney General to be employed in the United States.  \xc2\xa71324a(h)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To facilitate compliance with this prohibition, IRCA requires that employers review documents establishing\nan employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for employment.  \xc2\xa71324a(b).  An employer can confirm an employee\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to work by reviewing the employee\xe2\x80\x99s United States passport, resident alien card, alien registration card, or other document approved by the Attorney General; or by reviewing a combination of other documents such as a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and social security card.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D).  The employer must attest under penalty of perjury on Department of Homeland Security Form I\xe2\x80\x939 that he \xe2\x80\x9chas verified that the individual is not an unauthorized alien\xe2\x80\x9d by reviewing these documents.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(1)(A).  The form I\xe2\x80\x939 itself \xe2\x80\x9cand any information contained in or appended to [it] \xe2\x80\xa6 may not be used for purposes other than for enforcement of\xe2\x80\x9d IRCA and other specified provisions of federal law.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(5).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Employers that violate IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s strictures may be subjected to both civil and criminal sanctions.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an entity within the Department of Homeland Security, is authorized to bring charges against a noncompliant employer under \xc2\xa71324a(e).  Depending on the circumstances of the violation, a civil fine ranging from $250 to $16,000 per unauthorized worker may be imposed.  See \xc2\xa71324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136 (2008).  Employers that engage in a pattern or practice\nof violating IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements can be criminally prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned for up to six months.  \xc2\xa71324a(f)(1).  The Act also imposes fines for engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cunfair immigration-related employment practice[s]\xe2\x80\x9d such as discriminating on the basis of citizenship or national origin.  \xc2\xa71324b(a)(1); see \xc2\xa71324b(g)(2)(B).  Good-faith com-pliance with IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x939 document review requirements provides an employer with an affirmative defense if charged with a \xc2\xa71324a violation.  \xc2\xa71324a(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat employment of unauthorized workers.  The Act expressly preempts \xe2\x80\x9cany State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  Under that provision, state laws imposing civil fines for the employment of unauthorized workers like the one we upheld in <em>De Canas</em> are now expressly preempted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996, in an attempt to improve IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s employment verification system, Congress created three experimental complements to the I\xe2\x80\x939 process as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93655, note following 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a.  <em>Arizona Contractors Assn., Inc.</em> v.<em> Candelaria</em>, 534 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1036, 1042 (Ariz. 2008); see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(d).  Only one of those programs\xe2\x80\x94E-Verify\xe2\x80\x94remains in operation today.  Originally known as the \xe2\x80\x9cBasic Pilot Program,\xe2\x80\x9d E-Verify \xe2\x80\x9cis an internet-based system that allows an employer to verify an employee\xe2\x80\x99s work-authorization status.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc.</em> v. <em>Napolitano</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa03d 856, 862 (CA9 2009).  An employer submits a request to the E-Verify system based on information that the employee provides similar to that used in the I\xe2\x80\x939 process.  In response to that request,\nthe employer receives either a confirmation or a tentative nonconfirmation of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to work.  An employee may challenge a nonconfirmation report.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  The Arizona law, on its face, purports to impose sanctions through licensing laws.  The state law authorizes state courts to suspend or revoke an employer\xe2\x80\x99s business licenses if that employer knowingly or intentionally employs an unauthorized alien.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(A) and (F); \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212.01(A) and (F).  The Arizona law defines \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter or similar form of authorization that is required by law and that is issued by any agency for the purposes of operating a business in\xe2\x80\x9d the State.  \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9)(a).  That definition largely parrots the definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551(8) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98license\xe2\x80\x99 includes the whole or a part of an agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, membership, statutory exemption or other form of permission\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from that general definition, the Arizona law specifically includes within its definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d docu-ments such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact business in the State.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9).  These examples have clear counterparts in the APA definition just quoted.  See 5 U.

Articles of incorporation and certificates of partnership allow the formation of legal entities and permit them as such to engage in business and transactions \xe2\x80\x9cwhich but for such\xe2\x80\x9d authorization \xe2\x80\x9cwould be unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93302, 302(11) (West 2004) (articles of incorporation allow a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cto carry out its business and affairs\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onduct its business\xe2\x80\x9d); see also \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93202(A)(3) (West Supp. 2010).  As for state-issued authorizations for foreign businesses to operate within a State, we have re-peatedly referred to those as \xe2\x80\x9clicenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Heli-copteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.

Moreover, even if a law regulating articles of incorporation, partnership certificates, and the like is not itself a \xe2\x80\x9clicensing law,\xe2\x80\x9d it is at\nthe very least \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d to a licensing law, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber and the United States as <em>amicus</em> argue that the Arizona law is not a \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d law because it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to grant them.  Again, this construction of the term runs contrary to the definition that Congress itself has codified.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551(9) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98licensing\xe2\x80\x99 includes agency process respecting the grant, renewal, denial, <em>revocation</em>, <em>sus-pension</em>, <em>annulment</em>, <em>withdrawal</em>, limitation, amendment, modification, or conditioning of a license\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  It is also contrary to common sense.  There is no basis in law, fact, or logic for deeming a law that grants licenses a licensing law, but a law that suspends or revokes those very licenses something else altogether.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber also submits that the manner in which Congress amended a related statute when enacting IRCA supports a narrow interpretation of the savings clause.  The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71801 <em>et seq</em>., requires employers to secure a registration certificate from the Department\nof Labor before engaging in any \xe2\x80\x9cfarm labor contracting activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71811(a).  Prior to IRCA, AWPA had contained its own prohibition on hiring unauthorized workers, with accompanying adjudication procedures.  See \xc2\xa71813(a); \xc2\xa71816(a) (1982 ed.) (repealed by IRCA, 100 Stat. 3372); \xc2\xa71851(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) (1982 ed.) (amended by IRCA, 100 Stat. 3372).  When Congress enacted IRCA, it repealed AWPA\xe2\x80\x99s separate unauthorized worker prohibition and eliminated the associated adjudication process.  Under the current state of the law, an AWPA certification may be denied based on a prior IRCA violation.  \xc2\xa71813(a)(6) (2006 ed.).  And once obtained, that certification can be revoked because of the employment of an unauthorized alien only following a finding of an IRCA violation.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber asserts that IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s amendment of AWPA shows that Congress meant to allow state licensing sanctions only after a federal IRCA adjudication, just as adverse action under AWPA can now be taken only through IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures.  But the text of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s savings clause says nothing about state licensing sanctions being contingent on prior federal adjudication, or indeed about state licensing processes at all.  The simple fact that federal law creates procedures for federal investigations and adjudications culminating in federal civil or criminal sanctions does not indicate that Congress intended to prevent States from establishing their own procedures for imposing\ntheir own sanctions through licensing.  Were AWPA not amended to conform with IRCA, two different federal agencies would be responsible for administering two different unauthorized alien employment laws.  The conforming amendments eliminated that potential redundancy and centralized federal adjudicatory authority.  That hardly supports a conclusion that any state licensing programs must also be contingent on the central federal system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In much the same vein, the Chamber argues that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cAWPA\xe2\x80\x99s separate prohibition concerning unauthorized workers belies any suggestion that IRCA meant to authorize each of the 50 States \xe2\x80\xa6 to impose\nits own separate prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Congress instead wanted uniformity in immigration law enforcement.  Brief for Petitioners 36.  Justice Breyer also objects to the departure from \xe2\x80\x9cone centralized enforcement scheme\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law.  <em>Post</em>, at 7 (dissenting opinion).<em> </em>But Congress expressly preserved the ability of the States to impose their own sanctions through licensing; that\xe2\x80\x94like our federal system in general\xe2\x80\x94necessarily entails the prospect of some departure from homogeneity.  And as for \xe2\x80\x9cseparate prohibition[s],\xe2\x80\x9d it is worth recalling that the Arizona licensing law is based exclusively on the federal prohibition\xe2\x80\x94a court reviewing a complaint under the Arizona law may \xe2\x80\x9cconsider only the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an employee is an unauthorized alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even more boldly, the Chamber contends that IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s savings clause was intended to allow States to impose licensing sanctions solely on AWPA-related farm contracting licensees.  AWPA specifically recognized that federal regulation of farm contracting licensing was only \xe2\x80\x9cintended to supplement State law,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71871, and the Chamber argues that the purpose of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s savings clause was limited to preserving existing state farm contractor licensing programs.  But here again no such limit is remotely discernible in the statutory text.  Absent any textual basis, we are not inclined to limit so markedly\nthe otherwise broad phrasing of the savings clause.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/77/index.html">287 U. S. 77</a>, 83 (1932) (\xe2\x80\x9cextrinsic aids to construction\xe2\x80\x9d may be used \xe2\x80\x9cto solve, but not to create, an ambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber argues that its textual and structural arguments are bolstered by IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  We have already concluded that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law falls within the plain text of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s savings clause.  And, as we have said before, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/546/index.html">545 U. S. 546</a>, 568 (2005); see also <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/137/index.html">535 U. S. 137</a>, 149\xe2\x80\x93150, n. 4 (2002).  Whatever the usefulness of relying on legislative history materials in general, the arguments against doing so are particularly compelling here.  Beyond verbatim recitation of the statutory text, all of the legislative history documents related to IRCA save one fail to discuss the savings clause at all.  The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the Senate version of\nthe law does not comment on it.  See S. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93132 (1985).  Only one of the four House Reports on the law touches on the licensing exception, see H. R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93682, pt.\xc2\xa01, p.\xc2\xa058 (1986), and we have previously dismissed that very report as \xe2\x80\x9ca rather slender reed\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cone House of a politically divided Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 149\xe2\x80\x93150, n.\xc2\xa04.  And the Conference Committee Report does not discuss the scope of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision in any way.  See H. Conf. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x931000 (1986).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IRCA expressly preempts some state powers dealing with the employment of unauthorized aliens and it expressly preserves others.

At its broadest level, the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended the federal system to be exclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d and that any state system therefore necessarily conflicts with federal law.  Brief for Petitioners 39.  But Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s procedures simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed Arizona to pursue through licensing laws.  Given that Congress specifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise that authority.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>And here Arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that its law closely tracks IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions in all material respects.

According to the Chamber, the harshness of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exert[s] an extraneous pull on the scheme established by Congress\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that impermissibly upsets that balance.

Regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws has never been considered such an area of dominant federal concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, those cases all concern state actions that directly interfered with the operation of the federal program.  In <em>Buckman</em>, for example, the Court determined that allowing a state tort action would cause applicants before a federal agency \xe2\x80\x9cto submit a deluge of information that the [agency] neither wants nor needs, resulting in additional burdens on the [agency\xe2\x80\x99s] evaluation of an application,\xe2\x80\x9d and harmful delays in the agency process.  531 U. S., at 351.  In <em>Garamendi</em>, a state law imposing sanctions on insurance companies directly \xe2\x80\x9cthwart[ed] the [Federal] Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy of repose\xe2\x80\x9d for insurance companies that participated in an international program negotiated by the President.  539 U.

S., at 377.  The state law in <em>Bonito Boats</em> extended patent-like protection \xe2\x80\x9cfor subject matter for which patent protection has been denied or has expired,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthus eroding the general rule of free competition upon which the attractiveness of the federal patent bargain depends.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 159, 161.  And the portions of <em>Locke</em> on which the Chamber relies involved state efforts \xe2\x80\x9cto impose additional unique substantive regulation on the at-sea conduct of vessels\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can area where the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of our Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S., at 106, 99.  There is no similar interference with the federal program in this case; that program operates unimpeded by the state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0License suspension and revocation are significant sanctions.  But they are typical attributes of a licensing regime.  Numerous Arizona laws provide for the suspension or revocation of licenses for failing to comply with specified state laws.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x93108.05(D), 32\xe2\x80\x93852.01(L), 32\xe2\x80\x931154(B), 32\xe2\x80\x931451(M), 41\xe2\x80\x932186 (West 2002).  Federal law recognizes that the authority to license includes the authority to suspend, revoke, annul, or withdraw a license.  See 5 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7551(9).  Indeed, AWPA itself\xe2\x80\x94on which the Chamber so heavily relies\xe2\x80\x94provides that AWPA \xe2\x80\x9ccertificates of registration\xe2\x80\x9d can be suspended or revoked for employing an unauthorized alien.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71813(a)(6).  It makes little sense to preserve state authority to impose sanctions through licensing, but not allow States to revoke licenses when appropriate as one of those sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber and Justice Breyer assert that employers will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98business death penalty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9chiring unauthorized workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (dissenting opinion); see Brief for Petitioners 3, 35.  That is not the choice.  License termination is not an available sanction simply for \xe2\x80\x9chiring unauthorized workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Only far more egregious violations of the law trigger that consequence.  The Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional violations.  The law\xe2\x80\x99s permanent licensing sanctions do not come into play until a second knowing or intentional violation at the same business location, and only if the second violation occurs while the employer is still on probation for the first.  These limits ensure that licensing sanctions are imposed only when an employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fully justifies them.  An\nemployer acting in good faith need have no fear of the sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Chamber points out, IRCA has its own anti-discrimination provisions, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324b(a)(1), (g)(1)(B) (imposing sanctions for discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cagainst any individual \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to the hiring \xe2\x80\xa6 or the discharging of the individual from employment\xe2\x80\x9d); Arizona law certainly does nothing to displace those.  Other federal laws, and Arizona anti-discrimination laws, provide further protection against employment discrimination\xe2\x80\x94and strong incentive for employers not to discriminate.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) (prohibiting discrimination based on \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa741\xe2\x80\x931463(B)(1) (West Supp. 2010) (prohibiting employment discrimination based on \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All that is required to avoid sanctions under the Legal Arizona Workers Act is to refrain from knowingly or intentionally violating the employment law.  Employers enjoy safe harbors from liability when they use the I\xe2\x80\x939 system and E-Verify\xe2\x80\x94as Arizona law requires them to do.  The most rational path for employers is to obey the law\xe2\x80\x94both the law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibiting discrimination\xe2\x80\x94and there is no reason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with any piece of legislation, Congress did indeed seek to strike a balance among a variety of interests when it enacted IRCA.  Part of that balance, however, involved allocating authority between the Federal Government and the States.  The principle that Congress adopted in doing so was not that the Federal Government can impose large sanctions, and the States only small ones.  IRCA instead preserved state authority over a particular category of sanctions\xe2\x80\x94those imposed \xe2\x80\x9cthrough licensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course Arizona hopes that its law will result in more effective enforcement of the prohibition on employing unauthorized aliens.  But in preserving to the States the authority to impose sanctions through licensing laws, Congress did not intend to preserve only those state laws that would have no effect.  The balancing process that culminated in IRCA resulted in a ban on hiring unauthorized aliens, and the state law here simply seeks to enforce that ban.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Implied preemption analysis does not justify a \xe2\x80\x9cfreewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives\xe2\x80\x9d; such an endeavor \xe2\x80\x9cwould undercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the courts that preempts state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gade</em> v. <em>National Solid Wastes Management Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/88/index.html">505 U.

That threshold is not met here.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber also argues that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that employers use the federal E-Verify system to determine whether an employee is authorized to work is im-pliedly preempted.  In the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress wanted to develop a reliable and non-burdensome system of work-authorization verification\xe2\x80\x9d that could serve as an alternative to the I\xe2\x80\x939 procedures, and the \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory use of E-Verify impedes that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 866.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin again with the relevant text.  The provision of IIRIRA setting up the program that includes E-Verify contains no language circumscribing state action.  It does, however, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary of Homeland Security may not require any person or other entity [outside of the Federal Government] to participate in a pilot program\xe2\x80\x9d such as E-Verify.  IIRIRA \xc2\xa7402(a), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93656.  That provision limits what the Secretary of Homeland Security may do\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Government recently argued just that, and approvingly referenced Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s E-Verify law when doing so.  In 2008, an Executive Order mandated that executive agencies require federal contractors to use E-Verify as a condition of receiving a federal contract.  See Exec. Order No. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008).  When that Order and its implementing regulation were challenged, the Government pointed to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s E-Verify mandate as an example of a permissible use of that system:  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he State of Arizona has required all public and private employers in that State to use E-Verify \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  <em>This is permissible</em> because the State of Arizona is not the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Reply Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment in No.\xc2\xa08:08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9303444 (D Md.), p.\xc2\xa07 (emphasis added), appeal dism\xe2\x80\x99d, No. 09\xe2\x80\x932006 (CA4, Dec. 14, 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the federal scheme.  The Arizona law requires that \xe2\x80\x9cevery employer, after hiring an employee, shall verify the employment eligibility of the employee\xe2\x80\x9d through E-Verify.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93214(A) (West Supp. 2010).  That requirement is entirely consistent with the federal law.  And the consequences of not using E-Verify under the Arizona law are the same as the consequences of not using the system under federal law.  In both instances, the only result is that the employer forfeits the otherwise available rebuttable presumption that it complied with the law.  Compare IIRIRA \xc2\xa7402(b)(1) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(I).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objective in authorizing the development of E-Verify was to ensure reliability in employment author-ization verification, combat counterfeiting of identity documents, and protect employee privacy.  8 U.

The Department of Homeland Security has even used \xe2\x80\x9cbillboard and radio advertisements \xe2\x80\xa6 to encour-\nage greater participation\xe2\x80\x9d in the E-Verify program.  534 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1056.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chamber contends that \xe2\x80\x9cif the 49 other States followed Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s lead, the state-mandated drain on federal resources would overwhelm the federal system and render it completely ineffective, thereby defeating Congress\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective in establishing E-Verify.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 50\xe2\x80\x9351.

In exercising that authority, Arizona has taken the route least likely to cause tension with federal law.  It uses the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s own definition of \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized alien,\xe2\x80\x9d it relies solely on the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s own determination of who is an unauthorized alien, and it requires Arizona employers to use the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s own system for checking employee status.

Luckily, we need not address such fanciful hypotheticals; Arizona limits its definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d to those state per-missions issued \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purposes of operating a business\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nState.  Ariz. Rev. Stat.

See \xc2\xa742\xe2\x80\x935005(A) (West 2006) (Corporations that receive \xe2\x80\x9cgross proceeds of sales or gross income upon which a privilege tax is imposed \xe2\x80\xa6 shall make application to the department for a privilege license.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a corporation \xe2\x80\x9cshall not engage or continue in business until the [corporation] has obtained a privilege license.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Suspending or revoking an employer\xe2\x80\x99s articles of incorporation will often be entirely redundant.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa742\xe2\x80\x935010, 5061\xe2\x80\x935076 (West 2006 and West Supp. 2010) (describing when transaction privilege tax licenses are required).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer poses several rhetorical questions challenging our reading of IRCA and then goes on to propose two seemingly alternative views of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that it was meant to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cemployment-related licensing systems,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis deleted),<em> </em>or, even more narrowly, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe licensing of firms in the business of recruiting or referring workers for employment, such as \xe2\x80\xa6 state agricultural labor contractor licensing schemes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 13.  If we are asking questions, a more telling one may be why, if Congress had intended such limited exceptions to its prohibition on state sanctions, it did not simply say so, instead of excepting \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d generally?</p>\n<p>\n\nJustice Sotomayor takes a different tack.  Invoking arguments that resemble those found in our implied preemption cases, she concludes that the Arizona law \xe2\x80\x9cfalls outside\xe2\x80\x9d the savings clause and is expressly preempted because it allows \xe2\x80\x9cstate courts to determine whether a person has employed an unauthorized alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 2 (dissenting opinion).  While Justice Breyer would add language to the statute narrowly limiting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d to specific types of licenses, Justice Sotomayor creates an entirely new statutory requirement: She would allow States to impose sanctions through \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d only after a federal adjudication.  Such a requirement is found nowhere in the text, and Justice Sotomayor does not even attempt to link it to a specific textual provision.</p>\n<p>\n\nIt should not be surprising that the two dissents have sharply different views on how to read the statute.  That is the sort of thing that can happen when statutory analysis is so untethered from the text.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p>\n\n\xc2\xa0After specifying that a state court may consider \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d the federal determination, the Arizona law goes on to provide that the federal determination is \xe2\x80\x9ca rebuttable presumption of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s lawful status,\xe2\x80\x9d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H) (West Supp. 2010).  Arizona explains that this provision does not permit the State to establish unlawful status apart from the federal determination\xe2\x80\x94the provision could hardly do that, given the foregoing.  It instead operates to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that the <em>employer</em> has an opportunity to rebut the evidence presented to establish a worker\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 49 (emphasis added).  Only in that sense is the federal determination a \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46\xe2\x80\x9347.

The Chamber does not suggest that this prohibition is any more problematic than the prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d employing an unauthorized alien.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Chamber contends that the Arizona law conflicts with federal law because IRCA prohibits the use of the I\xe2\x80\x939 form and \xe2\x80\x9cany information contained in or appended to [it]\xe2\x80\x9d from being \xe2\x80\x9cused for purposes other than for enforcement of\xe2\x80\x9d IRCA and other specified federal laws.  8 U.

That argument mistakenly assumes that an employer would need to use the I\xe2\x80\x939 form or its supporting documents themselves to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense in Arizona court.

See <em>post</em>, at 8, 19.  Statistics from Fiscal Year 2010, however, indicate that of the 15,640,167 E-Verify cases submitted, 98.3% were automatically confirmed as work authorized, 0.3% were confirmed as work authorized after contesting and resolving an initial nonconfir-mation\xe2\x80\x94an avenue available to all workers\xe2\x80\x94and 1.43% were not\nfound work authorized.

As Justice Breyer notes, the initial mismatches (the 0.3%) are frequently due to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98incorrectly spelled [names] in government databases or on identification documents.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 19.  Such a hazard is of course not unique to E-Verify.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  The state law before us, the Legal Arizona Workers Act, imposes civil sanctions upon those who employ unauthorized aliens.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211 <em>et seq.</em> (West Supp. 2010).  Thus the state law falls within the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s general pre-emption rule and is pre-empted\xe2\x80\x94unless it also falls within that rule\xe2\x80\x99s exception for \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike the Court, I do not believe the state law falls within this exception, and I consequently would hold it pre-empted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona calls its state statute a \xe2\x80\x9clicensing law,\xe2\x80\x9d and the statute uses the word \xe2\x80\x9clicensing.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the statute strays beyond the bounds of the federal licensing exception, for\nit defines \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d to include articles of incorporation and partnership certificates, indeed <em>virtually every </em>state-law authorization for<em> any </em>firm, corporation, or partnership to do business in the State.  \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9)(a); cf. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9)(c) (excepting professional licenses, and water and environmental permits).  Congress did not intend its \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d language to create so broad an exemption, for doing so would permit States to eviscerate the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision, indeed to subvert the Act itself, by undermining Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts (1) to protect lawful workers from national-origin-based discrimination and (2) to protect lawful employers against erroneous prosecution or punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dictionary definitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d are, as the majority points out, broad enough to include virtually any permission that the State chooses to call a \xe2\x80\x9clicense.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 10 (relying on a dictionary and the federal Administrative Procedure Act).  But neither dictionary definitions nor the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d in an unrelated statute can demonstrate what scope Congress intended the word \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d to have <em>as it used that word in this federal statute</em>.  Instead, statutory context must ultimately determine the word\xe2\x80\x99s coverage<em>.</em>  Context tells a driver that he cannot produce a partnership certificate when a policeman stops the car and asks for a license.  Context tells all of us that \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Act does not include marriage licenses or the licensing of domestic animals.  And context, which includes statutory purposes, language, and history, tells us that the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d language does not embrace Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s overly broad definition of that term.  That is to say, ordinary corporate charters, certificates of partnership, and the like do not fall within the scope of the word \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d as used in this federal exception.  See <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U.

Ordinarily, an express pre-emption provision\nin a federal statute indicates a particular congressional interest in <em>preventing </em>States from enacting laws that might interfere with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statutory objectives.  See <em>International Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Ouellette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/481/index.html">479 U. S. 481</a>, 494 (1987).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d exception, however, does the opposite.  It <em>facilitates </em>the creation of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obstacle[s] to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crosby</em> v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/363/index.html">530 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324b(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the Act sets forth a carefully calibrated sanction system.  The penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens are graduated to prevent the Act from unduly burdening employers who are not serious offenders.  As adjusted for inflation, civil penalties for a first violation of the employment restrictions range from $375\xe2\x80\x93$3,200 per worker,\nand rise to $3,200\xe2\x80\x93$16,000 per worker for repeat offenders.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133 (2008); see also \xc2\xa71324a(f) (imposing criminal fines of not more than $3,000 per worker and imprisonment for up to six months for \xe2\x80\x9cpattern or practice\xe2\x80\x9d violators of employment restrictions).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As importantly, the Act limits or removes any incentive to discriminate on the basis of national origin by setting antidiscrimination fines at equivalent levels: $375\xe2\x80\x93$3,200 per worker for first-time offenders, and $3,200\xe2\x80\x93$16,000 per worker for repeat offenders.  \xc2\xa71324b(g)(2)(B)(iv); 73 Fed. Reg. 10134.  The Act then ties its unlawful employment and antidiscrimination provisions together by providing that, should the antihiring provisions terminate, the antidiscrimination provisions will also terminate, \xc2\xa71324b(k), \xe2\x80\x9cthe justification for them having been removed,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x931000, p.\xc2\xa087 (1986).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, compare and contrast Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute.  As I have said, that statute applies to virtually all business-related licenses, other than professional licenses.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93211(9).  Like the federal Act, the state law forbids the employment of unauthorized aliens.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(A), 23\xe2\x80\x93212.01(A).  It also provides employers with somewhat similar defenses.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(I)\xe2\x80\x93(J), 23\xe2\x80\x93212.01(I)\xe2\x80\x93(J).  But thereafter the state and federal laws part company.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the state statute seriously threatens the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscriminatory objectives by radically skewing the relevant penalties.  For example, in the absence of the Arizona statute, an Arizona employer who intentionally hires an unauthorized alien for the second time would risk a maximum penalty of $6,500.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(e)(4)\n(A)(ii); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133.  But the Arizona statute subjects that same employer (in respect to the same two incidents) to mandatory, permanent loss of the right to do business in Arizona\xe2\x80\x93a penalty that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Governor has called the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212.01(F)(2); News Release, Governor Signs Employer Sanctions Bill (2007), App. 399.  At the same time, the state law leaves the other side of the punishment balance\xe2\x80\x94the antidiscrimination side\xe2\x80\x94unchanged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is no idle concern.  Despite the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prevent discriminatory practices, there is evidence that four years after<em> </em>it had become law, discrimination was a serious problem.  In 1990, the General Accounting Office identified \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6 as a result of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  Report to the Congress, Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and the Question of Discrimination 3, 37, 80.  Sixteen percent of employers in Los Angeles admitted that they applied the I\xe2\x80\x939 requirement \xe2\x80\x9conly to foreign-looking or foreign-sounding persons,\xe2\x80\x9d and 22 percent of Texas employers reported that they \xe2\x80\x9cbegan a practice to (1) hire only persons born in the United States or (2) not hire persons with temporary work eligibility documents\xe2\x80\x9d because of the Act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9343.  If even the federal Act (with its carefully balanced penalties) can result in some employers discriminating, how will employers behave when erring on the side of discrimination leads only to relatively small fines, while erring on the side of hiring unauthorized workers leads to the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law subjects lawful employers to in-creased burdens and risks of erroneous prosecution.  In addition to the Arizona law\xe2\x80\x99s severely burdensome sanctions, the law\xe2\x80\x99s procedures create enforcement risks not present in the federal system.  The federal Act creates one centralized enforcement scheme, run by officials versed in immigration law and with access to the relevant federal documents.  The upshot is an increased likelihood that federal officials (or the employer) will discover whether adverse information flows from an error-prone source and that they will proceed accordingly, thereby diminishing the likelihood that burdensome proceedings and liability reflect documentary mistakes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrast the enforcement system that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute creates.  Any citizen of the State can complain (anonymously or otherwise) to the state attorney general (or any county attorney), who then \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> investigate,\xe2\x80\x9d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(B) (emphasis added), and, upon a determination that that the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint is not false and frivolous \xe2\x80\xa6 shall notify the appropriate county attorney to bring an action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(C)(3).  This mandatory language, the lower standard (\xe2\x80\x9cnot frivolous\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \n\xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d), and the removal of immigration officials from the state screening process (substituting numerous, elected county attorneys) increase the likelihood that suspicious circumstances will lead to prosecutions and liability of employers\xe2\x80\x94even where more careful investigation would have revealed that there was no violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, this matter is far from trivial.  Studies of one important source of Government information\xe2\x80\x94the E-Verify system\xe2\x80\x94describe how the federal administrative process <em>corrected </em>that system\xe2\x80\x99s tentative \xe2\x80\x9cunemployable\xe2\x80\x9d indications <em>18% of the time</em>.  This substantial error rate is not a function of a small sample size.  See <em>ante</em>, at 26, n. 12.  Rather, data from one fiscal year showed 46,921 workers initially rejected but later \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed as work authorized\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all while E-Verify was used by only a fraction of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s employers. U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Statistics and Reports, http://\nwww.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9a\nc89243c6a7543f6d1a\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0?vgnextchannel\xc2\xa0=7c579589cdb76210V\ngnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD (Feb. 4, 2011) (as visited May 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  That is to say nearly one-in-five times that the E-Verify system suggested that an individual was not lawfully employable (<em>i.e.</em>, returned a tentative nonconfirmation of work authorization), the system was wrong; and subsequent review in the federal administrative process determined as much.  (And those wrongly identified were likely to be persons of foreign, rather than domestic, origin, by a ratio of approximately 20 to 1.)  See Westat, Findings of the E-Verify Program Evaluation xxxi, 210, 246 (Dec. 2009) (assessing data from April to June 2008).  E-Verify\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy rate is even worse \xe2\x80\x9cin states that require the use of E-Verify for all or some of their employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 122.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A related provision of the state law aggravates the risk of erroneous prosecutions.  The state statute says that\nin \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider only the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination pursuant to 8 [U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa71373(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H).  But the federal provision to which the state law refers, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71373(c), says only that the Federal Government, upon a State\xe2\x80\x99s request, shall verify a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccitizenship or immigration status.\xe2\x80\x9d  It says nothing about work authorization.  See <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  It says nothing about the source of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s information.  It imposes no duty upon the Federal Government or anyone else to investigate the validity of that information, which may falsely implicate an employer 18% of the time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So what is the employer to do?  What statute gives an employer whom the State proceeds against in state court the right to conduct discovery against the Federal Government?  The Arizona statute, like the federal statute, says that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s use of an I\xe2\x80\x939 form provides a defense.  But there is a hitch.  The federal Act says that neither the I\xe2\x80\x939 form, nor \xe2\x80\x9cany information contained\nin or appended to\xe2\x80\x9d the form, \xe2\x80\x9cmay \xe2\x80\xa6 be used for pur-poses other than for enforcement of this\xe2\x80\x9d federal Act.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(5).  So how can the employer present a defense, say, that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s information base is flawed?  The majority takes the view that the forms are not <em>necessary</em> to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa09.  But the I\xe2\x80\x939 form would surely be the employer\xe2\x80\x99s most effective evidence.  See also <em>post</em>, at 11 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the unavailability of I\xe2\x80\x939 forms to defend against state-court charges means that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended no such\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the Arizona statute facilitate the presentation of a defense when it immediately follows (1) its statement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall consider <em>only</em> the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination\xe2\x80\x9d when it considers \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an employee is an <em>unauthorized alien\xe2\x80\x9d </em>with (2) its statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>lawful</em> status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H) (emphasis added).  The two statements sound as if they mean that a Federal Government determination that the worker is <em>unlawful\n</em>is conclusive against the employer, but its determination that the worker\xe2\x80\x99s employment is <em>lawful </em>is subject to rebuttal by the State.  Arizona tells us that the statute means the opposite.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16, n. 7.  But the legal briefs of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general do not bind the state courts.  And until the matter is cleared up, employers, despite I\xe2\x80\x939 checks, despite efforts to use E-Verify, will hesitate to hire those they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that is my basic point.  Either directly or through the uncertainty that it creates, the Arizona statute will impose additional burdens upon lawful employers and consequently lead those employers to erect ever stronger safeguards against the hiring of unauthorized aliens\xe2\x80\x94without counterbalancing protection against unlawful discrimination.  And by defining \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d so broadly, by bringing nearly all businesses within its scope, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute creates these effects statewide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why would Congress, after deliberately limiting ordinary penalties to the range of a few thousand dollars per illegal worker, want to permit far more drastic state penalties that would directly and mandatorily destroy entire businesses?  Why would Congress, after carefully balancing sanctions to avoid encouraging discrimination, want to allow States to destroy that balance?  Why would Congress, after creating detailed procedural protections for employers, want to allow States to undermine them?  Why would Congress want to write into an express pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x94a provision designed to prevent States from undercutting federal statutory objectives\xe2\x80\x94an exception that could so easily destabilize its efforts?  The answer to these questions is that Congress would not have wanted to do any of these things.  And that fact indicates that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the licensing exception\xe2\x80\x94a reading that would allow what Congress sought to forbid\xe2\x80\x94is wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal licensing exception cannot apply to a state statute that, like Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute, seeks to bring virtually all articles of incorporation and partnership certificates within its scope.  I would find the scope of the exception\nto federal pre-emption to be far more limited.  Context, purpose, and history make clear that the \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d at issue involve <em>employment-related </em>licensing systems.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issuance of articles of incorporation and partnership certificates and the like have long had little or nothing to do with hiring or \xe2\x80\x9cemployment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, Arizona provides no evidence that any State, at the time the federal Act was enacted, had refused to grant or had revoked, say, partnership certificates, in light of the partners\xe2\x80\x99 hiring practices of any kind, much less the hiring of unauthorized aliens.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa729\xe2\x80\x93308 (limited partnership formed upon the filing of a certificate of partnership providing names and addresses); \xc2\xa729\xe2\x80\x93345 (providing for dissolution of a limited partnership \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n application by or for a partner or assignee \xe2\x80\xa6 whenever it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the partnership agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To read the exception as covering laws governing corporate charters and partnership certificates (which are not usually called \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d laws) is to permit States to turn virtually every permission-related state law into an employment-related \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d law.  The State need only call the permission a \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d and revoke the license should its holder hire an unauthorized alien.  If what was not previously an employment-related licensing law can become one simply by using it as a sanction for hiring unauthorized aliens or simply by state definition, indeed, if the State can call a corporate charter an employment-related licensing law, then why not an auto licensing law (amended to revoke the driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses of those who hire unauthorized aliens)?  Why not a dog licensing law?  Or why not \xe2\x80\x9cimpute\xe2\x80\x9d a newly required license to conduct any business to every human being in the State, withdrawing that license should that individual hire an unauthorized alien?  See S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa741\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x9320 (Supp. 2010) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll private employers in South Carolina \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be imputed a South Carolina employment license, which permits a private employer to employ a person in this State,\xe2\x80\x9d but conditioning the license on the company\xe2\x80\x99s not hiring unauthorized aliens).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such laws might prove more effective in stopping the hiring of unauthorized aliens.  But they are unlikely to do so consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 other critically important goals, in particular, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to protect from discrimination legal workers who look or sound foreign.  That is why we should read the federal exemption\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d laws as limited to those that involve the kind of licensing that, in the absence of this general state statute, would nonetheless have some significant relation to employment or hiring practices.  Otherwise we read the federal \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d exception as authorizing a State to undermine, if not to swallow up, the federal pre-emption rule.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore read the words \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws\xe2\x80\x9d as covering state licensing systems applicable primarily to the licensing of firms in the business of recruiting or referring workers for employment, such as the state agricultural labor contractor licensing schemes in existence when the federal Act was created.  This reading is consistent with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s history and language, and it minimizes the risk of harm of the kind just described.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s history supports this interpretation.  Ever since 1964, the Federal Government has administered statutes that create a federal licensing scheme for agricultural labor contractors, firms that specialize in recruiting agricultural workers and referring them to farmers for a fee.  Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963 (FLCRA), 78 Stat. 920; Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583.  The statutes require agricultural labor contractors to register with the federal Secretary of Labor, to obtain a registration certificate (in effect a license), and to require the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s employees to carry that certificate with them when engaging in agricultural labor contracting activities.  AWPA \xc2\xa7101; FLCRA \xc2\xa74.  The statutes list a host of forbidden activities, one of which (prior to 1986) was hiring unauthorized aliens.  See AWPA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7103, 106; FLCRA \xc2\xa75(b).  Prior to 1986, if the federal Labor Department believed\na firm had violated these substantive provisions, it could institute administrative proceedings within the Labor Department.  And if the Secretary found the labor contracting firm had violated the provisions, the Secretary could impose monetary penalties or withdraw the firm\xe2\x80\x99s registration.  AWPA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7103, 503; FLCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75(b), 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most important, and unlike the 1986 Act before us, the earlier agricultural labor contracting statutes <em>did not pre-empt similar state laws</em>.  To the contrary, the earlier Acts were \xe2\x80\x9cintended to supplement State law\xe2\x80\x9d and did not \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse any person from compliance with appropriate State law and regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  AWPA \xc2\xa7521; see FLCRA \xc2\xa712.  By 1986, nearly a dozen States had developed state licensing systems for agricultural labor contractors, <em>i.e.</em>, firms that recruited and referred farm (and sometimes forestry) workers for a fee; some of these laws provided that state licenses could be revoked if the contractors hired unauthorized aliens.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Cal. Lab. Code \xc2\xa71690(f) (Deering Supp. 1991); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71301.503(4), 1301.505(3) (1965\xe2\x80\x931983 Supp. Pamphlet); Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7658.405(1), 658.440(2)(d) (1987) (covering forestry workers).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1986, Congress (when enacting the Act now before us) focused directly upon the earlier federal agricultural labor contractor licensing system.  And it changed that earlier system by including a series of conforming amendments in the Act.  One amendment removes from the earlier statutes the specific prohibition against hiring unauthorized aliens.  It thereby makes agricultural labor contractors subject to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s similar general prohibition against such hiring.  IRCA \xc2\xa7101(b)(1)(C) (repealing AWPA \xc2\xa7106).  Another amendment takes from the Secretary of Labor most of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement powers in respect to the hiring of unauthorized aliens.  It thereby leaves agricultural labor contractors subject to the same single unified enforcement system that the immigration Act applies to all employers.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71853.  A third amendment, however, leaves with the Secretary of Labor the power to withdraw the federal registration certificate from an agricultural labor contractor that hired unauthorized aliens.  IRCA \xc2\xa7101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71813(a)(6).  Thus, the Act leaves this subset of employers (<em>i.e.</em>, agricultural labor contractors but not other employers) subject to a federal licensing scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So far, the conforming amendments make sense.  But have they not omitted an important matter?  Prior to 1986, States as well as the Federal Government could license agricultural labor contractors.  Should the 1986 statute not say whether Congress intended that dual system to continue?  The answer is that the 1986 Act does not omit this matter.  It answers the coexistence question directly with the parenthetical phrase we are now considering, namely, the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cother than through licensing and similar laws,\xe2\x80\x9d placed in the middle of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  That phrase refers to agricultural labor contractors, and it says that,\nin respect to those licensing schemes, dual state/federal licensing can continue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As of 1986, there were strong reasons for permitting that dual system to continue <em>in this specialized area</em>.  Dual enforcement had proved helpful in preventing particularly serious employment abuses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 128 Cong. Rec. 24090 (1982) (reflecting concerns that agricultural workers were \xe2\x80\x9choused in hovels; \xe2\x80\xa6 subjected to physical abuse and kept in virtual slavery\xe2\x80\x9d).  And because the contractors\xe2\x80\x99 business consists of providing labor forces, their hiring of authorized workers is closely related to their general fitness to do business.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 202, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1963) (explaining that farm labor contractor registration laws are needed to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible crew leaders\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cexploit[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 farmers\xe2\x80\x9d); Martin, Good Intentions Gone Awry: IRCA and U. S. Agriculture, 534 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. &amp; Soc. Sci. 44, 49 (1994) (describing how farmers who relied on contractors risked losing their labor forces to immigration raids).  Dual enforcement would not create a federal/state penalty disparity, for federal systems as well as state systems provide for license revocation.  Experience had shown that dual enforcement had not created any serious conflict or other difficulty.  And in light of the specialized nature and comparatively small set of businesses subject to dual enforcement, to permit licensing of that set of businesses would not seriously undermine the objectives of the Act or its pre-emption provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, it is not surprising that the legislative history of the 1986 Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision says that the licensing exception is about the licensing of agricultural labor contractors.  The House Report on the Act, referring to the licensing exception, states that the Committee did \xe2\x80\x9cnot intend to preempt licensing or \xe2\x80\x98fitness to do business laws,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>such as state farm labor contractor laws or forestry laws, which specifically require such licensee or contractor to refrain from hiring, recruiting or referring undocumented aliens</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93682, at 58 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s language, while not requiring this interpretation, is nonetheless consistent with limiting the scope of the phrase in this way.  Context can limit the application of the term \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d to particular<em> types</em> of licensing.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter itself limits the term to employment-related licensing.  And the Act\xe2\x80\x99s specific reference to those who \xe2\x80\x9crecruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with employment-related li-censing that focuses primarily upon labor contracting businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, reading the phrase as limited in scope to laws licensing businesses that recruit or refer workers for employment is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, with the relevant history, and with other statutory provisions in the Act.  That reading prevents state law from undermining the Act and from turning the pre-emption clause on its head.  That is why I consider it the better reading of the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another section of the Arizona statute requires \xe2\x80\x9cevery employer, after hiring an employee,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cverify the employment eligibility of the employee\xe2\x80\x9d through the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s E-Verify program.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93214.  This state provision makes participation in the federal E-Verify system <em>mandatory </em>for virtually all Arizona employers.  The federal law governing the E-Verify program, however, creates a program that is <em>voluntary.  </em>By making mandatory that which federal law seeks to make voluntary, the<em> </em>state provision stands as a significant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crosby</em>, 530 U. S., at 373 (quoting <em>Hines</em>, 312 U. S., at 67).  And it is consequently pre-empted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal statute itself makes clear that participation in the E-Verify program is voluntary.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s relevant section bears the title \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary Election to Participate in a Pilot Program.\xe2\x80\x9d  IIRIRA \xc2\xa7402, note following 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a, p.\xc2\xa0331.  A subsection bears the further title, \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary Election.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7402(a).  And within that subsection, the statute says that employers \xe2\x80\x9c<em>may </em>elect to participate.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The statute elsewhere requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \xe2\x80\x9cwidely publicize \xe2\x80\xa6 the voluntary nature\xe2\x80\x9d of the program.  \xc2\xa7402(d)(2); see also \xc2\xa7402(d)(3)(A) (requiring the designation of local officials to advertise the \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary nature\xe2\x80\x9d of the program).  It adds that employers may \xe2\x80\x9cterminate\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9celection\xe2\x80\x9d to participate by following certain procedures.  \xc2\xa7402(c)(3).  And it tells the Secretary of Homeland Security (as an earlier version told the Attorney General) that she \xe2\x80\x9cmay not require any person or other entity to participate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7402(a); see also \xc2\xa7402(e) (creating exceptions, none of which is applicable here, that require federal employers and certain others to participate in E-Verify or another pilot program).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress had strong reasons for insisting on the voluntary nature of the program.  E-Verify was conceived as, and remains, a pilot program.  Its database consists of tens of millions of Social Security and immigration records kept by the Federal Government.  These records are prone to error.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Office of the Inspector General, Social Security Administration, Congressional Response Report: Accuracy of the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Numident File 12 (2006) (hereinafter Social Security Report) (estimating that 3.3 million naturalized citizens are misclassified in a Social Security database used by E-Verify); GAO, Employment Verification: Federal Agencies Have Taken Steps to Improve E-Verify, but Significant Challenges Remain 16 (GAO\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x93146, 2010) (hereinafter GAO Report) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous [nonconfirmations] related to name inconsistencies \xe2\x80\xa6 remain an issue\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccan create the appearance of discrimination because of their disparate impact on certain cultural groups\xe2\x80\x9d).  And making the program mandatory would have been hugely expensive.  See <em>post</em>, at 16 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The E-Verify program is still a pilot program, as a matter of statute and practice.  See IIRIRA \xc2\xa7401; Letter from H. Couch to R. Stana (Dec. 8, 2010) (discussing aspects of E-Verify that have yet to be implemented).  The effects of the program\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to take account of, and correct for, potential errors remain uncertain.  Congress could decide that, based on the results of the pilot, E-Verify should become a mandatory program.  But it has not yet made that determination.  And in making that decision, it will have to face a number of questions: Will workers receiving tentative negative verdicts understand the possibility of administrative challenge?  Will they make the effort to invoke that process, say traveling from a farm to an urban Social Security office?  Will employers prove willing to undergo the financial burden of supporting a worker who might lose the challenge?  Will employers hesitate to train those workers during the time they bring their challenges?  Will employers simply hesitate to hire workers who might receive an initial negative verdict\xe2\x80\x94more likely those who look or sound foreign?  Or will they find ways to dismiss those workers?  These and other unanswered questions convinced Congress to make E-Verify a pilot program, to commission continuous study and evaluation, and to insist that participation be voluntary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In co-opting a federal program and changing the key terms under which Congress created that program, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory state law simply ignores both the federal language and the reasoning it reflects, thereby posing an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obstacle to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the objectives Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statute evinces.  <em>Crosby</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373 (quoting <em>Hines</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 67).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority reaches a contrary conclusion by pointing out (1) that Congress has renewed the E-Verify program several times, each time expanding its coverage, to the point where it now encompasses all 50 States; (2) that the E-Verify database has become more accurate; (3) that\nthe Executive Branch has itself mandated participation for federal contractors; and (4) that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language tells the Secretary of Homeland Security, <em>not the States, </em>to maintain the program as voluntary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The short, and, I believe, conclusive answers to these objections are: (1) Congress has kept the language of the statute\xe2\x80\x94and the voluntary nature of the program\xe2\x80\x94the same throughout its program renewals.  See 115 Stat. 2407; 117 Stat. 1944; \xc2\xa7547, 123 Stat. 2177.  And it is up to Congress, not to Arizona or this Court, to decide when participation in the program should cease to be voluntary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) The studies and reports have repeatedly found both (a) that the E-Verify program had achieved greater accuracy, but (b) that problems remain.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Social Security Report 11 (estimating that Social Security records contain 4.8 million \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrepancies that could require the numberholder to visit [the Social Security Administration] \xe2\x80\xa6 before employment eligibility would be confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d); GAO Report 19 (estimating that, if E-Verify were made mandatory nationwide, 164,000 newly hired workers each year would erroneously be adjudged ineligible to work because of name mismatches, as when the worker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst or last name is incorrectly spelled in government databases or on identification documents\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it is up to Congress, not to Arizona or this Court, to determine when the federally designed and federally run E-Verify program is ready for expansion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) Federal contractors are a special group of employers, subject to many special requirements, who enter voluntarily into a special relation with the Government.  For the Federal Government to mandate that a special group participate in the E-Verify program tells us little or nothing about the effects of a State\xe2\x80\x99s mandating that nearly every employer within the State participate\xe2\x80\x94as Arizona has done.  And insofar as we have not determined whether the Executive was authorized by Congress to mandate E-Verify for federal contractors, it says nothing about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4) There is no reason to imply negatively from language telling the Secretary <em>not </em>to make the program mandatory, permission for the States to do so.  There is no presumption that a State may modify the operation of a uniquely federal program like E-Verify.  Cf. <em>Buckman Co.</em> v. <em>Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Legal Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/341/index.html">531 U. S. 341</a>, 347\xe2\x80\x93348 (2001); <em>Boyle</em> v. <em>United Technologies Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/500/index.html">487 U.

The remaining federal statutory language makes clear the voluntary nature of the E-Verify program.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s plan would undermine that federal objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons I would hold that the federal Act, including its E-Verify provisions, pre-empts Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s state law.  With respect, I dissent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary holdings.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963487">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOTOMAYOR, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OFAMERICA V.

S. 137</a>, 147 (2002).  The Court reads IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause\xe2\x80\x94which preserves from pre-emption state \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2)\xe2\x80\x94to permit States to determine for themselves whether someone has employed an unauthorized alien so long as they do so in conjunction with licensing sanctions.  This reading of the saving clause cannot be reconciled with the rest of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive scheme.  Having constructed a federal mechanism for determining whether someone has knowingly employed an unauthorized alien, and having withheld from the States the information necessary to make that determination, Congress could not plausibly have intended for the saving clause to operate in the way the majority reads it to do.  When viewed in context, the saving clause can only be understood to preserve States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to impose licensing sanctions after a final federal determination that a person has violated IRCA by knowingly employing an unauthorized alien.  Because the Legal Arizona Workers Act instead creates a separate state mechanism for Arizona state courts to determine whether a person has employed an unauthorized alien, I would hold that it falls outside the saving clause and is pre-empted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would also hold that federal law pre-empts the provision of the Arizona Act making mandatory the use of \nE-Verify, the federal electronic verification system.  By requiring Arizona employers to use E-Verify, Arizona has effectively made a decision for Congress regarding use of a federal resource, in contravention of the significant policy objectives motivating Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to make participation in the E-Verify program voluntary.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin with the plain text of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption clause.  IRCA expressly pre-empts States from \xe2\x80\x9cimposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Arizona Act, all agree, imposes civil sanctions upon those who employ unauthorized aliens.  The Act thus escapes express pre-emption only if it falls within IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s parenthetical saving clause for \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The saving clause is hardly a paragon of textual clarity.  IRCA does not define \xe2\x80\x9clicensing,\xe2\x80\x9d nor does it use the word \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d in any other provision.  Laws that impose sanctions by means of licensing exist in many forms.  Some permit authorities to take action with respect to licenses upon finding that a licensee has engaged in prohibited conduct.  See, e.g.</em>, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x93210(A)(1) (West 2011) (liquor licenses may be suspended or revoked if the licensing authority determines after notice and a hearing that repeated acts of violence have occurred on the licensed premises).  Others, more narrowly, permit authorities to take such action following a pre-existing determination by another authorized body that the licensee has violated another provision of law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x93202(D) (liquor licenses may not be renewed to persons who have been convicted of felonies within the past five years).  That both types of laws might be defined in some contexts as licensing laws does not necessarily mean that Congress intended the saving clause to encompass both types.  See <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cA word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>FCC</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Inc.</em>, 562 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 2, and n. 1 (citing 12 such laws).  California, for example, prohibited the knowing employment of an alien \xe2\x80\x9cwho is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9csuch employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers,\xe2\x80\x9d and made violations punishable by fines of $200 to $500.  1971 Cal.

As the majority explains, IRCA makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for a person or other entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A); <em>ante</em>, at 3.  IRCA also requires employers to verify that they have reviewed documents establishing an employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for employment.  See \xc2\xa71324a(b); <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  These two provisions are the foundation of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman</em>, 535 U. S., at 147.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress made explicit its intent that IRCA be enforced uniformly.  IRCA declares that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the sense of the Congress that \xe2\x80\xa6 the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously <em>and uniformly</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7115, 100 Stat. 3384 (emphasis added).  Congress structured IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions in a number of ways to accomplish this goal of uniform enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, and most obviously, Congress expressly displaced the myriad state laws that imposed civil and criminal sanctions on employers who hired unauthorized aliens.  See \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2); see also H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93682, at 58 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe penalties contained in this legislation are intended to specifically preempt any state or local laws providing civil fines and/or criminal sanctions on the hiring, recruitment or referral of undocumented aliens\xe2\x80\x9d).

S. 218</a>, 230 (1947)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress centralized in the Federal Government enforcement of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the knowing employment of unauthorized aliens.  IRCA instructs the Attorney General to designate a specialized federal agency unit whose \xe2\x80\x9cprimary duty\xe2\x80\x9d will be to prosecute violations of IRCA.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(1)(D).  IRCA also instructs the Attorney General to establish procedures for receiving complaints, investigating complaints having \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial probability of validity,\xe2\x80\x9d and investigating other violations.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(1); see also 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.9 (2010).  Upon concluding that a person has violated IRCA, the Attorney General must provide the person with notice and an opportunity for a hearing before a federal administrative law judge (ALJ). 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(e)(3)(A), (B).  If the person does not request a hearing, the Attorney General may impose a final, nonappealable order requiring payment of sanctions.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(3)(B).  If the person requests a hearing, the ALJ is required to hold a hearing and, upon finding that the person has violated IRCA, must order the payment of sanctions.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(3)(C).  The ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s order is the final agency order, unless the affected person requests and obtains further administrative appellate review.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(7); see also 28 CFR \xc2\xa768.54 (2010).  IRCA grants immigration officers and ALJs \xe2\x80\x9creasonable access to \nexamine evidence of any person or entity being investigated\xe2\x80\x9d and provides them with extensive subpoena powers.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(2).  And the immigration officers investigating suspected violations obviously have access to the relevant federal information concerning the work authorization status of the employee in question.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Congress provided persons \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affected\xe2\x80\x9d by an agency order with a right of review in the federal courts of appeals.  \xc2\xa71324a(e)(8); see also \xc2\xa71324a(e)(9) (directing the Attorney General in cases of noncompliance to file suit in federal district court to enforce a final order imposing sanctions); \xc2\xa71324a(f) (authorizing the Attorney General to pursue injunctive relief and criminal sanctions in federal district court).  In this way, Congress ensured that administrative orders finding violations of IRCA would be reviewed by federal judges with experience adjudicating immigration-related matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, Congress created a uniquely federal system by which employers must verify the work authorization status of new hires.  Under this system, an employer must attest under penalty of perjury on a form designated by the Attorney General (the I\xe2\x80\x939 form) that it has examined enumerated identification documents to verify that a new hire is not an unauthorized alien.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(1)(A); see also 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.2; <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Good-faith compliance with this verification requirement entitles an employer to an affirmative defense if charged with violating IRCA.  \xc2\xa71324a(a)(3); see also H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93682, at 57.  Notably, however, IRCA prohibits use of the I\xe2\x80\x939 form for any purpose other than enforcement of IRCA and various provisions of federal criminal law.  \xc2\xa71324a(b)(5); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.2(b)(4).  Use of the I\xe2\x80\x939 form is thus limited to <em>federal</em> proceedings, as the majority acknowledges.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Congress created no mechanism for States to access information regarding an alien\xe2\x80\x99s work authorization status for purposes of enforcing state prohibitions on the employment of unauthorized aliens.  The relevant sections of IRCA make no provision for the sharing of work authorization information between federal and state authorities even though access to that information would be critical to a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to determine whether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.  In stark contrast, a separate provision in the same title of IRCA creates a verification system by which States can ascertain the immigration status of aliens applying for benefits under programs such as Medicaid and the food stamp program.  See IRCA \xc2\xa7121(a)(1)(C), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71320b\xe2\x80\x937(d)(3).  The existence of a verification system in one provision of IRCA, coupled with its absence in the provision governing employment of unauthorized aliens, suggests strongly that Congress did not contemplate any role for the States in adjudicating questions regarding employment of unauthorized aliens.  Cf. <em>Bates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/23/index.html">522 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71373(c), requiring the Government to respond to certain inquiries from state agencies.  Section 1373(c), however, merely requires the Government to respond to inquiries from state agencies \xe2\x80\x9cseeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not require the provision of information regarding an alien\xe2\x80\x99s work authorization status, which is not necessar-\nily synonymous with immigration status.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.12(c) (identifying categories of <em>legal</em> aliens \xe2\x80\x9cwho must apply for employment authorization\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Arizona has not identified any federal statute or regulation requiring the Federal Government to provide information regarding an alien\xe2\x80\x99s work authorization status to a State.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  More importantly, \xc2\xa71373(c) was enacted in 1996, see \xc2\xa7642(c), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93707, and thus says nothing about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent when it enacted IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause a decade earlier.  See <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/227/index.html">526 U.

Focusing primarily on the text of the saving clause, Arizona and the majority read the clause to permit States to determine themselves whether a person has employed an unauthorized alien, so long as they do so in connection with licensing sanctions.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  This interpretation overlooks the broader statutory context and renders the statutory scheme \xe2\x80\x9c[in]coherent and [in]consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Ali</em>, 552 U. S., at 222.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the saving clause, state prosecutors decide whether to commence licensing-related proceedings against a person suspected of employing an unauthorized alien.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding also permits state courts and other tribunals to adjudicate the question whether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.  The Arizona Act illustrates the problems with reading the saving clause to permit such state action.  The Act directs prosecutors to verify an employee\xe2\x80\x99s work authorization with the Federal Government pursuant to \xc2\xa71373(c), <em>e.g.</em>, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(B) (West Supp. 2010), and the state court \xe2\x80\x9cshall consider only the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s determination pursuant to [\xc2\xa7]1373(c)\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(H).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Putting aside the question whether \xc2\xa71373(c) actually provides access to work authorization information, \xc2\xa71373(c) did not exist when IRCA was enacted in 1986.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9.  Arizona has not identified any avenue by which States could have accessed work authorization information in the first decade of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s existence.  The absence of any such avenue at the time of IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment speaks volumes as to how Congress would have understood the saving clause to operate: If States had no access to information regarding the work authorization status of aliens, how could state courts have accurately adjudicated the question whether an employer had employed an unauthorized alien?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona Act\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa71373(c) highlights the anomalies inherent in state schemes that purport to adjudicate whether an employee is an authorized alien.  Even when Arizona prosecutors obtain information regarding \nan alien\xe2\x80\x99s <em>immigration</em> status pursuant to \xc2\xa71373(c), the prosecutors and state court will have to determine the significance of that information to an alien\xe2\x80\x99s <em>work authorization</em> status, which will often require deciding techni-\ncal questions of immigration law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7274a.12(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c) (dividing 62 different classes of aliens into those authorized for employment incident to immigration status, those authorized for employment with a specific employer incident to immigration status, and those who must apply for work authorization).  And, as discussed above, that information may not shed light at all on an alien\xe2\x80\x99s work authorization status, which is oftentimes distinct from immigration status.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8, and n.\xc2\xa05.  As a result, in many cases state decisions\xe2\x80\x94made by prosecutors and courts with no or little experience in federal immigration law\xe2\x80\x94will rest on less-than-complete or inaccurate information, \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ing] enforcement risks not present in the federal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  I can discern no reason why Congress would have intended for state courts inexperienced in immigration matters to adjudicate, in the context of licensing sanctions, the very same question that IRCA commits to federal officers, ALJs, and the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally problematic is the fact that employers charged under a state enforcement scheme with hiring unauthorized aliens are foreclosed from using I\xe2\x80\x939 forms in their defense in the state proceedings.  Like IRCA, the Arizona Act confers an affirmative defense on employers who comply in good faith with IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s verification requirement.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(J), 23\xe2\x80\x93212.01(J).  As discussed above, however, IRCA prohibits an employer from using the I\xe2\x80\x939 form to establish that affirmative defense under Arizona law.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(b)(5); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.2(b)(4).  Not to worry, the majority says: The employer can establish the affirmative defense through office policies and testimony of employees.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa09.  But Congress made the I\xe2\x80\x939 verification system and accompanying good-faith defense central to IRCA.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93682, at 60 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n effective verification procedure, combined with an affirmative defense for those who in good faith follow the procedure, is essential\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the importance of this procedure, if Congress in fact intended for state courts to adjudicate whether a person had employed an unauthorized alien in connection with licensing sanctions, why would it have prohibited that person from using the I\xe2\x80\x939 form\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe employer\xe2\x80\x99s most effective evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9 (Breyer, J., dissenting)\xe2\x80\x94in the state-court proceeding?  The question answers itself: Congress intended no such thing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express goal of \xe2\x80\x9cunifor[m]\xe2\x80\x9d enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9cthe immigration laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d IRCA \xc2\xa7115, 100 Stat. 3384, I cannot believe that Congress intended for the 50 States and countless localities to implement their own distinct enforcement and adjudication procedures for deciding whether employers have employed unauthorized aliens.  Reading the sav-ing clause as the majority does subjects employers to a patchwork of enforcement schemes similar to the one that Congress sought to displace when it enacted IRCA.  Having carefully constructed a uniform federal scheme for determining whether a person has employed an unauthorized alien, Congress could not plausibly have meant to create such a gaping hole in that scheme through the undefined, parenthetical phrase \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the statutory scheme as a whole defeats Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the saving clause.  Congress would not sensibly have permitted States to determine for themselves whether a person has employed an unauthorized alien, while at the same time creating a specialized federal procedure for making such a determination, withholding from the States the information necessary to make such a determination, and precluding use of the I\xe2\x80\x939 forms in nonfederal proceedings.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Locke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/89/index.html">529 U. S. 89</a>, 106 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe decline to give broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To render IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause consistent with the statutory scheme, I read the saving clause to permit States to impose licensing sanctions following a final federal determination that a person has violated \xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A) by knowingly hiring, recruiting, or referring for a fee an unauthorized alien.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This interpretation both is faithful to the saving clause\xe2\x80\x99s text, see <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and best reconciles the saving clause with IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccareful regulatory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Locke</em>, 529 U. S., at 106.  It also makes sense as a practical matter.  In enacting IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption clause, Congress vested in the Federal Government the authority to impose civil and criminal sanctions on persons who employ unauthorized aliens.  Licensing and other types of business-related permissions are typically a matter of state law, however.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kamen</em> v. <em>Kemper Financial Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/90/index.html">500 U. S. 90</a>, 98 (1991) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]orporation law\xe2\x80\x9d is an area traditionally \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned by state-law standards\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co.</em> v. <em>Forty-One Thirty-Six Wilcox Bldg.

S. 120</a>, 127 (1937) (\xe2\x80\x9cHow long and upon what terms a state-created corporation may continue to exist is a matter exclusively of state power\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, if Congress wanted to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that a full range of sanctions [was] available to be used against businesses that employ unauthorized aliens,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 37, Congress had to authorize the States and localities to impose licensing sanctions following a federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not mean to suggest that the mere existence of a comprehensive federal scheme necessarily reveals a congressional intent to oust state remedies.  Cf. <em>English</em> v. <em>General Elec. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/72/index.html">496 U. S. 72</a>, 87 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mere existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme \xe2\x80\xa6 does not by itself imply pre-emption of state remedies\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>New York State Dept. of Social Servs.</em> v. <em>Dublino</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/405/index.html">413 U. S. 405</a>, 415 (1973) (rejecting the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cpre-emption is to be inferred merely from the comprehensive character of the federal [program]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, Congress has made clear its intent to oust state civil and criminal remedies; the sole question is the scope of the saving clause\xe2\x80\x99s exception for \xe2\x80\x9clicensing and similar laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  The comprehensive scheme established by Congress necessarily informs the scope of this clause.  For all the reasons stated, the only interpretation of that clause that is consistent with the rest of the statute is that it preserves the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to impose licensing sanctions after a final federal determination that a person has violated IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the knowing employment of unauthorized aliens.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under my construction of the saving clause, the Arizona Act cannot escape pre-emption.  The Act authorizes Arizona county attorneys to commence actions charging an employer with having employed an unauthorized alien.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(D), 23\xe2\x80\x93212.01(D).  Arizona state courts must find that an employer has employed an unauthorized alien before imposing the sanctions enumerated in the Act.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93212(F), 23\xe2\x80\x93212.01(F).  Because the Act\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions are not premised on a final federal determination that an employer has violated IRCA, I would hold that the Act does not fall within IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause and is therefore pre-empted.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the conclusion reached by Justice Breyer in Part IV of his dissenting opinion that federal law impliedly pre-empts the provision in the Arizona Act requiring all Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify program.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93214.  I also agree with much of his reasoning.  I write separately to offer a few additional observations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have recently recognized, that a state law makes mandatory something that federal law makes voluntary does not mean, in and of itself, that the state law \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crosby</em> v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/363/index.html">530 U. S. 363</a>, 373 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See <em>Williamson</em> v. <em>Mazda Motor of America, Inc.</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932) (concluding that a federal regulation permitting manufacturers to choose between two seatbelt options did not pre-empt state tort liability based on a decision to install one of those options); see also <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mere fact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a choice between options is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, however, is readily distinguishable from cases like <em>Williamson</em>, in which state law regulates relationships between private parties.  Here, the Arizona Act directly regulates the relationship between the Federal Government and private parties by mandating use of a federally created and administered resource.  This case thus implicates the \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely federal interes[t]\xe2\x80\x9d in managing use of a federal resource.  <em>Boyle</em> v. <em>United Technologies Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/500/index.html">487 U.

In addition to those discussed by Justice Breyer, see <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319 (dissenting opinion), I note that Congress considered the cost of a mandatory program.  In 2003, when Congress elected to expand E-Verify to all 50 States but declined to require its use, it cited a congressionally mandated report concluding that the annual cost of the pilot program was $6 million, the annual cost of a nationwide voluntary program would be $11 million, and the annual cost of a nationwide mandatory program would be $11.7 <em>billion</em>.

A more recent re-port prepared for the Department of Homeland Security similarly noted the costs associated with mandatory use of E-Verify.  See Westat, Findings of the E-Verify\xc2\xae Program Evaluation 224 (2009) (observing that the SSA estimated that it would have to hire an additional 1,500 field staff \nto handle a mandatory national program); <em>id.</em>, at 251 (re-commending that any expansion of E-Verify take place gradually \xe2\x80\x9cto allow the Federal government adequate time to hire and train the new staff required to run such a program\xe2\x80\x9d).

The Committee\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthis legislation\xe2\x80\x9d is, of course, a reference to IRCA, and only federal officers, ALJs, and courts have authority under IRCA to find that a person has violated the statute\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My reading is also consistent with, though not compelled by, the provisions in IRCA that amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583.  As Justice Breyer discusses in detail, see <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315 (dissenting opinion), AWPA requires entities to secure a certificate of registration from the Department of Labor before engaging in any \xe2\x80\x9cfarm labor contracting activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  AWPA \xc2\xa7101, 96 Stat. 2587, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71811(a).  Before 1986, AWPA prohibited farm labor contractors from hiring unauthorized aliens, and it permitted the Department of Labor to institute administrative proceedings to enforce this prohibition.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7103(a)(3), 103(b), 106(a), 96 Stat. 2588\xe2\x80\x932590.  In IRCA, Congress repealed this pro-hibition, IRCA \xc2\xa7101(b)(1)(C), but authorized the Secretary of Labor to withdraw a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s federal registration certificate upon a finding of an IRCA violation, IRCA \xc2\xa7101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 100 Stat. 3372, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71813(a)(6).  Thus, IRCA made AWPA\xe2\x80\x99s licensing sanctions turn on a prior federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because I believe that the Arizona Act does not fall within IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause for this reason, I have no reason to consider the sepa-\nrate question whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d sweeps too broadly.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311, with <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Mazda Motor of America, Inc.</em>, 562 U.
