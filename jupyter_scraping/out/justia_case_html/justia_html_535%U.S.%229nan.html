In that case, the Fifth Circuit said:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The fact that Judge Barbier\'s name was listed on a motion to file an amicus brief which asserted similar allegations against tobacco companies to the ones made in this case may lead a reasonable person to doubt his impartiality. Also, Judge Barbier was listed on this filing with the attorney who is currently representing the Republic of Panama. The trial judge\'s assertions that he did not participate directly in the writing or researching of the amicus brief do not dissipate the doubts that a reasonable person would probably have about the court\'s impartiality. We acknowledge that this is a close case for recusal." 217 F. 3d, at 347.</p></blockquote><p>Judge Parker concurred, agreeing that the court was bound by its decision in <i>Republic of Panama I, </i>but arguing that that decision was "erroneous because it requires recusal on the basis of a judge\'s public statements on the law made prior to becoming a judge ....

The Fifth Circuit reached the conclusion that recusal was required because it considered what a reasonable person would believe <i>without </i>knowing (or giving due weight to the fact) that the judge\'s name was added mistakenly and without his knowledge to a <i>pro forma </i>motion to file an <i>amicus </i>brief in a separate controversy.
