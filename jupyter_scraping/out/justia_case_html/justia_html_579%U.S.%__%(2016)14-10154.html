When law enforcement officials later investigated Voisine for killing a bald eagle, they learned that he owned a rifle.  After a background check turned up Voisine\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction under \xc2\xa7207, the Government charged him with violating \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  Petitioner William Armstrong pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife in violation of a Maine domestic violence law making it a misdemeanor to commit an assault prohibited by \xc2\xa7207 against a family or household member.  While searching Armstrong\xe2\x80\x99s home as part of a narcotics investigation a few years later, law enforcement officers discovered six guns and a large quantity of ammunition.  Armstrong was also charged under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  Both men argued that they were not subject to \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition because their prior convictions could have been based on reckless, rather than knowing or intentional, conduct and thus did not quality as misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.  The District Court rejected those claims, and each petitioner pleaded guilty.  The First Circuit affirmed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9can offense with a <i>mens rea</i> of recklessness may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x98misdemeanor crime of violence\xe2\x80\x99 under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).\xe2\x80\x9d  Voisine and Armstrong filed a joint petition for certiorari, and their case was remanded for further consideration in light of <i>Castleman.</i>  The First Circuit again upheld the convictions on the same ground.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A reckless domestic assault qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0That conclusion follows from the statutory text.  Nothing in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cuse.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) distinguishes between domestic assaults committed knowingly or intentionally and those committed recklessly.  Dictionaries consistently define the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d to mean the \xe2\x80\x9cact of employing\xe2\x80\x9d something.  Accordingly, the force involved in a qualifying assault must be volitional; an involuntary motion, even a powerful one, is not naturally described as an active employment of force.  See <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  But nothing about the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d demands that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm, as compared with the understanding that it is substantially likely to do so.  Nor does <i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, which held that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force excludes accidents.  Reckless conduct, which requires the conscious disregard of a known risk, is not an accident: It involves a deliberate decision to endanger another.  The relevant text thus supports prohibiting petitioners, and others with similar criminal records, from possessing firearms.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0So too does the relevant history.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) in 1996 to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors\xe2\x80\x94just like those convicted of felonies\xe2\x80\x94from owning guns.  Then, as now, a significant majority of jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9434 States plus the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x94defined such misdemeanor offenses to include the reckless infliction of bodily harm.  In targeting those laws, Congress thus must have known it was sweeping in some persons who had engaged in reckless conduct.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Bailey</i>, 9 Pet. 238, 256.  Indeed, that was part of the point: to apply the federal firearms restriction to those abusers, along with all others, covered by the States\xe2\x80\x99 ordinary misdemeanor assault laws.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading risks rendering \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) broadly inoperative in the 35 jurisdictions with assault laws extending to recklessness.  Consider Maine\xe2\x80\x99s law, which criminalizes \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly\xe2\x80\x9d injuring another.  Assuming that statute defines a single crime, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) requires at least a knowing <i>mens rea</i> would mean that<i> no </i>conviction obtained under that law could qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  In <i>Castleman</i>, the Court declined to construe \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) so as to render \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) ineffective in 10 States.  All the more so here, where petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view would jeopardize \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s force in several times that many.

The question presented here is whether misdemeanor assault convictions for reckless (as contrasted to knowing or intentional) conduct trigger the statutory firearms ban.  We hold that they do.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) some 20 years ago to \xe2\x80\x9cclose [a] dangerous loophole\xe2\x80\x9d in the gun control laws.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 2) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hayes</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415,\n426 (2009)\n).  An existing provision already barred convicted felons from possessing firearms.  See \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) (1994 ed.).  But many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies, notwithstanding the harmfulness of their conduct.  See <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  And \xe2\x80\x9c[f]irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hayes, </i>555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427.  Accordingly, Congress added \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to prohibit any person convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d from possessing any gun or ammunition with a connection to interstate commerce.  And it defined that phrase, in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), to include a misdemeanor under federal, state, or tribal law, committed by a person with a specified domestic relationship with the victim, that \xe2\x80\x9chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two Terms ago, this Court considered the scope of that definition in a case involving a conviction for a knowing or intentional assault.

In <i>Castleman</i>, we initially held that the word \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) bears its common-law meaning, and so is broad enough to include offensive touching.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4).

But we expressly left open whether a reckless assault also qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force\xe2\x80\x94so that a misdemeanor conviction for such conduct would trigger \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s firearms ban.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa08 (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa08).  The two cases before us now raise that issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner Stephen Voisine pleaded guilty in 2004 to assaulting his girlfriend in violation of \xc2\xa7207 of the Maine Criminal Code, which makes it a misdemeanor to \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly cause[\xc2\xa0] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Me.

To commit an assault recklessly is to take that action with a certain state of mind (or <i>mens rea</i>)\xe2\x80\x94in the dominant formulation, to \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously disregard[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d a substantial risk that the conduct will cause harm to another.  ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02(2)(c) (1962); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa735(3) (Supp. 2015) (adopting that definition); see <i>Farmer</i> v. <i>Brennan</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 825\n\xe2\x80\x93837 (1994) (noting that a person acts recklessly only when he disregards a substantial risk of harm \xe2\x80\x9cof which he is aware\xe2\x80\x9d).  For purposes of comparison, to commit an assault knowingly or intentionally (the latter, to add yet another adverb, sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully\xe2\x80\x9d) is to act with another state of mind respecting that act\xe2\x80\x99s consequences\xe2\x80\x94in the first case, to be \xe2\x80\x9caware that [harm] is practically certain\xe2\x80\x9d and, in the second, to have that result as a \xe2\x80\x9cconscious object.\xe2\x80\x9d  Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72.02 (2)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b); Me.

Congress defined that phrase to include crimes that necessarily involve the \xe2\x80\x9cuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  Reckless assaults, no less than the knowing or intentional ones we addressed in <i>Castleman</i>, satisfy that definition.  Further, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) in order to prohibit domestic abusers convicted under run-of-the-mill misdemeanor assault and battery laws from possessing guns.  Because fully two-thirds of such state laws extend to recklessness, construing \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to exclude crimes committed with that state of mind would substantially undermine the provision\xe2\x80\x99s design.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nothing in the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is the only statutory language either party thinks relevant\xe2\x80\x94indicates that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) applies exclusively to knowing or intentional domestic assaults.  Recall that under \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), an offense counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d only if it has, as an element, the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force.  Dictionaries consistently define the noun \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d to mean the \xe2\x80\x9cact of employing\xe2\x80\x9d something.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1954) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ct of employing anything\xe2\x80\x9d); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2097 (2d ed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cact of employing, using, or putting into service\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ct of employing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  On that common understanding, the force involved in a qualifying assault must be volitional; an involuntary motion, even a powerful one, is not naturally described as an active employment of force.  See <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he word \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 conveys the idea that the thing used (here, \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99) has been made the user\xe2\x80\x99s instrument\xe2\x80\x9d (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  But the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d does not demand that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm, as compared with the understanding that it is substantially likely to do so.  Or, otherwise said, that word is indifferent as to whether the actor has the mental state of intention, knowledge, or recklessness with respect to the harmful consequences of his volitional conduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider a couple of examples to see the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d in this context.  If a person with soapy hands loses his grip on a plate, which then shatters and cuts his wife, the person has not \xe2\x80\x9cuse[d]\xe2\x80\x9d physical force in common parlance.  But now suppose a person throws a plate in anger against the wall near where his wife is standing.  That hurl counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force even if the husband did not know for certain (or have as an object), but only recognized a substantial risk, that a shard from the plate would ricochet and injure his wife.  Similarly, to spin out a scenario discussed at oral argument, if a person lets slip a door that he is trying to hold open for his girlfriend, he has not actively employed (\xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d) force even though the result is to hurt her.  But if he slams the door shut with his girlfriend following close behind, then he has done so\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether he thinks it absolutely sure or only quite likely that he will catch her fingers in the jamb.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (counsel for petitioners acknowledging that this example involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d).  Once again, the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d does not exclude from \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s compass an act of force carried out in conscious disregard of its substantial risk of causing harm.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, nothing in <i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2004)\n, suggests a different conclusion\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, that \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d marks a dividing line between reckless and knowing conduct.  See Brief for Petitioners 18\xe2\x80\x9322.  In that decision, this Court addressed a statutory definition similar to \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A): there, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of physical force against the person or property of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.  That provision excludes \xe2\x80\x9cmerely accidental\xe2\x80\x9d conduct, <i>Leocal </i>held, because \xe2\x80\x9cit is [not] natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 9.  For example, the Court stated, one \xe2\x80\x9cwould not ordinarily say a person \xe2\x80\x98use[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. physical force against\xe2\x80\x99 another by stumbling and falling into him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i> That reasoning fully accords with our analysis here.  Conduct like stumbling (or in our hypothetical, dropping a plate) is a true accident, and so too the injury arising from it; hence the difficulty of describing that conduct as the \xe2\x80\x9cactive employment\xe2\x80\x9d of force.  <i>Ibid.  </i>But the same is not true of reckless behavior\xe2\x80\x94acts undertaken with awareness of their substantial risk of causing injury (in our contrasting hypo, hurling the plate).  The harm such conduct causes is the result of a deliberate decision to endanger another\xe2\x80\x94no more an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d than if the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cpractically certain.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 4 (comparing reckless and knowing acts).  And indeed, <i>Leocal </i>itself recognized the distinction between accidents and recklessness, specifically reserving the issue whether the definition in \xc2\xa716 embraces reckless conduct, see 543 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x94as we now hold \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) does.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d contains no exclusion for convictions based on reckless behavior.  A person who assaults another recklessly \xe2\x80\x9cuse[s]\xe2\x80\x9d force, no less than one who carries out that same action knowingly or intentionally.  The relevant text thus supports prohibiting petitioners, and others with similar criminal records, from possessing firearms.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">So too does the relevant history.  As explained earlier, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) in 1996 to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors\xe2\x80\x94just like those convicted of felonies\xe2\x80\x94from owning guns.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932; <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 6); <i>Hayes</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 426\xe2\x80\x93427.  Then, as now, a significant majority of jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9434 States plus the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x94defined such misdemeanor offenses to include the reckless infliction of bodily harm.  See Brief for United States 7a\xe2\x80\x9319a (collecting statutes).  That agreement was no coincidence.  Sev-eral decades earlier, the Model Penal Code had taken the position that a <i>mens rea</i> of recklessness should generally suffice to establish criminal liability, including for assault.  See \xc2\xa72.02(3), Comments 4\xe2\x80\x935, at 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (\xe2\x80\x9cpurpose, knowledge, and recklessness are properly the basis for\xe2\x80\x9d such liability); \xc2\xa7211.1 (defining assault to include \xe2\x80\x9cpurposely, knowingly, or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d).  States quickly incorporated that view into their misdemeanor assault and battery statutes.  So in linking \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to those laws, Congress must have known it was sweeping in some persons who had engaged in reckless conduct.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Bailey</i>, 9 Pet. 238, 256 (1835) (Story, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress must be presumed to have legislated under this known state of the laws\xe2\x80\x9d).  And indeed, that was part of the point: to apply firearms restrictions to those abusers, along with all others, whom the States\xe2\x80\x99 ordinary misdemeanor assault laws covered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What is more, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading risks rendering \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) broadly inoperative in the 35 jurisdictions with assault laws extending to recklessness\xe2\x80\x94that is, inapplicable even to persons who commit that crime knowingly or intentionally.  Consider Maine\xe2\x80\x99s statute, which (in typical fashion) makes it a misdemeanor to \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly\xe2\x80\x9d injure another.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa7207(1)(A).  Assuming that provision defines a single crime (which happens to list alternative mental states)\xe2\x80\x94and accepting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) requires at least a knowing <i>mens rea</i>\xe2\x80\x94then, under <i>Descamps </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), <i>no</i> conviction obtained under Maine\xe2\x80\x99s statute could qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5) (If a state crime \xe2\x80\x9csweeps more broadly\xe2\x80\x9d than the federally defined one, a conviction for the state offense \xe2\x80\x9ccannot count\xe2\x80\x9d as a predicate, no matter what <i>mens rea</i> the defendant actually had).  So in the 35 jurisdictions like Maine, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading risks allowing domestic abusers of all mental states to evade \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s firearms ban.  In <i>Castleman</i>, we declined to construe \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) so as to render \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) ineffective in 10 States.  See 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  All the more so here, where petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view would jeopardize \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s force in several times that many.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners respond that we should ignore the assault and battery laws actually on the books when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  In construing the statute, they urge, we should look instead to how the common law defined those crimes in an earlier age.  See Brief for Petitioners 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  And that approach, petitioners claim, would necessitate reversing their convictions because the common law \xe2\x80\x9crequired a <i>mens rea</i> greater than recklessness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But we see no reason to wind the clock back so far.  Once again: Congress passed \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to take guns out of the hands of abusers convicted under the misdemeanor assault laws then in general use in the States.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 8.  And by that time, a substantial majority of jurisdictions, following the Model Penal Code\xe2\x80\x99s lead, had abandoned the common law\xe2\x80\x99s approach to <i>mens rea</i> in drafting and interpreting their assault and battery statutes.  Indeed, most had gone down that road decades before.  That was the backdrop against which Congress was legislating.  Nothing suggests that, in enacting \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Congress wished to look beyond that real world to a common-law precursor that had largely expired.  To the contrary, such an approach would have undermined Congress\xe2\x80\x99s aim by tying the ban on firearms possession not to the laws under which abusers are prosecuted but instead to a legal anachronism.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And anyway, we would not know how to resolve whether recklessness sufficed for a battery conviction at common law.  Recklessness was not a word in the common law\xe2\x80\x99s standard lexicon, nor an idea in its conceptual framework; only in the mid- to late-1800\xe2\x80\x99s did courts begin to address reckless behavior in those terms.  See Hall, Assault and Battery by the Reckless Motorist, 31 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 133, 138\xe2\x80\x93139 (1940).  The common law traditionally used a variety of overlapping and, frankly, confusing phrases to describe culpable mental states\xe2\x80\x94among them, specific intent, general intent, presumed intent, willfulness, and malice.  See, <i>e.g., Morissette</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246,\n252 (1952)\n; Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02, Comment 1, at 230.  Whether and where conduct that we would today describe as reckless fits into that obscure scheme is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess: Neither petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 citations, nor the Government\xe2\x80\x99s competing ones, have succeeded in resolving that counterfactual question.  And that indeterminacy confirms our conclusion that Congress had no thought of incorporating the common law\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of <i>mens rea</i> into \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  That provision instead corresponds to the ordinary misdemeanor assault and battery laws used to prosecute domestic abuse, regardless of how their mental state requirements might\xe2\x80\x94or, then again, might not\xe2\x80\x94conform to the common law\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The federal ban on firearms possession applies to any person with a prior misdemeanor conviction for the \xe2\x80\x9cuse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against a domestic relation.  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  That language, naturally read, encompasses acts of force undertaken recklessly\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>with conscious disregard of a substantial risk of harm.  And the state-law backdrop to that provision, which included misdemeanor assault statutes covering reckless conduct in a significant majority of jurisdictions, indicates that Congress meant just what it said.  Each petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s possession of a gun, following a conviction under Maine law for abusing a domestic partner, therefore violates \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).

Courts have sometimes given those two statutory definitions divergent readings in light of differences in their contexts and purposes, and we do not foreclose that possibility with respect to their required mental states.  Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2014) (slip op., at 6, n.\xc2\xa04) (interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) to encompass any offensive touching, while acknowledging that federal appeals courts have usually read the same term in \xc2\xa716 to reach only \xe2\x80\x9cviolent force\xe2\x80\x9d).  All we say here is that <i>Leocal</i>\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of accidental conduct from a definition hinging on the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force is in no way inconsistent with our inclusion of reckless conduct in a similarly worded provision.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0As petitioners observe, this Court looked to the common law in <i>Castleman </i>to define the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).

Because mere recklessness is sufficient to sustain a conviction under \xc2\xa7207, a conviction does not necessarily involve the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of physical force, and thus, does not trigger \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on firearm possession.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Three features of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) establish that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d requires intentional conduct.  First, the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d in that provision is best read to require intentional conduct.  As the majority recognizes, the noun \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98act of employing\xe2\x80\x99 something.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5 (quoting dictionaries).  A \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act of employing a thing for any .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  19 Oxford English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989).  To \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d something, in other words, is to employ the thing for its instrumental value, <i>i.e., </i>to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13).  A \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, is an inherently intentional act\xe2\x80\x94that is, an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A, p.\xc2\xa015 (1965) (defining intentional acts).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have routinely defined \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d in ways that make clear that the conduct must be intentional.  In <i>Bailey </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (1995)\n, for example, we held that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[use of] a firearm\xe2\x80\x9d required \xe2\x80\x9cactive employment\xe2\x80\x9d of the firearm, such as \xe2\x80\x9cbrandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to fire a firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 143, 148 (emphasis deleted).  We have similarly held that the use of force requires more than \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent or merely accidental conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Leocal </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n9 (2004)\n.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile one may, in theory, actively employ <i>something</i> in an accidental manner, it is much less natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, shooting a gun would be using a firearm in relation to a crime.  <i>Bailey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 148.  Recklessly leaving a loaded gun in one\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, which then discharges after being jostled during the car ride, would not.  The person who placed that gun in the trunk might have acted recklessly or negligently, but he did not actively employ the gun in a crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, especially in a legal context, \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d generally connotes the use of violence against another.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, for example, defines \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999).  Other dictionaries offer similar definitions.  <i>E.g., </i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language 748 (def. 5) (2d ed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d when used in law, means \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property\xe2\x80\x9d); 6 Oxford English Dictionary 34 (def. I(5)(c)) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlawful violence offered to persons or things\xe2\x80\x9d).  And \xe2\x80\x9cviolence,\xe2\x80\x9d when used in a legal context, also implies an intentional act.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1564 (\xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9c[u]njust or unwarranted use of force, usu. accompanied by fury, vehemence, or outrage; physical force unlawfully exercised with the intent to harm\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  When a person talks about \xe2\x80\x9cusing force\xe2\x80\x9d against another, one thinks of intentional acts\xe2\x80\x94punching, kicking, shoving, or using a weapon.  Conversely, one would not naturally call a car acci-dent a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of force,\xe2\x80\x9d even if people were injured by the force of the accident.  As Justice Holmes observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.\xe2\x80\x9d  O. Holmes, The Common Law 3 (1881).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, context confirms that \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d connotes an intentional act.  Section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions also include \xe2\x80\x9cthe threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  In that neighboring prohibition, \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d most naturally means active employment of the weapon.  And it would be odd to say that \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d in that provision refers to active employment (an intentional act) when threatening someone with a weapon, but \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d here is satisfied by merely reckless conduct.  See <i>Sorenson</i> v. <i>Secretary of Treasury</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 851,\n860 (1986)\n (the same words in a statute presumptively have the same meaning).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against a family member refers to intentional acts of violence against a family member.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On this interpretation, Maine\xe2\x80\x99s assault statute likely does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d and thus does not trigger the prohibition on possessing firearms, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  The Maine statute appears to lack, as a required element, the \xe2\x80\x9cuse or attempted use of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Maine\xe2\x80\x99s statute punishes at least some conduct that does not involve the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 207 criminalizes \xe2\x80\x9crecklessly caus[ing] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  By criminalizing all reckless conduct, the Maine statute captures conduct such as recklessly injuring a passenger by texting while driving resulting in a crash.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 charging documents generically recited the statutory language; they did not charge intentional, knowing, and reckless harm as alternative counts.  Accordingly, Maine\xe2\x80\x99s statute appears to treat \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly\xe2\x80\x9d causing bodily injury or an offensive touching as a single, indivisible offense that is satisfied by recklessness.  See <i>Mathis</i> v. <i>United States, ante</i>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  So petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 prior assault convictions do not necessarily have as an element the use of physical force against a family member.  These prior convictions, therefore, do not qualify as a misdemeanor crime involving domestic violence under federal law, and petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions accordingly should be reversed.  At the very least, to the extent there remains uncertainty over whether Maine\xe2\x80\x99s assault statute is divisible, the Court should vacate and remand for the First Circuit to determine that statutory interpretation question in the first instance.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To illustrate where I part ways with the majority, consider different mental states with which a person could create and apply force.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  First, a person can create force intentionally or recklessly.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  For example, a person can intentionally throw a punch or a person can crash his car by driving recklessly.  Second, a person can intentionally or recklessly harm a particular person or object as a result of that force.  For example, a person could throw a punch at a particular person (thereby intentionally applying force to that person) or a person could swing a baseball bat too close to someone (thereby recklessly applying force to that person).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These different mental states give rise to three relevant categories of conduct.  A person might intentionally create force and intentionally apply that force against an object (<i>e.g., </i>punching a punching bag).  A person might also intentionally create force but recklessly apply that force against an object (<i>e.g., </i>practicing a kick in the air, but recklessly hitting a piece of furniture).  Or a person could recklessly create force that results in damage, such as the car crash example.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question before us is what mental state suffices for a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against a family member.  In my view, a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d most naturally refers to cases where a person intentionally creates force and intentionally applies that force against a family member.  It also includes (at least some) cases where a person intentionally creates force but recklessly applies it to a family member.  But I part ways with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that purely reckless conduct\xe2\x80\x94meaning, where a person recklessly creates force\xe2\x80\x94constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my view, it does not, and therefore, the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d is narrower than most state assault statutes, which punish anyone who recklessly causes physical injury.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To identify the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d consider three different types of intentional and reckless force resulting in physical injury.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The paradigmatic case of battery: A person intentionally unleashes force and intends that the force will harm a particular person.  This might include, for example, punching or kicking someone.  Both the majority and I agree that these cases constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This first category includes all cases where a person intentionally creates force and desires or knows with a practical certainty that that force will cause harm.  This is because the law traditionally treats conduct as intended in two circumstances.  First, conduct is intentional when the actor desires to produce a specific result.  1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.2(a), pp. 340\xe2\x80\x93342 (2d ed. 2003).  But conduct is also traditionally deemed inten-tional when a person acts \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d: that is, he knows with practical certainty that a result will follow from his conduct.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A, Comment <i>b</i>, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the actor knows that the consequences are certain, or substantially certain, to result from his act, and still goes ahead, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To illustrate, suppose a person strikes his friend for the purpose of demonstrating a karate move.  The person has no desire to injure his friend, but he knows that the move is so dangerous that he is practically certain his friend will be injured.  Under the common law, the person intended to injure his friend, even though he acted only with knowledge that his friend would be injured rather than the desire to harm him.  Thus, even when a person acts knowingly rather than purposefully, this type of conduct is still a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The second category involves a person who intentionally unleashes force that recklessly causes injury.  The major-ity gives two examples:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">1. The Angry Plate Thrower: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] person throws a plate in anger against the wall near where his wife is standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 6.  The plate shatters, and a shard injures her.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">2. The Door Slammer: \xe2\x80\x9c[A person] slams the door shut with his girlfriend following close behind\xe2\x80\x9d with the effect of \xe2\x80\x9ccatch[ing] her fingers in the jamb.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Angry Plate Thrower and the Door Slammer both intentionally unleashed physical force, but they did not intend to direct that force at those whom they harmed.  Thus, they <i>intentionally</i> employed force, but <i>recklessly</i> caused physical injury with that force.  The majority believes that these cases also constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d and I agree.  The Angry Plate Thrower has used force against the plate, and the Door Slammer has used force against the door.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The more difficult question is whether this \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d comes within \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), which requires that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d be committed by someone having a familial relationship with the victim.  The natural reading of that provision is that the use of physical force must be against a family member.  In some cases, the law readily transfers the intent to use force from the object to the actual victim.  Take the Angry Plate Thrower: If a husband throws a plate at the wall near his wife to scare her, that is assault.  If the plate breaks and cuts her, it becomes a battery, regardless of whether he intended the plate to make contact with her person.  See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owens, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa79, pp. 39\xe2\x80\x9342 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser and Keeton).  Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cif one person intends to harm a second person but instead unintentionally harms a third, the first person\xe2\x80\x99s criminal or tortious intent toward the second applies to the third as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1504 (defining transferred-intent doctrine); see also 1 LaFave, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa75.2(c)(4), at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  Thus, where a person acts in a violent and patently unjustified manner, the law will often impute that the actor intended to cause the injury resulting from his conduct, even if he actually intended to direct his use of force elsewhere.  Because we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law, see <i>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</i> v. <i>Solimino</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104,\n108 (1991)\n, these cases would qualify as the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against a family member.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, and most problematic for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, a person could recklessly unleash force that recklessly causes injury.  Consider two examples: </p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">1. The Text-Messaging Dad: Knowing that he should not be texting and driving, a father sends a text message to his wife.  The distraction causes the father to rear end the car in front of him.  His son, who is a passenger, is injured.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">2. The Reckless Policeman: A police officer speeds to a crime scene without activating his emergency lights and siren and careens into another car in an intersection.  That accident causes the police officer\xe2\x80\x99s car to strike another police officer, who was standing at the intersection.  See <i>Seaton</i> v. <i>State</i>, 385 S. W. 3d 85, 88 (Tex. App. 2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In these cases, both the unleashing of the \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d (the car crash) and the resulting harm (the physical injury) were reckless.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the husband \xe2\x80\x9cuse[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against his son, and the police officer \xe2\x80\x9cuse[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against the other officer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this category is where the majority and I part company.  These examples do not involve the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d under any conventional understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d because they do not involve an active employment of something for a particular purpose.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  In the second category, the actors intentionally use violence against property; this is why the majority can plausibly argue that they have \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d force, even though that force was not intended to harm their family members.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (discussing transferred intent).  But when an individual does not engage in any violence against persons or property\xe2\x80\x94that is, when physical injuries result from purely reckless conduct\xe2\x80\x94there is no \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of physical force.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against a family member includes cases where a person intentionally commits a violent act against a family member.  And the term includes at least some cases where a person engages in a violent act that results in an unintended injury to a family member.  But the term does not include nonviolent, reckless acts that cause physical injury or an offensive touching.  Accordingly, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s definition is overbroad.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In reaching its contrary conclusion, the majority con-fuses various concepts.  First, and as discussed, the majority decides that a person who acts recklessly has used physical force against another.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  But that fails to appreciate the distinction between intentional and reckless conduct.  A \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of physical force requires the intent to cause harm, and the law will impute that intent where the actor knows with a practical certainty that it will cause harm.  But the law will not impute that intent from merely reckless conduct.  Second, and perhaps to rein in its overly broad conception of a use of force, the majority concludes that only \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional\xe2\x80\x9d acts constitute uses of force, <i>ante, </i>at 6, and that mere \xe2\x80\x9caccident[s]\xe2\x80\x9d do not, <i>ante, </i>at 7.  These portions of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis conflate \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional\xe2\x80\x9d conduct with \xe2\x80\x9cintentional\xe2\x80\x9d <i>mens rea </i>and misapprehends the relevant meaning of an \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority blurs the distinction between recklessness and intentional wrongdoing by overlooking the difference between the <i>mens rea</i> for force and the <i>mens rea</i> for causing harm with that force.  The majority says that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 does not demand that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm\xe2\x80\x9d (namely, knowledge), \xe2\x80\x9cas compared with the understanding that it is [a substantial and unjustifiable risk that it will] do so\xe2\x80\x9d (the standard for recklessness).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  Put in the language of <i>mens rea</i>, the majority is saying that purposeful, knowing, and reckless applications of force are all equally \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d of force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the majority fails to explain why mere recklessness in creating force\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to recklessness in causing harm with intentional force\xe2\x80\x94is sufficient.  The majority gives the Angry Plate Thrower and the Door Slammer as examples of reckless conduct that are \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d of physical force, but those examples involve persons who <i>intentionally</i> use force that <i>recklessly</i> causes injuries.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Reckless assault, however, extends well beyond intentional force that recklessly causes injury.  In States where the Model Penal Code has influence, reckless assault includes any recklessly caused physical injury.  See ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7211.1(1)(a) (1980).  This means that the Reckless Policeman and the Text-Messaging Dad are as guilty of assault as the Angry Plate Thrower.  See, <i>e.g., Seaton</i>, 385 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390; see also <i>People </i>v. <i>Grenier</i>, 250 App. Div.\xc2\xa02d 874, 874\xe2\x80\x93875, 672 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 499, 500\xe2\x80\x93501 (1998) (upholding an assault conviction where a drunk driver injured his passengers in a car accident).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s examples are only those in which a person has intentionally used force, meaning that the person acts with purpose or knowledge that force is involved.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  As a result, the majority overlooks the critical distinction between conduct that is intended to cause harm and conduct that is not intended to cause harm.  Violently throwing a plate against a wall is a use of force.  Speeding on a roadway is not.  That reflects the fundamental difference between intentional and reckless wrongdoing.  An intentional wrong is designed to inflict harm.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A, at 15.  A reckless wrong is not: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa7500, Comment <i>f</i>, at 590.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All that remains of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is its unsupported conclusion that recklessness looks enough like knowledge, so that the former suffices for a use of force just as the latter does.  <i>Ante</i>, at 6.  That overlooks a crucial distinction between a \xe2\x80\x9cpractical certainty\xe2\x80\x9d and a substantial risk.  When a person acts with practical certainty, he intentionally produces a result.  As explained above, <i>supra,</i> at 7, when a person acts with knowledge that certain consequences will result, the law imputes to that person the intent to cause those consequences.  And the requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d certainty reflects that, in ordinary life, people rarely have perfect certitude of the facts that they \xe2\x80\x9cknow.\xe2\x80\x9d  But as the probability decreases, \xe2\x80\x9cthe actor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct loses the character of intent, and becomes mere recklessness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A, Comment <i>b</i>, at 15.  And the distinction between intentional and reckless conduct is key for defining \xe2\x80\x9cuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  When a person acts with a practical certainty that he will employ force, he intends to cause harm; he has actively employed force for an instrumental purpose, and that is why we can fairly say he \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d force.  In the case of reckless wrong-doing, however, the injury the actor has caused is just an accidental byproduct of inappropriately risky behavior; he has not actively employed force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d requires the intent to employ the thing being used.  And in law, that intent will be imputed when a person acts with practical certainty that he will actively employ that thing.  Merely disregarding a risk that a harm will result, however, does not supply the requisite intent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To limit its definition of \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority adds two additional requirements.  The conduct must be \xe2\x80\x9cvoli-tional,\xe2\x80\x9d and it cannot be merely \xe2\x80\x9caccident[al].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  These additional requirements will cause confusion, and neither will limit the breadth of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s adopted understanding of a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the majority requires that the use of force must be \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional,\xe2\x80\x9d so that \xe2\x80\x9can involuntary motion, even a powerful one, is not naturally described as an active employment of force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The majority provides two examples:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">1. The Soapy-Handed Husband: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] person with soapy hands loses his grip on a plate, which then shatters and cuts his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 6.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">2. The Chivalrous Door Holder: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] person lets slip a door that he is trying to hold open for his girlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, a husband who loses his grip on a plate or a boyfriend who lets the door slip has not engaged in a volitional act creating force.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The majority distinguishes this \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional\xe2\x80\x9d act requirement from the \xe2\x80\x9cmental state of intention, knowledge, or recklessness with respect to the harmful consequences of his volitional conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Angry Plate Thrower\xe2\x80\x94unlike the Soapy-Handed Husband or Chivalrous Door Holder\xe2\x80\x94has engaged in a volitional act, even if he did not intend to hurl the plate at his wife.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional\xe2\x80\x9d is inconsistent with its traditional legal definition.  The husband who drops a dish on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s foot and the boyfriend who loses his grip while holding the door have acted volitionally.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n \xe2\x80\x98act,\xe2\x80\x99 as that term is ordinarily used, is a voluntary contraction of the muscles, and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d  Prosser and Keeton \xc2\xa78, at 34; see also Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.01 (defining the voluntary act requirement).  For the plate and door examples not to be volitional acts, they would need to be unwilled muscular movements, such as a person who drops the plate because of a seizure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In calling the force in these cases nonvolitional, the majority has confounded the minimum <i>mens rea</i> generally necessary to trigger criminal liability (recklessness) with the requirement that a person perform a volitional act.  Although all involuntary actions are blameless, not all blameless conduct is involuntary.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What the majority means to say is that the men did not <i>intentionally</i> employ force, a requirement materially different from a volitional act.  And this requirement poses a dilemma for the majority.  Recklessly unleashing a force that recklessly causes physical injury\xe2\x80\x94for example, a police officer speeding through the intersection without triggering his lights and siren\xe2\x80\x94is an assault in States that follow the Model Penal Code.  See <i>supra,</i> at 9.  If the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule is to include <i>all</i> reckless assault, then the majority must accept that the Text-Messaging Dad is as guilty of using force against his son as the husband who angrily throws a plate toward his wife\xe2\x80\x94an implausible result.  Alternatively, the majority must acknowledge that its \xe2\x80\x9cvolitional\xe2\x80\x9d act requirement is actually a requirement that the use of force be intentional, even if that intentional act of violence results in a recklessly caused, but unintended, injury.  The majority, of course, refuses to do so because that approach would remove many assault convictions, especially in the many States that have adopted the Model Penal Code, from the sweep of the federal statute.  Thus, the majority is left misapplying basic principles of criminal law to rationalize why all \xe2\x80\x9cassault\xe2\x80\x9d under the Model Penal Code constitutes the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second and relatedly, the majority asserts that a use of force cannot be merely accidental.  But this gloss on what constitutes a use of force provides no further clarity.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9crecklessness\xe2\x80\x9d from an \xe2\x80\x9caccident,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 7, is an equivocation on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  An accident can mean that someone was blameless\xe2\x80\x94for example, a driver who accidentally strikes a deer that darts into a roadway.  But an accident can also refer to the fact that the result was unintended: A car accident is no less an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d just because a driver acted negligently or recklessly.

Congress might have prohibited the possession of firearms by anyone convicted under a state law prohibiting assault or battery.  Congress could also have used language tracking the Model Penal Code by saying that a conviction must have, as an element, \xe2\x80\x9cthe intentional, knowing, or reckless causation of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Congress instead defined a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d by requiring that the offense have \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  And a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d has a well-understood meaning applying only to intentional acts designed to cause harm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even assuming any doubt remains over the reading of \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority errs by reading the statute in a way that creates serious constitutional problems.  The doctrine of constitutional avoidance \xe2\x80\x9ccommand[s] courts, when faced with two plausible constructions of a statute\xe2\x80\x94one constitutional and the other unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94to choose the constitutional reading.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util.

Section 922(g)(9) is already very broad.  It imposes a lifetime ban on gun ownership for a single intentional nonconsensual touching of a family member.  A mother who slaps her 18-year-old son for talking back to her\xe2\x80\x94an intentional use of force\xe2\x80\x94could lose her right to bear arms forever if she is cited by the police under a local ordinance.  The majority seeks to expand that already broad rule to any reckless physical injury or nonconsensual touch.  I would not extend the statute into that constitutionally problematic territory.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The\n \nSecond Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>District of Columbia</i> v. <i>Heller</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570,\n624,\n627,\n635 (2008)\n, the Court held that the Amendment protects the right of all law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms that are in common use for traditionally lawful purposes, including self-defense.  And in <i>McDonald </i>v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742 (2010)\n, the Court held that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right.  See <i>id.,</i> at 767\xe2\x80\x93778; <i>id.,</i> at 806 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The protections enumerated in the\n \nSecond Amendment, no less than those enumerated in the First, are not absolute prohibitions against government regulation.  <i>Heller</i>, 554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 595, 626\xe2\x80\x93627.  Traditionally, States have imposed narrow limitations on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of his right to keep and bear arms, such as prohibiting the carrying of weapons in a concealed manner or in sensitive locations, such as government buildings.  <i>Id.,</i> at 626\xe2\x80\x93627; see, <i>e.g., State </i>v. <i>Kerner</i>, 181 N.\xc2\xa0C. 574, 578\xe2\x80\x93579, 107 S.\xc2\xa0E. 222, 225 (1921).  But these narrow restrictions neither prohibit nor broadly frustrate any individual from gener-ally exercising his right to bear arms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Some laws, however, broadly divest an individual of his\n \nSecond Amendment rights.  <i>Heller</i> approved, in dicta, laws that prohibit dangerous persons, including felons and the mentally ill, from having arms.  554 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 626.  These laws are not narrow restrictions on the right because they prohibit certain individuals from exercising their\n \nSecond Amendment rights at all times and in all places.  To be constitutional, therefore, a law that broadly frustrates an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to keep and bear arms must target individuals who are beyond the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the\n \nSecond Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 922(g)(9) does far more than \xe2\x80\x9cclose [a] dangerous loophole\xe2\x80\x9d by prohibiting individuals who had committed felony domestic violence from possessing guns simply because they pleaded guilty to misdemeanors.  <i>Ante,</i> at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It imposes a lifetime ban on possessing a gun for <i>all</i> nonfelony domestic of-fenses, including so-called infractions or summary offenses.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), 922(g)(9); 27 CFR \xc2\xa7478.11 (2015) (defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to include crimes punishable only by a fine).  These infractions, like traffic tickets, are so minor that individuals do not have a right to trial by jury.  See <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322\n\xe2\x80\x93326 (1996).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today the majority expands \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s sweep into patently unconstitutional territory.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, a single conviction under a state assault statute for recklessly causing an injury to a family member\xe2\x80\x94such as by texting while driving\xe2\x80\x94can now trigger a lifetime ban on gun ownership.  And while it may be true that such incidents are rarely prosecuted, this decision leaves the right to keep and bear arms up to the discretion of federal, state, and local prosecutors.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We treat no other constitutional right so cavalierly.  At oral argument the Government could not identify any other fundamental constitutional right that a person could lose forever by a single conviction for an infraction punishable only by a fine.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\xe2\x80\x9340.  Compare the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Plenty of States still criminalize libel.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Ala. Code. \xc2\xa713A\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x93160 (2015); Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7836.01 (2015); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:47 (West 2016); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 94, \xc2\xa798C (2014); Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7609.765 (2014); N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat.

I have little doubt that the majority would strike down an absolute ban on publishing by a person previously con-victed of misdemeanor libel.  In construing the statute before us expansively so that causing a single minor reckless injury or offensive touching can lead someone to lose his right to bear arms forever, the Court continues to \xe2\x80\x9crelegat[e] the\n \nSecond Amendment to a second-class right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Friedman </i>v. <i>Highland Park</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In enacting \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), Congress was not worried about a husband dropping a plate on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s foot or a parent injuring her child by texting while driving.  Congress was worried that family members were abusing other family members through acts of violence and keeping their guns by pleading down to misdemeanors.  Prohibiting those convicted of intentional and knowing batteries from possessing guns\xe2\x80\x94but not those convicted of reckless batteries\xe2\x80\x94amply carries out Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach, a parent who has a car accident because he sent a text message while driving can lose his right to bear arms forever if his wife or child suffers the slightest injury from the crash.  This is obviously not the correct reading of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  The \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d does not include crimes involving purely reckless conduct.  Because Maine\xe2\x80\x99s statute punishes such conduct, it sweeps more broadly than the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Some of our cases have distinguished \xe2\x80\x9cviolent force\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94force capable of causing physical injury\xe2\x80\x94and common-law force, which included all nonconsensual touching, see <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133\n\xe2\x80\x93141 (2010), but others have not, see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5).
