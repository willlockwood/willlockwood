CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On November 17, 1924, this Court reversed the decree of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing a libel in admiralty against the United States, brought to recover the value of repairs made on the steamship <em>Biran,</em> owned by the United States.  The suit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 267 U. S. 87</a></p><p> was brought under an act authorizing suits against the United States in admiralty, etc., approved March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 Stat. 525.  Nothing was said in the opinion about costs.  The ordinary rule is that costs are not allowed against the United States.  <em>Pine River Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/186/279/case.html">186 U.

S. 272</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/33/150/case.html">United States v.

He relies on \xc2\xa7 3 of the act under which the suit was brought.  That provides that such suits shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties.  A decree against the United States may include costs of suit, and when the decree is for money judgment, interest also at the rate of 4 percent per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall be stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based.  Interest is to run as ordered by the court.  In accordance with this provision, we must assess the costs of this appeal against the United States, and direct the district court to assess also the costs of suit in that court and interest as that court shall order it in accordance with the statute.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
