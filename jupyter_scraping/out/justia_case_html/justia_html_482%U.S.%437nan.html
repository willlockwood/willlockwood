In No. 86-322, respondent J. T. Gibbons, Inc., sued petitioner Crawford Fitting Co. and other petitioners for alleged violations of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 482 U. S. 439</a></p><p> antitrust laws.  The District Court directed a verdict in favor of petitioners. 565 F.Supp. 167 (ED La.1981), <em>aff\'d,</em> 704 F.2d 787 (CA5 1983).  Petitioners then filed a bill of costs with the Clerk of that court, seeking reimbursement from respondent for over $220,000 in litigation expenses, including substantial expert witness fees.  The District Court held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) granted it discretion to exceed the $30-per-day witness fee limit found in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1821(b).  It accordingly awarded petitioners $86,480.70 for their expert witnesses.  102 F.R.D. 73 (ED La.1984).  En banc, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the limit of \xc2\xa7 1821(b) controlled.  790 F.2d 1193 (1986).  In No. 86-328, respondent International Woodworkers of America (IWA) sued petitioner Champion International, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1981.  After a trial on the merits, the District Court dismissed all of respondent\'s claims.  Petitioner thereafter filed a bill of costs, including $11,807 in expert witness fees.  The District Court declined to order respondent to reimburse petitioner for these fees to the extent they exceeded the $30-per-day limit.  The en banc Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, finding the limit set forth in \xc2\xa7 1821(b) dispositive.  790 F.2d 1174 (1986).  We agree, and hold that, when a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses, a federal court is bound by the limit of \xc2\xa7 1821(b), absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p>In 1793, Congress enacted a general provision linking some taxable costs in most cases in federal courts to the practice of the courts of the State in which the federal court sat.  Act of Mar. 1, 1793, \xc2\xa7 4, 1 Stat. 333.  This provision expired in 1799.  Apparently, from 1799 until 1853, federal courts continued to refer to state rules governing taxable costs.  <em>See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html">421 U. S. 240</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#250">421 U. S. 250</a></span> (1975).  By 1853, there was a "great diversity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 482 U. S. 440</a></p><p> in practice among the courts" and "losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#251">421 U. S. 251</a></span>.  Accordingly, Congress returned to the issue and comprehensively regulated fees and the taxation of fees as costs in the federal courts.  The resulting 1853 Fee Act "was a far-reaching Act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts."  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#251">421 U. S. 251</a></span>-252.</p>\n<p>It provided, in part,</p>\n<p>"That in lieu of the compensation now allowed by law to attorneys, solicitors, . . . and . . . witnesses . . . in the several States, the following and no other compensation shall be taxed and allowed."</p>\n<p>Act of Feb. 26, 1853, 10 Stat. 161.  The rate for witnesses was set at $1.50 per day.  10 Stat. 167.  The sweeping reforms of the 1853 Act have been carried forward to today, "without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules."  <em>Alyeska Pipeline, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#255">421 U. S. 255</a></span>.  Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1920 now embodies Congress\' considered choice as to the kinds of expenses that a federal court may tax as costs against the losing party:</p>\n<p>"A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following:"</p>\n<p>"(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;"</p>\n<p>"(2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case;"</p>\n<p>"(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;"</p>\n<p>"(4) Fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case;"</p>\n<p>"(5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;"</p>\n<p>"(6) Compensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title."</p>\n<p>The witness fee specified in \xc2\xa7 1920(3) is defined in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1821: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 482 U. S. 441</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a witness in attendance at any court of the United States . . . shall be paid the fees and allowances provided by this section."</p>\n<p>"(b) A witness shall be paid an attendance fee of $30 per day for each day\'s attendance.  A witness shall also be paid the attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of such attendance or at any time during such attendance."</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), in turn, provides in part:</p>\n<p>"Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs."</p>\n<p>The logical conclusion from the language and interrelation of these provisions is that \xc2\xa7 1821 specifies the amount of the fee that must be tendered to a witness, \xc2\xa7 1920 provides that the fee may be taxed as a cost, and Rule 54(d) provides that the cost shall be taxed against the losing party unless the court otherwise directs.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that, since \xc2\xa7 1920 lists which expenses a court "may" tax as costs, that section only authorizes taxation of certain items.  In their view, \xc2\xa7 1920 does not preclude taxation of costs above and beyond the items listed, and more particularly, amounts in excess of the \xc2\xa7 1821(b) fee.  Thus, the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1920.  We think, however, that no reasonable reading of these provisions together can lead to this conclusion, for petitioners\' view renders \xc2\xa7 1920 superfluous.  If Rule 54(d) grants courts discretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate, then \xc2\xa7 1920, which enumerates the costs that may be taxed, serves no role whatsoever.  We think the better view is that \xc2\xa7 1920 defines the term "costs" as used in Rule 54(d).  Section 1920 enumerates expenses that a federal court may tax as a cost under the discretionary authority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 482 U. S. 442</a></p><p> found in Rule 54(d).  It is phrased permissively because Rule 54(d) generally grants a federal court discretion to refuse to tax costs in favor of the prevailing party.  One of the items enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1920 is the witness fee, set by \xc2\xa7 1821(b) at $30 per day.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept an interpretation of Rule 54(d) that would render any of these specific statutory provisions entirely without meaning.  Repeals by implication are not favored, and petitioners proffer the ultimate in implication, for Rule 54(d) and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 and 1821 are not even inconsistent.  We think that it is clear that, in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 and 1821, Congress comprehensively addressed the taxation of fees for litigants\' witnesses.  This conclusion is all the more compelling when we consider that \xc2\xa7 1920(6) allows the taxation, as a cost, of the compensation of court-appointed expert witnesses.  There is no provision that sets a limit on the compensation for court-appointed expert witnesses in the way that \xc2\xa7 1821(b) sets a limit for litigants\' witnesses.  It is therefore clear that, when Congress meant to set a limit on fees, it knew how to do so.  We think that the inescapable effect of these sections in combination is that a federal court may tax expert witness fees in excess of the $30-per-day limit set out in \xc2\xa7 1821(b) only when the witness is court-appointed.  The discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade this specific congressional command.  Rather, it is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1920.</p>\n<p>The logic of this conclusion notwithstanding, petitioners place heavy weight on a single sentence found in our opinion in <em>Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html">379 U. S. 227</a></span> (1964).  In that case, this Court held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to tax against the losing plaintiff the travel expenses of witnesses for the defendant.  In the course of so ruling, the Court stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he discretion given district judges [by Rule 54(d)] to tax costs should be sparingly exercised with reference to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 482 U. S. 443</a></p><p> expenses not specifically allowed by statute."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#235">379 U. S. 235</a></span>.  Applying this language to the present case, petitioners argue that courts therefore have discretion to tax as costs expenses incurred beyond those specified by Congress as fees in \xc2\xa7 1821, and made taxable by \xc2\xa7 1920.</p>\n<p>The sentence relied upon is classic <em>obiter:</em>  something mentioned in passing, which is not in any way necessary to the decision of the issue before the Court.  We think the dictum is inconsistent with the foregoing analysis, and we disapprove it.</p>\n<p>The argument petitioners present today was squarely rejected in <em>Henkel v. Chicago, S. P., M. &amp; O. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/444/case.html">284 U. S. 444</a></span> (1932).  In that case, the Court held that federal courts have no authority to award expert witness fees in excess of the statutory limit set by Congress in the Fee Act of 1853.  The Court\'s reasoning was straightforward:</p>\n<p>"Specific provision as to the amounts payable and taxable as witness fees was made by Congress as early as the Act of February 28, 1799. . . .  Under these provisions, additional amounts paid as compensation, or fees, to expert witnesses cannot be allowed or taxed as costs in cases in the federal courts."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *   *" </em></p>\n<p>". . .  Congress has dealt with the subject comprehensively, and has made no exception of the fees of expert witnesses.  Its legislation must be deemed controlling. . . . "</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/444/case.html#446">284 U. S. 446</a></span>-447.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that, because <em>Henkel</em> was decided before the merger of law and equity in the federal courts, it is no longer good law.  Petitioners\' argument proceeds along the following lines:  Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, federal courts could sit in law or in equity.  In petitioners\' view, courts sitting in equity had broad discretion to award fees not specified by statute.  <em>Henkel,</em> decided </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 482 U. S. 444</a></p><p> under this regime, held that courts at law had no power to exceed the limits set by statute.  Now that the federal courts\' legal and equitable powers are combined, petitioners conclude that <em>Henkel</em> cannot control the scope of a federal court\'s powers to exceed the limits set by statute.</p>\n<p>We cannot agree.  <em>Henkel</em> rested on statutory interpretation.  Whatever the effect of the merger of law and equity in federal courts, it did not repeal any part of the Fee Act.  Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 and 1821, today\'s counterparts to the provisions of the Fee Act at issue in <em>Henkel,</em> are still law and, when not overridden by contract or explicit statutory authority, they control a federal court\'s power to hold a losing party responsible for the opponent\'s witness fees.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion conforms to our prior interpretations of the 1853 Fee Act.  In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html">421 U. S. 240</a></span> (1975), we considered the general role of the Act in federal courts.  The Act "specified in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#252">421 U. S. 252</a></span>.  The comprehensive scope of the Act and the particularity with which it was drafted demonstrated to us that Congress meant to impose rigid controls on cost-shifting in federal courts.  Thus, we rejected an argument similar to the one posited by petitioners today:</p>\n<p>"Nor has [Congress] extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#260">421 U. S. 260</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although Congress responded to our decision in <em>Alyeska</em> by broadening the availability of attorney\'s fees in the federal courts, <em>see</em> the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988, it has not otherwise "retracted, repealed, or modified the limitations on taxable fees contained in the 1853 statute and its successors."  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#260">421 U.

We think that, as in Alyeska, Congress has made its intent plain in its detailed treatment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 482 U. S. 445</a></p><p> witness fees.  We will not lightly infer that Congress has repealed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or any other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees.

In No. 86-328, even though the District Court found the defendant\'s expert was "helpful and perhaps necessary to its case," the court declined to award fees in excess of the amounts specified in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1821.  Civ. Action No. WC 78-33-WK-P (ND Miss., Aug. 24, 1983), p. 9.</p>\n<p>The Court now informs us that the District Courts had no power to award costs not expressly authorized by statute. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In its haste to extinguish all discretion to award these nonstatutory costs, however, the Court has rendered Rule 54(d) a nullity.</p>\n<p>Before today, it was generally recognized that the "unless the court otherwise directs" language in Rule 54(d) was intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 482 U.

S. 317</a></span>-318 (1920).</p>\n<p>Since the adoption of the Federal Rules, this Court has addressed the scope of the district courts\' power to tax costs on only one occasion.  In <em>Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html">379 U. S. 227</a></span> (1964), the Court held that a District Court acted within its discretion in refusing to tax a witness\' expenses for travel in excess of 100 miles as costs against an unsuccessful plaintiff. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It expressly rejected the argument that a district court lacks the power to award these expenses as costs.  The Court noted:</p>\n<p>"While this Rule could be far more definite as to what \'costs shall be allowed,\' the words \'unless the court otherwise directs\' quite plainly vest some power in the court to allow some \'costs.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#232">379 U. S. 232</a></span>.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 482 U. S. 448</a></p><p> In a sentence labeled dictum by the majority, the Court sought to provide guidance to the lower courts by explaining that this discretion "should be sparingly exercised with reference to expenses not specifically allowed by statute."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#235">379 U. S. 235</a></span>.  As Judge Rubin observed below, "[t]he Court\'s conclusion reveals its premise:  Rule 54(d) gives the district court discretion to award costs not enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1920."  790 F.2d 1174, 1190 (CA5 1986) (en banc) (concurring and dissenting).  This is certainly how Justice Harlan, author of the dissent in <em>Farmer,</em> viewed the case.  <em>See</em> 379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#240">379 U. S. 240</a></span> ("the foundation of today\'s decision" is the "scope of the discretion of a district judge acting within his powers").</p>\n<p>Rather than following <em>Farmer,</em> as it should, the majority relies on <em>Henkel v. Chicago, S. P., M. &amp; O. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/444/case.html">284 U. S. 444</a></span> (1932).  But <em>Henkel</em> provides no support for a restrictive interpretation of a district court\'s power to award fees under Rule 54(d).  The opinion in <em>Henkel</em> addressed the narrow question whether district courts had authority to tax expert witness fees as costs in an action at law.  At the time, courts of law lacked the power to award costs not expressly granted by statute, <em>see Ex parte Peterson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/300/case.html#317">253 U. S. 317</a></span>-318, although those sitting in equity could award such costs, as justice required, without regard to the fee statutes.  Approaching the issue purely as a matter of statutory construction, the Court concluded that expert witness fees were included in and limited to the amounts prescribed by the predecessors to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 and 1821.  284 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/444/case.html#446">284 U. S. 446</a></span>-447.  The majority acknowledges, as it must, that <em>Henkel</em> was decided before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effected a merger of law and equity.  What the majority ignores, however, is the vital significance of that fact.  As noted above, Rule 54(d) adopts the practice in equity, thereby giving federal courts in all actions the broad discretion previously afforded only to courts exercising equitable powers. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 482 U. S. 449</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The majority\'s assertion that discretion can be exercised only "to refuse to tax costs in favor of the prevailing party," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/case.html#442">482 U. S. 442</a></span>, is plainly inconsistent with the equitable principles on which Rule 54(d) is based.  Moreover, it reinforces the fact that the Rule is now entirely superfluous.  Because the language of \xc2\xa7 1920 is permissive -- "[a] judge or clerk of any court of the United States <em>may</em> tax as costs the following" -- courts already have discretion to disallow the costs listed therein. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court noted in <em>Farmer,</em> Rule 54(d) does not define "costs."  379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#232">379 U. S. 232</a></span>.  Seizing on this "omission," the Court now declares that \xc2\xa7 1920 sets forth the universe of "costs" taxable under the Rule.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/case.html#441">482 U. S. 441</a></span>-442.  Any contrary interpretation, it claims, "renders \xc2\xa7 1920 superfluous."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/case.html#441">482 U. S. 441</a></span>.  This misreads \xc2\xa7 1920.  That section does not purport to be exclusive.  It does not direct that "the following costs <em>and no others</em> may be taxed." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  By contrast, the predecessor to \xc2\xa7 1920, the 1853 Fee Act, provided that "the following <em>and no other</em> compensation shall be taxed and allowed," Act of Feb. 26, 1853, 10 Stat. 161 (emphasis added); this language was omitted from the 1948 revision.  Despite this seemingly significant deletion, the majority contends that "[t]he sweeping reforms of the 1853 Act have been carried forward to today, <em>without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/case.html#440">482 U.

In <em>Alyeska,</em> this Court held that the same fee statutes did not </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 482 U. S. 450</a></em></p><p><em> authorize recovery of attorney\'s fees by a prevailing party.  Even in <em>Alyeska,</em> however, the Court recognized that the fee statutes had never been entirely exclusive:\n</em></p>\n<p>"To be sure, the fee statutes have been construed to allow, in limited circumstances, a reasonable attorney\'s fee to the prevailing party in excess of the small sums [for docket fees] permitted by \xc2\xa7 1923."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#257">421 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Not only is the Court\'s holding inconsistent with the language and history of Rule 54(d) and \xc2\xa7 1920, but it is also ill-advised as a policy matter.  As Judge Rubin stated in his opinion below:</p>\n<p>"The costs of litigation, as we all know, have become staggering.  A plaintiff may put a defendant, or a defendant may put a plaintiff, to a tremendous amount of expense, apart from the cost of obtaining an attorney\'s services, in defending or prosecuting a case.  One cause of this expense is the unavoidable necessity of expert witness testimony to establish or rebut many legal claims."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Although the victor in litigation is not entitled to spoils, he ought at least to be able to invoke the court\'s discretion to make him whole."</p>\n<p>790 F.2d at 1192-1193.  For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. 86-328, <em>Champion International Corp. v.

And, as an examination of the record reveals, the issue is not properly before the Court in No. 86-328, either.  In that case, petitioner, a prevailing civil rights defendant, made a motion for attorney\'s fees "and expenses" under \xc2\xa7 1988 and filed a bill of costs under Rule 54(d).  The bill of costs included $31,333.87 for "expert witness fees and expenses."  Record 38.  On December 30, 1982, the District Court summarily denied the motion for attorney\'s fees and expenses, based on its conclusion that, under <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/412/case.html">434 U. S. 412</a></span> (1978), "the lawsuit was brought in good faith, and was neither frivolous, unreasonable, nor without foundation."  Record 1.  The court referred all other questions concerning the taxing of costs to a Magistrate.  <em>Id.</em> at 2.  <em>Petitioner did not appeal the District Court\'s order denying attorney\'s fees under \xc2\xa7 1988.</em>  It appealed only the District Court\'s order of August 24, 1983, denying its application for expert witness fees under Rule 54(d).  <em>See</em> Record 33.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(e), a district court\'s power to compel attendance of witnesses extends only 100 miles.  Relying on this Rule, District Courts had traditionally declined to tax as costs expenses of witnesses traveling more than 100 miles.  <em>See Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> 379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/227/case.html#231">379 U.
