JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On February 12, 1969, respondent filed this civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that, in 1968, Police Officer John R. Carlson of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia arrested him without probable cause and, while he was being held by two other officers, beat him with brass knuckles.  The complaint alleged further that Carlson\'s precinct captain, the chief of police, and the District of Columbia each had negligently failed to train, instruct, supervise, and control Carlson with regard to the circumstances in which an arrest may be made and the extent to which various degrees of force may be used to effect an arrest.  Respondent sought damages against each defendant upon several theories, including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 409 U. S. 419</a></p><p> a common law theory of tort liability and an action for deprivation of civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, which provides: [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the complaint against all defendants without opinion. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the allegations of the complaint were sufficient to state causes of action under both the common law and federal statutory theories of liability.  <em>Carter v. Carlson,</em> 144 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 447 F.2d 358 (1971).  In sustaining respondent\'s claims under \xc2\xa7 1983, the court held that "[a]cts under color of the law of the District of Columbia are under color of the law of a <em>State or Territory\' for the purpose of \xc2\xa7 1983."  <em>Id.</em> at 391 n. 3, 447 F.2d at 361 n. 3.

Thus, it cannot be doubted that the power vested in Congress to enforce this Amendment includes the power to enact laws of nationwide application.</p>\n<p>Moreover, like the Amendment upon which it is based, \xc2\xa7 1982 is not a "mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding" racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property but, rather, an "absolute" bar to all such discrimination, private as well as public, federal as well as state.  <em>Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/case.html#413">392 U. S. 413</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/case.html#437">392 U. S. 437</a></span>.  With this in mind, it would be anomalous indeed if Congress chose to carve out the District of Columbia as the sole exception to an act of otherwise universal application.  And this is all the more true where, as here, the legislative purposes underlying \xc2\xa7 1982 support its applicability in the District.  The dangers of private discrimination, for example, that provided a focal point of Congress\' concern in enacting the legislation, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] were, and are, as present in the District of Columbia as in the States, and the same considerations that led Congress to extend the prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 1982 to the Federal Government apply with equal force to the District, which is a mere instrumentality of that Government.  Thus, in the absence of some express indication of legislative intent to the contrary, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] there was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 409 U. S. 423</a></p><p> ample justification for the holding in <em>Hurd</em> that \xc2\xa7 1982 was intended to outlaw racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property in the District of Columbia as well as elsewhere in the United States.</p>\n<p>The situation is wholly different, however, with respect to \xc2\xa7 1983.  Unlike \xc2\xa7 1982, which derives from the Civil Rights Act of 1866, \xc2\xa7 1983 has its roots in \xc2\xa7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, Act of Apr 20, 1871, \xc2\xa7 1, 17 Stat. 13.  This distinction has great significance, for, unlike the 1866 Act, which was passed as a means to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, the primary purpose of the 1871 Act was "to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment."  17 Stat. 13; <em>see, e.g., Lynch v.

Similarly, actions of the Federal Government and its officers are beyond the purview of the Amendment.  And since the District of Columbia is not a "State" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Bolling v. Sharpe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/497/case.html">347 U.

S. 384</a></span> (1901), neither the District nor its officers are subject to its restrictions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Like the Amendment upon which it based, \xc2\xa7 1983 is of only limited scope.  The statute deals only with those deprivations of rights that are accomplished under the color of the law of "any State or Territory." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  It does not reach purely private conduct and, with the exception of the Territories, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] actions of the Federal Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 409 U. S. 425</a></p><p> and its officers are at least facially exempt from it proscriptions.  Thus, unlike the situation presented in <em>Hurd,</em> the instant case does not involve a constitutional provision and related statute of universal applicability.  This being so, the considerations that led to an expansive reading of \xc2\xa7 1982 so as to include the District of Columbia simply do not apply with respect to \xc2\xa7 1983.  We must therefore examine the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 to determine whether the purposes for which the Act was adopted support a similarly broad construction.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Any analysis of the purposes and scope of \xc2\xa7 1983 must take cognizance of the events and passions of the time at which it was enacted. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  After the Civil War ended in 1865, race relations in the South became increasingly turbulent.  The Ku Klux Klan was organized by southern whites in 1866, and a wave of murders and assaults was launched against both blacks and Union sympathizers. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Thus, at the opening of the 42d Congress, considerable apprehension was expressed by Republicans about the insecurity of life and property in the South, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 409 U. S. 426</a></p><p> and on March 23, 1871, President Grant sent a message to Congress requesting additional federal legislation to curb this rising tide of violence.  Such legislation was deemed essential in light of the inability of the state governments to control the situation. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Five days later, Congressman Shellabarger of Ohio introduced the bill that eventually was to become the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Although there are threads of many thoughts running through the debates on the 1871 Act, it seems clear that \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act, with which we are here concerned, was designed primarily in response to the unwillingness or inability of the state governments to enforce their own laws against those violating the civil rights of others. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Thus, while the Klan itself provided the principal catalyst for the legislation, the remedy created in \xc2\xa7 1 "was not a remedy against [the Klan] or its members but against those who, representing a State in some capacity, were <em>unable</em> or <em>unwilling</em> to enforce a state law."  <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#175">365 U. S. 175</a></span>-176 (emphasis in original).  Senator Pratt of Indiana summarized this concern when he said: [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>"[O]f the hundreds of outrages committed upon loyal people through the agency of this Ku Klux organization, not one has been punished.  This defect in the administration of the laws does not extend to other cases.  Vigorously enough are the laws enforced against Union people.  They only fail in efficiency when a man of known Union sentiments, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 409 U. S. 427</a></p><p> white or black, invokes their aid.  Then Justice closes the door of her temples."</p>\n<p>Similarly, Congressman Hoar of Massachusetts stated: [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>"Now, it is an effectual denial by a State of the equal protection of the laws when any class of officers charged under the laws with their administration permanently and as a rule refuse to extend that protection.  If every sheriff in South Carolina refuses to serve a writ for a colored man and those sheriffs are kept in office year after year by the people of South Carolina, and no verdict against them for their failure of duty can be obtained before a South Carolina jury, the State of South Carolina, through the class of officers who are its representatives to afford the equal protection of the laws to that class of citizens, has denied that protection."</p>\n<p>To the Reconstruction Congress, the need for some form of federal intervention was clear.  It was equally clear, however, that Congress had neither the means nor the authority to exert any direct control, on a day-to-day basis, over the actions of state officials.  The solution chosen was to involve the federal judiciary.  At the time this Act was adopted, it must be remembered, there existed no general federal question jurisdiction in the lower federal courts. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Rather, "Congress relied on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 409 U. S. 428</a></p><p> state courts to vindicate essential rights arising under the Constitution and federal laws." [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html#245">389 U. S. 245</a></span> (1967).  With the growing awareness that this reliance had been misplaced, however, Congress recognized the need for original federal court jurisdiction as a means to provide at least indirect federal control over the unconstitutional actions of state officials. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Congressman Coburn explained: [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>"The United States courts are further above mere local influence than the county courts; their judges can act with more independence, cannot be put under terror, as local judges can; their sympathies are not so nearly identified with those of the vicinage; the jurors are taken from the State, and not the neighborhood; they will be able to rise above prejudices or bad passions or terror more easily. . . .  We believe that we can trust our United States courts, and we propose to do so."</p>\n<p>Thus, in the final analysis, \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act may be viewed as an effort</p>\n<p>"to afford a federal right in federal courts because, by reason of prejudice, passion, neglect, intolerance or otherwise, state laws might not be enforced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 409 U. S. 429</a></p><p> and the claims of citizens to the enjoyment of rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment might be denied by the state agencies."</p>\n<p><em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#180">365 U. S. 180</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There was no need, however, to create federal court jurisdiction for the District of Columbia.  Even prior to 1871, the courts of the District possessed general jurisdiction over both federal and local matters.  Act of Mar. 3, 1863, c. 91, 12 Stat. 762.  Thus, the jurisdictional aspects of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act were entirely superfluous with respect to the District.  Moreover, while Congress was unable to exert any direct control over the actions of state officials, it was authorized under Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 17, of the Constitution to exercise plenary power over the District of Columbia and its officers.

Thus, although the Constitution vested control over the Territories in the Congress, its practical control was both "confused and ineffective," [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] making the problem of enforcement of civil rights in the Territories more similar to the problem as it existed in the States than in the District of Columbia. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the effort to analogize the District of Columbia to the Territories in this context faces strong theoretical obstacles.
