State prosecutors then dismissed their charges to allow federal authorities to prosecute him.  When Cheever filed notice that he intended to introduce expert evidence that methamphetamine intoxication negated his ability to form specific intent, the Federal District Court ordered Cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.  The federal case was eventually dismissed without prejudice.  Meanwhile, this Court held the State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty scheme constitutional, see Kansas v. Marsh, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163\n.  The State then brought a second prosecution.  At trial, Cheever raised a voluntary intoxication defense, offering expert testimony regarding his methamphetamine use.  In rebuttal, the State sought to present testimony from the expert who had examined Cheever by the Federal District Court order.  Defense counsel objected, arguing that since Cheever had not agreed to the examination, introduction of the testimony would violate the \n \nFifth Amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself.  The trial court allowed the testimony, and the jury found Cheever guilty and voted to impose a death sentence.  The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the conviction and sentence, relying on Estelle v. Smith, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 454\n, in which this Court held that a court-ordered psychiatric examination violated a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFifth Amendment rights when the defendant neither initiated the examination nor put his mental capacity in dispute.  The court distinguished the holding of Buchanan v. Kentucky, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 402\n, that a State may introduce the results of such an examination for the limited purpose of rebutting a mental-status defense, on the basis that voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect under Kansas law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The rule of Buchanan, reaffirmed here, applies in this case to permit the prosecution to offer the rebuttal evidence at issue.

This Court concluded that this rebuttal testimony did not offend the \n \nFifth Amendment, holding that when a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense, the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.  Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was not limited to the circumstance that the evaluation was requested jointly by the defense and the government.  Nor did the case turn on whether state law referred to extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense.

See Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n\n178 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304\n.  Here, the prosecution elicited testimony from its expert only after Cheever offered expert testimony about his inability to form the requisite mens rea.  Excluding this testimony would have undermined Buchanan and the core truth-seeking function of trial.

Mental-status defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mens rea, mental capacity to commit the crime, or ability to premeditate.  To the extent that the Kansas Supreme Court declined to apply Buchanan because Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s intoxication was \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed, as evidenced by the fact that the courts where Buchanan was tried treated his extreme emotional disturbance as a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary\xe2\x80\x9d condition.

We hold that it does not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the morning of January 19, 2005, Scott Cheever shot and killed Matthew Samuels, a sheriff of Greenwood County, Kansas, and shot at other local law enforcement officers.  In the hours before the shooting, Cheever and his friends had cooked and smoked methamphetamine at a home near Hilltop, Kansas.  Samuels and multiple deputies drove there to arrest Cheever on an unrelated outstanding warrant.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen one of Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s friends warned him that officers were en route, Cheever rushed outside and tried to drive away, but his car had a flat tire.  He returned inside and hid with a friend in an upstairs bedroom, holding a loaded .44 caliber revolver.  Cheever then heard footsteps on the stairs leading up to the room, and he stepped out and shot Samuels, who was climbing the stairs.  After briefly returning to the bedroom, Cheever walked back to the staircase and shot Samuels again.  He also shot at a deputy and a detective, as well as members of a local SWAT (special weapons and tactics) team that had since arrived.  Only Samuels was hit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State charged Cheever with capital murder.  But shortly thereafter, in an unrelated case, the Kansas Supreme Court found the State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty scheme unconstitutional.  State v. Marsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d 445 (2004).  Rather than continuing to prosecute Cheever without any chance of a death sentence, state prosecutors dismissed their charges and allowed federal authorities to prosecute Cheever under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73591 et\xc2\xa0seq.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the federal case, Cheever filed notice that he \xe2\x80\x9cintend[ed] to introduce expert evidence relating to his intoxication by methamphetamine at the time of the events on January 19, 2005, which negated his ability to form spe-cific intent, e.g., malice aforethought, premeditation and deliberation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 69\xe2\x80\x9370.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2(b), the District Court ordered Cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation by Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist, to assess how methamphetamine use had affected him when he shot Samuels.  Welner interviewed Cheever for roughly five and a half hours.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal case proceeded to trial.  Seven days into jury selection, however, defense counsel became unable to continue; the court suspended the proceedings and later dismissed the case without prejudice.  Meanwhile, this Court had reversed the Kansas Supreme Court and held that the Kansas death penalty statute was constitutional.  Kansas v. Marsh, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163, \n167 (2006)\n.  A second federal prosecution never commenced.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKansas then brought a second state prosecution.  At the state trial, Cheever presented a voluntary-intoxication defense, arguing that his methamphetamine use had ren-dered him incapable of premeditation.  In support of this argument, Cheever offered testimony from Roswell Lee Evans, a specialist in psychiatric pharmacy and dean of the Auburn University School of Pharmacy.  Evans opined that Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s long-term methamphetamine use had damaged his brain.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Evans also testified that on the morning of the shooting, Cheever was acutely intoxicated.  According to Evans, Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s actions were \xe2\x80\x9cvery much influenced by\xe2\x80\x9d his use of methamphetamine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the defense rested, the State sought to present rebuttal testimony from Welner, the expert who had examined Cheever by order of the federal court.  Defense counsel objected, arguing that because Welner\xe2\x80\x99s opinions were based in part on an examination to which Cheever had not voluntarily agreed, his testimony would violate the \n \nFifth Amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself.  The State countered that the testimony was necessary to rebut Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary-intoxication defense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court agreed with the State.  The court was persuaded, in part, by the fact that the defense expert had himself relied on Welner\xe2\x80\x99s examination report: \xe2\x80\x9cI think that fact alone probably allows the State to call [Welner] to give his own point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 92.  The court allowed Welner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony for the purpose of showing that Cheever shot Samuels \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of his antisocial personal-ity, not because his brain was impaired by methamphetamine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 94.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe jury found Cheever guilty of murder and attempted murder.  At the penalty phase, it unanimously voted to impose a sentence of death, and the trial court accepted that verdict.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court, Cheever argued that the State had violated his \n \nFifth Amendment rights when it introduced, through Welner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, statements that he had made during the federal court-ordered mental examination.  The court agreed, relying primarily on Estelle v. Smith, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 454 (1981)\n, in which we held that a court-ordered psychiatric exami-nation violated the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFifth Amendment rights when the defendant neither initiated the examination nor put his mental capacity in dispute at trial.  295 Kan. 229, 243\xe2\x80\x93244, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d 1007, 1019\xe2\x80\x931020 (2012) (per curiam).  The court acknowledged, id., at 244\xe2\x80\x93245, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1020, our holding that a State may introduce the results of a court-ordered mental examination for the limited purpose of rebutting a mental-status defense.  Buchanan v. Kentucky, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 402\n\xe2\x80\x93424 (1987).  But it distinguished Buchanan on the basis that under Kansas law, voluntary intoxication is not a \xe2\x80\x9cmental disease or defect.\xe2\x80\x9d  295 Kan., at 250, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1023.  Consequently, it vacated Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence, holding that Cheever had not waived his \n \nFifth Amendment privilege and that his federal court-ordered examination should not have been used against him at the state-court trial.  Ibid.  We granted certiorari, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), and now reverse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFifth Amendment guarantees that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. .\xe2\x80\x9d  We held in Estelle that under the \n \nFifth Amendment, when a criminal defendant \xe2\x80\x9cneither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d his compelled statements to a psychiatrist cannot be used against him.  451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 468.  In that case, a judge ordered a psychiatric exam-ination to determine the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s competency to stand trial.  Id., at 456\xe2\x80\x93457.  The prosecution then used statements from that examination during the sentencing phase of the trial as evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness.  Id., at 458\xe2\x80\x93460.  Emphasizing that the defendant had neither \xe2\x80\x9cintroduced\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cpsychiatric evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d nor even \xe2\x80\x9cindicated that he might do so,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 466, we concluded that the \n \nFifth Amendment did not permit the State to use the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statements in this manner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Buchanan, we addressed the admissibility of evidence from a court-ordered evaluation where\xe2\x80\x94unlike in Estelle\xe2\x80\x94a defendant had introduced psychiatric evidence related to his mental-status defense.  We held that the \n \nFifth Amendment allowed the prosecution to present evidence from the evaluation to rebut the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.  And while, as Cheever notes, the mental evaluation in Buchanan was requested jointly by the defense and the government, our holding was not limited to that circumstance.  Moreover, contrary to Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the case did not turn on whether state law referred to extreme emotional disturbance as an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buchanan, 483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 408, 422 (holding that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of rebuttal expert testimony is permissible where a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpresents psychiatric evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rule of Buchanan, which we reaffirm today, is that where a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense, the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.  Ibid.  Any other rule would undermine the adversarial process, allowing a defendant to provide the jury, through an expert operating as proxy, with a one-sided and potentially inaccurate view of his mental state at the time of the alleged crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe admission of this rebuttal testimony harmonizes with the principle that when a defendant chooses to testify in a criminal case, the \n \nFifth Amendment does not allow him to refuse to answer related questions on cross-examination.  A defendant \xe2\x80\x9chas no right to set forth to the jury all the facts which tend in his favor without laying himself open to a cross-examination upon those facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n\n178 U. S. 304, \n315 (1900)\n.  We explained in Brown v. United States, \n\n356 U. S. 148 (1958)\n, which involved a witness\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to answer questions in a civil case, that where a party provides testimony and then refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he interests of the other party and regard for the function of courts of justice to ascertain the truth become relevant, and prevail in the balance of considerations determining the scope and limits of the privilege against self-incrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 156.  When a defendant presents evidence through a psychological expert who has examined him, the government likewise is permitted to use the only effective means of challenging that evidence: testimony from an expert who has also examined him.  See United States v. Byers, 740 F.\xc2\xa02d 1104, 1113 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (holding that the Government could present rebuttal expert testimony in part because it is perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cthe most trustworthy means of attempting to meet\xe2\x80\x9d the burden of proof (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe prosecution here elicited testimony from its expert only after Cheever offered expert testimony about his in-ability to form the requisite mens rea.  The testimony of the government expert rebutted that of Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s expert.  See id. at 1114 (\xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily the only effective rebuttal of psychiatric opinion testimony is contradictory opinion tes-timony; and for that purpose .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the basic tool of psy-chiatric study remains the personal interview, which requires rapport between the interviewer and the subject\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); State v.

Id., at 250, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1023\xe2\x80\x931024 (citing State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 139 (2001)).  The court therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCheever did not waive his \n \nFifth Amendment privilege and thus permit his court-ordered examination by Dr. Welner to be used against him at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  295 Kan., at 251, 284 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1024.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis reasoning misconstrues our precedents.  Although Kansas law defines \xe2\x80\x9cmental disease or defect\xe2\x80\x9d narrowly, to exclude voluntary intoxication, that phrase is actually not the salient one under our precedents.  In Buchanan, we permitted rebuttal testimony where the defendant presented evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mental status\xe2\x80\x99 defense of extreme emotional disturbance.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 423.  And \xe2\x80\x9cmental status\xe2\x80\x9d is a broader term than \xe2\x80\x9cmental disease or defect,\xe2\x80\x9d at least to the extent that Kansas law excludes voluntary intoxication from that definition.  Mental-status defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mens rea, mental capacity to commit the crime, or ability to premeditate.  Defendants need not as-sert a \xe2\x80\x9cmental disease or defect\xe2\x80\x9d in order to assert a defense based on \xe2\x80\x9cmental status.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo the extent that the Kansas Supreme Court declined to apply Buchanan because Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s intoxication was \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary,\xe2\x80\x9d our precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed.  Like voluntary intoxication, extreme emotional disturbance is a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary\xe2\x80\x9d condition, at least according to the Kentucky state courts where Buchanan was tried.  See McClellan v. Commonwealth, 715 S. W. 2d 464, 468\xe2\x80\x93469 (Ky. 1986) (defining extreme emotional disturbance as \xe2\x80\x9ca temporary state of mind so enraged, inflamed, or disturbed as to overcome one\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and to cause one to act uncontrollably from [an] impelling force of [an] extreme emotional disturbance rather than from evil or malicious purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  We nonetheless held in Buchanan that the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, when supported by expert testimony, may be re-butted with expert testimony.  The same is true here.  Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatric evidence concerned his mental status because he used it to argue that he lacked the requisite mental capacity to premeditate.  The \n \nFifth Amendment therefore did not bar the State from using Welner\xe2\x80\x99s examination to rebut Cheever\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary-intoxication defense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCheever further contends that the \n \nFifth Amendment imposes limits on the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce rebuttal evidence regarding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental status.

In Buchanan, for example, although the prosecution had used a psychiatric report to rebut the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of extreme emotional disturbance, we noted that the trial court had redacted the report so as to avoid exposing the jury to \xe2\x80\x9cthe very different issue\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s competency to stand trial.  Id., at 423, n.\xc2\xa020.  Two years later, we explained in dictum that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing\xe2\x80\x9d in our precedents \xe2\x80\x9csuggests that a defendant opens the door to the admission of psychiatric evidence on future dangerousness by raising an insanity defense at the guilt stage of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Powell v. Texas, \n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680\n\xe2\x80\x93686, n. 3 (1989) (\xc2\xa0per curiam).  Here, however, the Kansas Supreme Court did not address whether Welner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony exceeded the scope of rebuttal testimony permitted by the \n \nFifth Amendment or by the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary rules.
