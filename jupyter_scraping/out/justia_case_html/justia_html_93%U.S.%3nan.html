JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The decision made by this Court in <em>Hot Springs Cases</em> at the last term, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/698/case.html">92 U. S. 698</a></span>, has disposed of the principal controversy between the parties in this case by declaring that neither of them is entitled to the land in question, and that the same belongs to the United States.  As the decree of the Supreme Court of Arkansas in the present case does not contravene this decision, but refuses aid to any of the parties against each other except as to the improvements erected by each respectively, and as to these saves the rights of the United States, we do not perceive any error in said decree on any federal question.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
