JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Three complainants, claiming to represent themselves and others like situated (numbering altogether 550), instituted this proceeding in equity against Hennepin county, Minnesota, and certain of its officers, in the district court of the United States, seeking an injunction to prevent collection of a tax under $40 assessed against each of them, for the year 1913, on account of his membership in the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="622">Page 239 U.

The district court sustained this objection upon authority of <em>Wheless v. St. Louis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/180/379/case.html">180 U.
