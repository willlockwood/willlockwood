Under the statute, property that has outlived its usefulness to the Government is declared "surplus" and may be transferred to private or other public entities.  The Act authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the Secretary of Education) to assume responsibility for disposing of surplus real property for educational use, and he may sell such property to nonprofit, tax-exempt educational institutions for consideration that takes into account any benefit which has accrued or may accrue to the United States from the transferee\'s use of the property.  Property formerly used as a military hospital was declared to be "surplus property" under the Act and was conveyed by the Department of HEW to petitioner church-related college.  The appraised value of the property, $577,500, was discounted by the Secretary of HEW\'s computation of a 100% public benefit allowance, thus permitting petitioner to acquire the property without making any financial payment.  Respondents, an organization dedicated to the separation of church and State and several of its employees, brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the conveyance on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and alleging that each member of respondent organization "would be deprived of the fair and constitutional use of his (her) tax dollars."

Property belonging to the United States."  Shortly after the termination of hostilities in the Second World War, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 377, as amended, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 471 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III).  The Act was designed, in part, to provide "an economical and efficient system for . . . the disposal of surplus property."  63 Stat. 378, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 471.  In furtherance of this policy, federal agencies are directed to maintain adequate inventories of the property under their control and to identify excess property for transfer to other agencies able to use it.  <em>See</em> 63 Stat. 384, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 483(b), (c). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Property that has outlived its usefulness to the Federal Government is declared "surplus," [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and may be transferred to private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 454 U. S. 467</a></p><p> or other public entities.  <em>See generally</em> 63 Stat. 385, as amended, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484.</p>\n<p>The Act authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Secretary of Education [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]) to assume responsibility for disposing of surplus real property "for school, classroom, or other educational use."  63 Stat. 387, as amended, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484(k)(1).  Subject to the disapproval of the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary may sell or lease the property to nonprofit, tax-exempt educational institutions for consideration that takes into account "any benefit which has accrued or may accrue to the United States" from the transferee\'s use of the property.  63 Stat. 387, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 484(k)(1)(A), (C). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  By regulation, the Secretary has provided for the computation of a "public benefit allowance," which discounts the transfer price of the property "on the basis of benefits to the United States from the use of such property for educational purposes."  34 CFR \xc2\xa7 12.9(a) (1980). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The property which spawned this litigation was acquired by the Department of the Army in 1942, as part of a larger tract of approximately 181 acres of land northwest of Philadelphia.  The Army built on that land the Valley Forge General Hospital, and for 30 years thereafter, that hospital provided medical care for members of the Armed Forces.  In April, 1973, as part of a plan to reduce the number of military </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 454 U. S. 468</a></p><p> installations in the United States, the Secretary of Defense proposed to close the hospital, and the General Services Administration declared it to be "surplus property."</p>\n<p>The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) eventually assumed responsibility for disposing of portions of the property, and in August, 1976, it conveyed a 77-acre tract to petitioner, the Valley Forge Christian College. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The appraised value of the property at the time of conveyance was $577,500. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This appraised value was discounted, however, by the Secretary\'s computation of a 100% public benefit allowance, which permitted petitioner to acquire the property without making any financial payment for it.  The deed from HEW conveyed the land in fee simple with certain conditions subsequent, which required petitioner to use the property for 30 years solely for the educational purposes described in petitioner\'s application.  In that description, petitioner stated its intention to conduct</p>\n<p>"a program of education . . . meeting the accrediting standards of the State of Pennsylvania, The American Association of Bible Colleges, the Division of Education of the General Council of the Assemblies of God and the Veterans Administration."</p>\n<p>Petitioner is a nonprofit educational institution operating under the supervision of a religious order known as the Assemblies of God.  By its own description, petitioner\'s purpose is "to offer systematic training on the collegiate level to men and women for Christian service as either ministers or laymen."  App. 34.  Its degree programs reflect this orientation by providing courses of study "to train leaders for church related ministries."  <em>Id.</em> at 102.  Faculty members </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 454 U. S. 469</a></p><p> must "have been baptized in the Holy Spirit and be living consistent Christian lives,"  <em>id.</em> at 37, and all members of the college administration must be affiliated with the Assemblies of God, <em>id.</em> at 36.  In its application for the 77-acre tract, petitioner represented that, if it obtained the property, it would make "additions to its offerings in the arts and humanities," and would strengthen its "psychology" and "counseling" courses to provide services in inner-city areas.</p>\n<p>In September, 1976, respondents Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc. (Americans United), and four of its employees, learned of the conveyance through a news release.  Two months later, they brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, later transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to challenge the conveyance on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>See id.</em> at 10.  In its amended complaint, Americans United described itself as a nonprofit organization composed of 90,000 "taxpayer members."  The complaint asserted that each member</p>\n<p>"would be deprived of the fair and constitutional use of his (her) tax dollar for constitutional purposes in violation of his (her) rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Respondents sought a declaration that the conveyance was null and void, and an order compelling petitioner to transfer the property back to the United States.  <em>Id.</em> at 12.</p>\n<p>On petitioner\'s motion, the District Court granted summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A42.  The court found that respondents lacked standing to sue as taxpayers under <em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span> (1968), and had "failed to allege that they have suffered any actual or concrete injury beyond a generalized grievance common to all taxpayers."  App. to Pet. for Cert. A43. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 454 U. S. 470</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed the judgment of the District Court by a divided vote.  <em>Americans United v. U.S. Dept. of HEW,</em> 619 F.2d 252 (1980).  All members of the court agreed that respondents lacked standing as taxpayers to challenge the conveyance under <em>Flast v. Cohen, supra,</em> since that case extended standing to taxpayers <em>qua</em> taxpayers only to challenge congressional exercises of the power to tax and spend conferred by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution, and this conveyance was authorized by legislation enacted under the authority of the Property Clause, Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 3, cl. 2.  Notwithstanding this significant factual difference from <em>Flast,</em> the majority of the Court of Appeals found that respondents had standing merely as "citizens," claiming "<em>injury in fact\' to their shared individuated right to a government that `shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.\'"  619 F.2d at 261.  In the majority\'s view, this "citizen standing" was sufficient to satisfy the "case or controversy" requirement of Art. III.  One judge, perhaps sensing the doctrinal difficulties with the majority\'s extension of standing, wrote separately, expressing his view that standing was necessary to satisfy "the need for an available plaintiff," without whom "the Establishment Clause would be rendered virtually unenforceable" by the judiciary.  <em>Id.</em> at 267, 268.  The dissenting judge expressed the view that respondents\' allegations constituted a "generalized grievance . . . too abstract to satisfy the injury in fact component of standing."  <em>Id.</em> at 269.  He therefore concluded that their standing to contest the transfer was barred by this Court\'s decisions in <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html">418 U. S. 208</a></span> (1974), and <em>United States v.

S. 166</a></span> (1974).  619 F.2d at 270-271.\n</em></p>\n<p>Because of the unusually broad and novel view of standing to litigate a substantive question in the federal courts adopted by the Court of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 450 U.S. 909 (1981), and we now reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 454 U. S. 471</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution limits the "judicial power" of the United States to the resolution of "cases" and "controversies."  The constitutional power of federal courts cannot be defined, and indeed has no substance, without reference to the necessity "to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies."  <em>Liverpool S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/113/33/case.html">113 U. S. 33</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/113/33/case.html#39">113 U. S. 39</a></span> (1885).  The requirements of Art. III are not satisfied merely because a party requests a court of the United States to declare its legal rights, and has couched that request for forms of relief historically associated with courts of law in terms that have a familiar ring to those trained in the legal process.  The judicial power of the United States defined by Art. III is not an unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative or executive acts.  The power to declare the rights of individuals and to measure the authority of governments, this Court said 90 years ago, "is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy."  <em>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html">143 U. S. 339</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html#345">143 U. S. 345</a></span> (1892).  Otherwise, the power "is not judicial . . . in the sense in which judicial power is granted by the Constitution to the courts of the United States."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/54/40/case.html">United States v. Ferreira,</a></span></em> 13 How. 40,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/54/40/case.html#48">54 U. S. 48</a></span> (1852).</p>\n<p>As an incident to the elaboration of this bedrock requirement, this Court has always required that a litigant have "standing" to challenge the action sought to be adjudicated in the lawsuit.  The term "standing" subsumes a blend of constitutional requirements and prudential considerations, <em>see Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#498">422 U. S. 498</a></span> (1975), and it has not always been clear in the opinions of this Court whether particular features of the "standing" requirement have been required by Art. III <em>ex proprio vigore,</em> or whether they are requirements that the Court itself has erected and which were not compelled by the language of the Constitution.  <em>See Flast v. Cohen, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#97">392 U. S. 97</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 454 U. S. 472</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A recent line of decisions, however, has resolved that ambiguity, at least to the following extent:  at an irreducible minimum, Art. III requires the party who invokes the court\'s authority to "show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant," <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/case.html">441 U. S. 91</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/case.html#99">441 U. S. 99</a></span> (1979), and that the injury "fairly can be traced to the challenged action" and "is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision," <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U. S. 26</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#38">426 U.

III limit the federal judicial power</p>\n<p>"to those disputes which confine federal courts to a role consistent with a system of separated powers and which are traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process."</p>\n<p><em>Flast v. Cohen,</em> 392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#97">392 U. S. 97</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The requirement of "actual injury redressable by the court," <em>Simon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#39">426 U. S. 39</a></span>, serves several of the "implicit policies embodied in Article III," <em>Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#96">392 U. S. 96</a></span>.  It tends to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.  The "standing" requirement serves other purposes.  Because it assures an actual factual setting in which the litigant asserts a claim of injury in fact, a court may decide the case with some confidence that its decision will not pave the way for lawsuits which have some, but not all, of the facts of the case actually decided by the court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 454 U. S. 473</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Art. III aspect of standing also reflects a due regard for the autonomy of those persons likely to be most directly affected by a judicial order.  The federal courts have abjured appeals to their authority which would convert the judicial process into "no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders."  <em>United States v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html">412 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#687">412 U. S. 687</a></span> (1973).  Were the federal courts merely publicly funded forums for the ventilation of public grievances or the refinement of jurisprudential understanding, the concept of "standing" would be quite unnecessary.  But the "cases and controversies" language of Art. III forecloses the conversion of courts of the United States into judicial versions of college debating forums.  As we said in <em>Sierra Club v. Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html">405 U. S. 727</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html#740">405 U. S. 740</a></span> (1972):</p>\n<p>"The requirement that a party seeking review must allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected . . . does serve as at least a rough attempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome."</p>\n<p>The exercise of judicial power, which can so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends, is therefore restricted to litigants who can show "injury in fact" resulting from the action which they seek to have the court adjudicate.</p>\n<p>The exercise of the judicial power also affects relationships between the coequal arms of the National Government.  The effect is, of course, most vivid when a federal court declares unconstitutional an act of the Legislative or Executive Branch.  While the exercise of that "ultimate and supreme function," <em>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html#345">143 U. S. 345</a></span>, is a formidable means of vindicating individual rights, when employed unwisely or unnecessarily, it is also the ultimate threat to the continued effectiveness of the federal courts in performing that role.

Proper regard for the complex nature of our constitutional structure requires neither that the Judicial Branch shrink from a confrontation with the other two coequal branches of the Federal Government nor that it hospitably accept for adjudication claims of constitutional violation by other branches of government where the claimant has not suffered cognizable injury.  Thus, this Court has</p>\n<p>"refrain[ed] from passing upon the constitutionality of an act [of the representative branches] unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it."</p>\n<p><em>Blair v.

Satisfaction of the former cannot substitute for a demonstration of "<em>distinct and palpable injury\' . . . that is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted."  <em>Gladstone, Realtors v.

But of one thing we may be sure:  those who do not possess Art. III standing may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 454 U.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Article III, which is every bit as important in its circumscription of the judicial power of the United States as in its granting of that power, is not merely a troublesome hurdle to be overcome, if possible, so as to reach the "merits" of a lawsuit which a party desires to have adjudicated; it is a part of the basic charter promulgated by the Framers of the Constitution at Philadelphia in 1787, a charter which created a general government, provided for the interaction between that government and the governments of the several States, and was later amended so as to either enhance or limit its authority with respect to both States and individuals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The injury alleged by respondents in their amended complaint is the "depriv[ation] of the fair and constitutional use of [their] tax dollar."

In that action, a taxpayer brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921, which provided federal funding to the States for the purpose of improving maternal and infant health.  The injury she alleged consisted of the burden of taxation in support of an unconstitutional regime, which she characterized as a deprivation of property without due process.  "Looking through forms of words to the substance of [the] complaint," the Court concluded that the only "injury" was the fact "that officials of the executive department of the government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be unconstitutional."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#488">262 U.

S. 487</a></span>.  In rejecting this as a cognizable injury sufficient to establish standing, the Court admonished:</p>\n<p>"The party who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally. . . .

S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Following the decision in <em>Frothingham,</em> the Court confirmed that the expenditure of public funds in an allegedly unconstitutional manner is not an injury sufficient to confer standing, even though the plaintiff contributes to the public coffers as a taxpayer.  In <em>Doremus v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/case.html">342 U. S. 429</a></span> (1952), plaintiffs brought suit as citizens and taxpayers, claiming that a New Jersey law which authorized public school teachers in the classroom to read passages from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 454 U. S. 478</a></p><p> the Bible violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Court dismissed the appeal for lack of standing:</p>\n<p>"This Court has held that the interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect to furnish a basis for an appeal to the preventive powers of the Court over their manner of expenditure. . . .  Without disparaging the availability of the remedy by taxpayer\'s action to restrain unconstitutional acts which result in direct pecuniary injury, we reiterate what the Court said of a federal statute as equally true when a state Act is assailed:"</p>\n<p>"The party who invokes the power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/case.html#433">342 U.

In short, the Court found that plaintiffs\' grievance was "not a direct dollars-and-cents injury, but is a religious difference."  342 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/case.html#434">342 U.

Cohen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html">392 U. S. 83</a></span> (1968).  The taxpayer plaintiffs in <em>Flast</em> sought to enjoin the expenditure of federal funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which they alleged were being used to support religious schools in violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Court developed a two-part test to determine whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue.  First, because a taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue of his liability for taxes, the Court held that</p>\n<p>"a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 454 U.

Second, the Court required the taxpayer to</p>\n<p>"show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations upon the exercise of the taxing and spending power, and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U.

I, \xc2\xa7 8, to spend for the general welfare," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#103">392 U. S. 103</a></span>, and because the Establishment Clause, on which plaintiffs\' complaint rested, "operates as a specific constitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power conferred by Art.

S. 105</a></span>.  Thus, the Court reaffirmed that the "case or controversy" aspect of standing is unsatisfied</p>\n<p>"where a taxpayer seeks to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#106">392 U.

First, the source of their complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW to transfer a parcel of federal property. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  <em>Flast</em> limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed "only [at] exercises of congressional power."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U.

S. 217</a></span>, the Court of Appeals relied on factual differences which we do not think amount to legal distinctions.  The court decided that respondents\' claim differed from those in <em>Schlesinger</em> and <em>Richardson,</em> which were predicated, respectively, on the Incompatibility and Accounts Clauses, because</p>\n<p>"it is, at the very least, arguable that the Establishment Clause creates in each citizen a \'personal constitutional right\' to a government that does not establish religion."</p>\n<p>619 F.2d at 265 (footnote omitted).  The court found it unnecessary to determine whether this "arguable" proposition was correct, since it judged the mere allegation of a legal right sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p>This reasoning process merely disguises, we think with a rather thin veil, the inconsistency of the court\'s results with our decisions in <em>Schlesinger</em> and <em>Richardson.</em>  The plaintiffs in those cases plainly asserted a "personal right" to have the Government act in accordance with their views of the Constitution; indeed, we see no barrier to the <em>assertion</em> of such claims with respect to any constitutional provision.  But assertion of a right to a particular kind of Government conduct, which the Government has violated by acting differently, cannot alone satisfy the requirements of Art. III without draining those requirements of meaning. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 454 U.

Each establishes a norm of conduct which the Federal Government is bound to honor -- to no greater or lesser extent than any other inscribed in the Constitution.  To the extent the Court of Appeals relied on a view of standing under which the Art. III burdens diminish as the "importance" of the claim on the merits increases, we reject that notion.  The requirement of standing "focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court, and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated."  <em>Flast v.

They fail to identify any personal injury suffered by them <em>as a consequence</em> of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees.  That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III, even though the disagreement is phrased in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 454 U.

It is evident that respondents are firmly committed to the constitutional principle of separation of church and State, but standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant\'s interest or the fervor of his advocacy.  "[T]hat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues," <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> 369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U.

[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, we do not retreat from our earlier holdings that standing may be predicated on noneconomic injury.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. SCRAP,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#686">412 U. S. 686</a></span>-688; <em>Association of Data Processing Service Orgs. v.

They learned of the transfer through a news release.  Their claim that the Government has violated the Establishment Clause does not provide a special license to roam the country in search of governmental wrongdoing and to reveal their discoveries in federal court. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The federal courts were simply not constituted as ombudsmen of the general welfare. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 454 U. S. 488</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in this case ignored unambiguous limitations on taxpayer and citizen standing.  It appears to have done so out of the conviction that enforcement of the Establishment Clause demands special exceptions from the requirement that a plaintiff allege "<em>distinct and palpable injury to himself,\' . . . that is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted."  <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/case.html#100">441 U. S. 100</a></span> (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#501">422 U. S. 501</a></span>).  The court derived precedential comfort from <em>Flast v. Cohen:</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>"The underlying justification for according standing in <em>Flast,</em> it seems, was the implicit recognition that the Establishment Clause does create in every citizen a personal constitutional right, such that any citizen, including taxpayers, may contest under that clause the constitutionality of federal expenditures."</p>\n<p>619 F.2d at 262. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The concurring opinion was even more direct.  In its view, "statutes alleged to violate the Establishment Clause may not have an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 454 U. S. 489</a></p><p> individual impact sufficient to confer standing in the traditional sense."  <em>Id.</em> at 267-268.  To satisfy "the need for an available plaintiff," <em>id.</em> at 267, and thereby to assure a basis for judicial review, respondents should be granted standing because, "as a practical matter, no one is better suited to bring this lawsuit and thus vindicate the freedoms embodied in the Establishment Clause," <em>id.</em> at 266.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the foregoing is the philosophy that the business of the federal courts is correcting constitutional errors, and that "cases and controversies" are, at best, merely convenient vehicles for doing so, and, at worst, nuisances that may be dispensed with when they become obstacles to that transcendent endeavor.  This philosophy has no place in our constitutional scheme.  It does not become more palatable when the underlying merits concern the Establishment Clause.  Respondents\' claim of standing implicitly rests on the presumption that violations of the Establishment Clause typically will not cause injury sufficient to confer standing under the "traditional" view of Art. III.  But "[t]he assumption that, if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing."  <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html#227">418 U. S. 227</a></span>.  This view would convert standing into a requirement that must be observed only when satisfied.  Moreover, we are unwilling to assume that injured parties are nonexistent simply because they have not joined respondents in their suit.  The law of averages is not a substitute for standing.</p>\n<p>Were we to accept respondents\' claim of standing in this case, there would be no principled basis for confining our exception to litigants relying on the Establishment Clause.  Ultimately, that exception derives from the idea that the judicial power requires nothing more for its invocation than important issues and able litigants.

Among the central purposes of the Act was the "maximum utilization of property already owned by the Government and minimum purchasing of new property."  S.Rep. No. 475, <em>supra,</em> at 4.  Congress recognized, however, that, from time to time, certain property would become surplus to the Government, and in particular, property acquired by the military to meet wartime contingencies.  Congress provided a means of disposing of this property to meet well-recognized public priorities, including education.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 475, <em>supra,</em> at 4-5; H.R.Rep.

Although public funds were expended to establish the Valley Forge General Hospital, the land was acquired and the facilities constructed 30 years prior to the challenged transfer.  Respondents do not challenge this expenditure, and we do not immediately perceive how such a challenge might now be raised.  Nor do respondents dispute the Government\'s conclusion that the property has become useless for federal purposes, and ought to be disposed of in some productive manner.  In fact, respondents\' only objection is that the Government did not receive adequate consideration for the transfer, because petitioner\'s use of the property will not confer a public benefit.  <em>See</em> Brief for Respondents Americans United <em>et al.</em> 13.  Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that this proposition is true, an assumption by no means clear, there is no basis for believing that a transfer to a different purchaser would have added to Government receipts.  As the Government argues, "the ultimate purchaser would, in all likelihood, have been another non-profit institution or local school district, rather than a purchaser for cash."  Brief for Federal Respondents 30.  Moreover, each year of delay in disposing of the property <em>depleted</em> the Treasury by the amounts necessary to maintain a facility that had lost its value to the Government.

The plaintiffs in <em>Schempp</em> had standing not because their complaint rested on the Establishment Clause -- for, as <em>Doremus</em> demonstrated, that is insufficient -- but because impressionable schoolchildren were subjected to unwelcome religious exercises or were forced to assume special burdens to avoid them.

But, in consequence, there is an impulse to decide difficult questions of substantive law obliquely in the course of opinions purporting to do nothing more than determine what the Court labels "standing"; this accounts for the phenomenon of opinions, such as the one today, that tend merely to obfuscate, rather than inform, our understanding of the meaning of rights under the law.  The serious by-product of that practice is that the Court disregards its constitutional responsibility when, by failing to acknowledge the protections afforded by the Constitution, it uses "standing to slam the courthouse door against plaintiffs who are entitled to full consideration of their claims on the merits."  [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The opinion of the Court is a stark example of this unfortunate trend of resolving cases at the "threshold" while obscuring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 454 U.

The Court waxes eloquent on the blend of prudential and constitutional considerations that combine to create our misguided "standing" jurisprudence.  <em>But not one word is said about the Establishment Clause right that the plaintiff seeks to enforce.</em>  And despite its pat recitation of our standing decisions, the opinion utterly fails, except by the sheerest form of <em>ipse dixit,</em> to explain why this case is unlike <em>Flast v.

Cases of this Court have identified the two essential components of this "personal stake" requirement.  Plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened with, some "distinct and palpable injury," <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U.

In addition, there must be some causal connection between plaintiff\'s asserted injury and defendant\'s challenged action.  <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U.

III court to ascertain that both requirements are met before proceeding to exercise its authority on behalf of any plaintiff, whether the form of relief requested is equitable or monetary.</p>\n<p>But the existence of Art.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Neither "palpable injury" nor "causation" is a term of unvarying meaning.  There is much in the way of "mutual understandings" and "common law traditions" that necessarily guides the definitional inquiry. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In addition, the Constitution, and by legislation the Congress, may impart a new, and on occasion unique, meaning to the terms "injury" and "causation" in particular statutory or constitutional contexts.  The Court makes a fundamental mistake when it determines that a plaintiff has failed to satisfy the two-pronged "injury-in-fact" test, or indeed any other test of "standing," without first determining whether the Constitution or a statute defines injury, and creates a cause of action for redress of that injury, in precisely the circumstance presented to the Court.</p>\n<p>It may, of course, happen that a person believing himself injured in some obscure manner by government action will be held to have no legal right under the constitutional or statutory provision upon which he relies, and will not be permitted to complain of the invasion of another person\'s "rights."

S. 493</a></p><p> is quite another matter to employ the rhetoric of "standing" to deprive a person, whose interest is clearly protected by the law, of the opportunity to prove that his own rights have been violated.  It is in precisely that dissembling enterprise that the Court indulges today.</p>\n<p>The "case and controversy" limitation of Art. III overrides no other provision of the Constitution. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  To construe that Article to deny standing "<em>to the class for whose sake [a] constitutional protection is given,\'" <em>Jones v.

How are we to discern whether a particular person is to be afforded a right of action in the courts?  The Framers did not, of course, employ the modern vocabulary of standing.  But this much is clear:  the drafters of the Bill of Rights surely intended that the particular beneficiaries of their legacy should enjoy rights legally enforceable in courts of law.

Mellon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html">262 U. S. 447</a></span> (1923), involved a challenge to the Maternity Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 224, which provided financial grants to States that agreed to cooperate in programs designed to reduce infant and maternal mortality.  Appellant contended that Congress, in enacting the program, had exceeded its authority under Art. I, and had intruded on authority reserved to the States.  The Court described Mrs. Frothingham\'s claim as follows:</p>\n<p>"[T]his plaintiff alleges . . . that she is a taxpayer of the United States; and her contention, though not clear, seems to be that the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to increase the burden of future taxation, and thereby take her property without due process of law.  The right of a taxpayer to enjoin the execution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 454 U. S. 495</a></p><p> of a federal appropriation act, on the ground that it is invalid and will result in taxation for illegal purposes, has never been passed upon by this Court."</p>\n<p>262 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#486">262 U. S. 486</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court conceded that it had historically treated the interest of a <em>municipal</em> taxpayer in the application of the municipality\'s funds as sufficiently direct and immediate to warrant injunctive relief to prevent misuse.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>Bradfield v. Roberts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/291/case.html">175 U. S. 291</a></span> (1899), in which the Court permitted a federal taxpayer to present an Establishment Clause challenge to the use of federal money for the construction of hospital buildings in the District of Columbia, was held to fall within this rule, because it was appropriate to treat the District of Columbia as a municipality. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  But the Court distinguished Mrs. Frothingham\'s action against the United States:</p>\n<p>"[T]he relation of a taxpayer of the United States to the Federal Government is very different.  His interest in the moneys of the Treasury -- partly realized from taxation and partly from other sources -- is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 454 U. S. 496</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public, and not of individual, concern."</p>\n<p>262 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#487">262 U. S. 487</a></span>.  After noting the importance of judicial restraint, the Court concluded:</p>\n<p>"The party who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#488">262 U. S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Frothingham\'s</em> reasoning remains obscure. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  The principal interpretive difficulty lies in the manner in which <em>Frothingham</em> chose to blend the language of policy with seemingly absolute statements about jurisdiction.  For example, the Court commented with significance on the sheer number of taxpayers who might have raised a claim similar to that of Mrs. Frothingham.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#487">262 U. S. 487</a></span>.  Yet it can hardly be argued that the Constitution bars from federal court a plaintiff who has suffered injury merely because others are similarly aggrieved.  "[S]tanding is not to be denied simply </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 454 U. S. 497</a></p><p> because many people suffer the same injury."  <em>United States v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html">412 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#687">412 U. S. 687</a></span> (1973).  And it is equally clear that the Constitution draws no distinction between injuries that are large and those that are comparatively small.  The line between more dollars and less is no valid constitutional measure.  <em>Cf. Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#48">330 U. S. 48</a></span>-49 (1947) (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  The only distinction that a Constitution guaranteeing justice to all can recognize is one between some injury and none at all. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Frothingham</em> also stressed the indirectness of the taxpayer\'s injury.  But, as a matter of Art. III standing, if the causal relationship is sufficiently certain, the length of the causal chain is irrelevant. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  <em>See Warth v. Seldin,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html#505">422 U. S. 505</a></span>.  The financial stake of a federal taxpayer in the outcome of a lawsuit challenging an allegedly unlawful federal expenditure is not qualitatively different from that of a state or a municipal taxpayer attacking a local expenditure.  More importantly, the injury suffered by a taxpayer is not dependent on the extent of his tax payment.  The concept of taxpayer injury necessarily recognizes the continuing stake of the taxpayer in the disposition of the Treasury to which he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 454 U. S. 498</a></p><p> has contributed his taxes, and his right to have those funds put to lawful uses.  Until <em>Frothingham,</em> there was nothing in our precedents to indicate that this concept, so comfortably applied to municipal taxpayers, was inconsistent with the framework of rights and remedies established by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>The explanation for the limit on federal taxpayer "standing" imposed by <em>Frothingham</em> must be sought in more substantive realms.  Justice Harlan, dissenting in <em>Flast,</em> came close to identifying what I consider the unstated premise of the <em>Frothingham</em> rule:</p>\n<p>"[The] taxpayer\'s complaint can consist only of an allegation that public funds have been, or shortly will be, expended for purposes inconsistent with the Constitution.  The taxpayer cannot ask the return of any portion of his previous tax payments, cannot prevent the collection of any existing tax debt, and cannot demand an adjudication of the propriety of any particular level of taxation.  His tax payments are received for the general purposes of the United States, and are, upon proper receipt, lost in the general revenues."</p>\n<p>392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#128">392 U. S. 128</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 454 U. S. 499</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the Government argued in <em>Flast</em> that taxpayer suits involve only a disagreement by the taxpayer with the uses to which tax revenues were committed, and that the resolution of such disagreements is entrusted to branches of the Federal Government other than the judiciary.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#98">392 U. S. 98</a></span>.  The arguments of both the Government and Justice Harlan are phrased, as they must be, not in the language of "standing," but of "legal rights" and "justiciable issues."</p>\n<p>The <em>Frothingham</em> rule may be seen as founded solely on the prudential judgment by the Court that precipitate and unnecessary interference in the activities of a coequal branch of government should be avoided.  Alternatively, <em>Frothingham</em> may be construed as resting upon an unarticulated, constitutionally established barrier between Congress\' power to tax and its power to spend, which barrier makes it analytically impossible to mount an assault on the former through a challenge to the latter.  But it is sufficient for present purposes to say that <em>Frothingham</em> held that the federal taxpayer has no continuing legal interest in the affairs of the Treasury analogous to a shareholder\'s continuing interest in the conduct of a corporation.</p>\n<p>Whatever its provenance, the general rule of <em>Frothingham</em> displays sound judgment:  courts must be circumspect in dealing with the taxing power in order to avoid unnecessary intrusion into the functions of the Legislative and Executive Branches.  Congress\' purpose in taxing will not ordinarily affect the validity of the tax.  Unless the tax operates unconstitutionally, <em>see, e.g., Murdock v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/105/case.html">319 U. S. 105</a></span> (1943), the taxpayer may not object to the use of his funds.  Mrs. Frothingham\'s argument, that the use of tax funds for purposes unauthorized by the Constitution amounted to a violation of due process, did not provide her with the required legal interest because the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect taxpayers against increases in tax liability.  <em>See Flast v. Cohen,</em> 392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#105">392 U. S. 105</a></span>.  Mrs. Frothingham\'s claim was thus reduced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 454 U. S. 500</a></p><p> to an assertion of "the States\' interest in their legislative prerogatives," <em>ibid.,</em> a third-party claim that could properly be barred. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  But in <em>Flast,</em> the Court faced a different sort of constitutional claim, and found itself compelled to retreat from the general assertion in <em>Frothingham</em> that taxpayers have no interest in the disposition of their tax payments.  To understand why <em>Frothingham\'s</em> bar necessarily gave way in the face of an Establishment Clause claim, we must examine the right asserted by a taxpayer making such a claim.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In 1947, nine Justices of this Court recognized that the Establishment Clause does impose a very definite restriction on the power to tax.

The introduction of that bill in the state assembly prompted James Madison to prepare and circulate his famous "Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments," imploring the legislature to establish and maintain the complete separation of religion and civil authority, and thus to reject the bill.  In the end, the bill was rejected by the Virginia Legislature, and, in its place, Madison succeeded in securing the enactment of "A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom," first introduced in the Virginia General Assembly seven years earlier by Thomas Jefferson.  98 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/98/145/case.html#163">98 U.

Because Madison and Jefferson played such leading roles in the events leading to the adoption of the First Amendment, the <em>Everson</em> opinions did not hesitate to reproduce the partial text of their Virginia bill as a primary source for understanding the objectives, and protections, afforded by the more concise phrasing of the Establishment Clause.  <em>Everson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#12">330 U.

Extracts from that bill also bear repeating in the present context.  The preamble provided, in part:</p>\n<p>"[T]o compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern."</p>\n<p>12 Hening\'s Stat. 85.  Its operative language emphatically stated:</p>\n<p>"That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 86.

Tithes had been the lifeblood of establishment before and after other compulsions disappeared.  Madison and his coworkers made no exceptions or abridgments to the complete separation [between church and state] they created.  Their objection was not to small tithes.

Appellants urged that the use of federal funds for such a purpose violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, and sought a declaration that this use of federal funds was not authorized by the Act, or that, to the extent the use was authorized, the Act was "unconstitutional and void."  Appellants further sought an injunction to bar appellees from approving any expenditure of funds for the allegedly unconstitutional purposes.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#86">392 U.

The Court held, however, that the <em>Frothingham</em> barrier could be overcome by any claim that met both requirements of a two-part "nexus" test.  The Justices who participated in <em>Flast</em> were not unaware of the Court\'s continued recognition of a federally cognizable "case or controversy" when a <em>local</em> taxpayer seeks to challenge as unconstitutional the use of a <em>municipality\'s</em> funds -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 454 U. S. 507</a></p><p> the propriety of which had, of course, gone unquestioned in <em>Everson.</em> [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  The Court was aware as well of the rule stated in <em>Doremus v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/case.html">342 U. S. 429</a></span> (1952), that the interest of a taxpayer, even one raising an Establishment Clause claim, was limited to the actions of a government involving the expenditure of funds.  But in reaching its holding, it is also quite clear that the Court was responding, not only to <em>Everson\'s</em> continued acceptance of municipal taxpayer actions, but also to <em>Everson\'s</em> exposition of the history and meaning of the Establishment Clause.  <em>See Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#103">392 U. S. 103</a></span>-104.</p>\n<p>It is at once apparent that the test of standing formulated by the Court in <em>Flast</em> sought to reconcile the developing doctrine of taxpayer "standing" with the Court\'s historical understanding that the Establishment Clause was intended to prohibit the Federal Government from using tax funds for the advancement of religion, and thus the constitutional imperative of taxpayer standing in certain cases brought pursuant to the Establishment Clause.  The two-pronged "nexus" test offered by the Court, despite its general language, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 454 U. S. 508</a></p><p> best understood as</p>\n<p>"a determinant of standing of plaintiffs alleging only injury as taxpayers who challenge alleged violations of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment,"</p>\n<p>and not as a general statement of standing principles.  <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html">418 U.

The test explains what forms of governmental action may be attacked by someone alleging only taxpayer status, and, without ruling out the possibility that history might reveal another similarly founded provision, explains why an Establishment Clause claim is treated differently from any other assertion that the Federal Government has exceeded the bounds of the law in allocating its largesse.  Thus, consistent with <em>Doremus, Flast</em> required, as the first prong of its test, that the taxpayer demonstrate a logical connection between his taxpayer status and the type of legislation attacked.  <em>Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U.

But <em>Flast</em> did not depart from the principle that no judgment about standing should be made without a fundamental understanding of the rights at issue.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#102">392 U. S. 102</a></span>.  The two-part <em>Flast</em> test did not supply the rationale for the Court\'s decision, but rather its exposition:  that rationale was supplied by an understanding of the nature of the restrictions on government power imposed by the Constitution, and the intended beneficiaries of those restrictions.</p>\n<p>It may be that Congress can tax for <em>almost</em> any reason, or for no reason at all.  There is, so far as I have been able to discern, but one constitutionally imposed limit on that authority.  Congress cannot use tax money to support a church, or to encourage religion.  That is "<em>the</em> forbidden exaction."  <em>Everson v. Board of Education,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#45">330 U. S. 45</a></span> (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).  <em>See Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#115">392 U. S. 115</a></span>-116 (Fortas, J., concurring).  In absolute terms, the history of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment makes this clear.  History also makes it clear that the federal taxpayer is a singularly "proper and appropriate party to invoke a federal court\'s jurisdiction" to challenge a federal bestowal of largesse as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  Each, and indeed every, federal taxpayer suffers precisely the injury that the Establishment Clause guards against when the Federal Government directs that funds be taken from the pocketbooks of the citizenry and placed into the coffers of the ministry.</p>\n<p>A taxpayer cannot be asked to raise his objection to such use of his funds at the time he pays his tax.  Apart from the unlikely circumstance in which the Government announced in advance that a particular levy would be used for religious subsidies, taxpayers could hardly assert that they were being injured until the Government actually lent its support to a religious venture.  Nor would it be reasonable to require him to address his claim to those officials charged with the collection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 454 U. S. 510</a></p><p> of federal taxes.  Those officials would be without the means to provide appropriate redress -- there is no practical way to segregate the complaining taxpayer\'s money from that being devoted to the religious purpose.  Surely, then, a taxpayer must have standing at the time that he learns of the Government\'s alleged Establishment Clause violation to seek equitable relief in order to halt the continuing and intolerable burden on his pocketbook, his conscience, and his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Blind to history, the Court attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Flast</em> by wrenching snippets of language from our opinions and by perfunctorily applying that language under color of the first prong of <em>Flast\'s</em> two-part nexus test.  The tortuous distinctions thus produced are specious, at best:  at worst, they are pernicious to our constitutional heritage.</p>\n<p>First, the Court finds this case different from <em>Flast</em> because here, the "source of [plaintiffs\'] complaint is not a <em>congressional</em> action, but a decision by HEW to transfer a parcel of federal property."  <em>Ante,</em> at 479 (emphasis added).  This attempt at distinction cannot withstand scrutiny.  <em>Flast</em> involved a challenge to the actions of the Commissioner of Education, and other officials of HEW, in disbursing funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to "religious and sectarian" schools.  Plaintiffs disclaimed "any intent[ion] to challenge . . . all programs under . . . the Act."  <em>Flast, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#87">392 U. S. 87</a></span>.  Rather, they claimed that defendant administrators\' approval of such expenditures was not authorized by the Act, or alternatively, to the extent the expenditures were authorized, the Act was "unconstitutional and void."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the present case, respondents challenge HEW\'s grant of property pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, seeking to enjoin HEW "from making a grant of this and other property to the [defendant] so long as such a grant will violate the Establishment Clause."  App. 12.  It may be that the Court is concerned with the adequacy of respondents\' pleading; respondents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 454 U. S. 511</a></p><p> have not, in so many words, asked for a declaration that the "Federal Property and Administrative Services Act is unconstitutional and void to the extent that it authorizes HEW\'s actions."  I would not construe their complaint so narrowly.</p>\n<p>More fundamentally, no clear division can be drawn in this context between actions of the Legislative Branch and those of the Executive Branch.  To be sure, the First Amendment is phrased as a restriction on Congress\' legislative authority; this is only natural, since the Constitution assigns the authority to legislate and appropriate only to the Congress.  But it is difficult to conceive of an expenditure for which the last governmental actor, either implementing directly the legislative will or acting within the scope of legislatively delegated authority, is not an Executive Branch official.  The First Amendment binds the Government as a whole, regardless of which branch is at work in a particular instance.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s second purported distinction between this case and <em>Flast</em> is equally unavailing.  The majority finds it "decisive" that the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 "was an evident exercise of Congress\' power under the Property Clause, Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 3, cl. 2," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#480">454 U. S. 480</a></span>, while the Government action in <em>Flast</em> was taken under Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8.  The Court relies on <em>United States v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/case.html">418 U. S. 166</a></span> (1974), and <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/case.html">418 U. S. 208</a></span> (1974), to support the distinction between the two Clauses, noting that those cases involved alleged deviations from the requirements of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 7, and Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 2, respectively.  The standing defect in each case was not, however, the failure to allege a violation of the Spending Clause; rather, the taxpayers in those cases had not complained of the distribution of Government largesse, and thus failed to meet the essential requirement of taxpayer standing recognized in <em>Doremus.</em></p>\n<p>It can make no constitutional difference in the case before us whether the donation to the petitioner here was in the form of a cash grant to build a facility, <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html">Tilton v. Richardson,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 454 U. S. 512</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html">403 U. S. 672</a></span> (1971), or in the nature of a gift of property including a facility already built.  That this is a meaningless distinction is illustrated by <em>Tilton.</em>  In that case, taxpayers were afforded standing to object to the fact that the Government had not received adequate assurance that, if the property that it financed for use as an educational facility was later converted to religious use, it would receive full value for the property, as the Constitution requires.  The complaint here is precisely that, although the property at issue is actually being used for a sectarian purpose, the Government has not received, nor demanded, full value payment. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Whether undertaken pursuant to the Property Clause or the Spending Clause, the breach of the Establishment Clause, and the relationship of the taxpayer to that breach, is precisely the same.

In such situations, the Constitution requires us to determine whether the injury alleged is sufficiently "palpable" to fall within the contemplation of Art. III.  If plaintiff has suffered injury in fact within the contemplation of Art. III, but is not obviously within the reach of the particular statutory or constitutional provision upon which the plaintiff founds his claim, we then bring prudential considerations to bear to determine whether the plaintiff should be allowed to maintain his action.  <em>See Duke Power Co. v.

Nevertheless, I do not suggest that the <em>Frothingham</em> limitation on federal taxpayer suits should be abandoned.  The barrier it evinces between the taxing power and the spending power, whether it be deemed one of constitutional construction or judicial prudence, reflects fundamental conceptions about the nature of the legislative process, and is, in any event, now firmly embedded in our cases.

At the time of its transfer to the petitioner, its fair market value was approximately $1.3 million.  <em>Americans United v. U.S. Dept. of HEW,</em> 619 F.2d 252, 253 (CA3 1980).</p>\n<p>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 clearly requires that, whenever possible, fair market value is to be received for property transferred pursuant to its provisions.  <em>See</em> 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484(e)(1), 484(e)(3)(G).  Proceeds "from any sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus property, shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. . . ."  40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 485(a).</p>\n<p>The Act provides, however, that "surplus real property, including buildings, fixtures and equipment situated thereon" may be designated by HEW as necessary for "school, classroom, or other educational use."  40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484(k)(1).  Such property may be transferred to a "nonprofit educational institution."  40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484(k)(1)(A).  In fixing the price of such property, the Secretary is required to consider any benefit that may accrue to the United States from the use of the property.  40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 484(k)(1)(C).  By failing to require any payment from petitioner college, the Secretary apparently determined that the benefit to the United States exceeded the fair market value.  But it is entirely clear from <em>Tilton</em> that, if the facility is and was used for sectarian purposes, the Government was required to obtain full market value at the time such use commences.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>The Framers of the First Amendment could not have viewed it as less objectionable to the taxpayer to learn that his tax funds were used by his Government to purchase property, construct a church, and deed the property to a religious order, than to find his Government providing the funds to a church to undertake its own construction.  So far as the Establishment Clause and the position of the taxpayer are concerned, the situations are interchangeable.  Surely James Madison perceived no nice distinction between a grant of land and a grant of funds when he vetoed a bill providing certain land to a church:</p>\n<p>"[T]he bill, in reserving a certain parcel of land of the United States for the use of said [church], comprises a principle and precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States for the use and support of religious societies, contrary to the article of the Constitution which declares that \'Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.\'"</p>\n<p>J.

Justice Fortas made this point directly:</p>\n<p>"I agree that the congressional powers to tax and spend are limited by the prohibition upon Congress to enact laws \'respecting an establishment of religion.\'  This thesis, slender as its basis is, provides a direct \'nexus,\' as the Court puts it, between the use and collection of taxes and the congressional action here.  Because of this unique \'nexus,\' in my judgment, it is not far-fetched to recognize that a taxpayer has a special claim to status as a litigant in a case raising the \'establishment\' issue.  This special claim is enough, I think, to permit us to allow the suit, coupled, as it is, with the interest which the taxpayer and all other citizens have in the church-state issue.  In terms of the structure and basic philosophy of our constitutional government, it would be difficult to point to any issue that has a more intimate, pervasive, and fundamental impact upon the life of the taxpayer -- and upon the life of all citizens."</p>\n<p>"Perhaps the vital interest of a citizen in the establishment issue, without reference to his taxpayer\'s status, would be acceptable as a basis for this challenge.  We need not decide this.  But certainly, I believe, we must recognize that our principle of judicial scrutiny of legislative acts which raise important constitutional questions requires that the issue here presented -- the separation of state and church -- which the Founding Fathers regarded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 454 U. S. 515</a></p><p> as fundamental to our constitutional system -- should be subjected to judicial testing.  This is not a question which we, if we are to be faithful to our trust, should consign to limbo, unacknowledged, unresolved, and undecided."</p>\n<p>"On the other hand, the urgent necessities of this case and the precarious opening through which we find our way to confront it, do not demand that we open the door to a general assault upon exercises of the spending power.  The status of taxpayer should not be accepted as a launching pad for an attack upon any target other than legislation affecting the Establishment Clause."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/case.html#115">392 U.
