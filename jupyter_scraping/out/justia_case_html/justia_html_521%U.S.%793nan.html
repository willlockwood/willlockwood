Respondent New York physicians assert that, although it would be consistent with the standards of their medical practices to prescribe lethal medication for mentally competent, terminally ill patients who are suffering great pain and desire a doctor\'s help in taking their own lives, they are deterred from doing so by New York\'s assisted-suicide ban. They, and three gravely ill patients who have since died, sued the State\'s Attorney General, claiming that the ban violates the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Equal Protection Clause. The Federal District Court disagreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding (1) that New York accords different treatment to those competent, terminally ill persons who wish to hasten their deaths by self-administering prescribed drugs than it does to those who wish to do so by directing the removal of life-support systems, and (2) that this supposed unequal treatment is not rationally related to any legitimate state interests.</p><p><i>Held: </i>New York\'s prohibition on assisting suicide does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

Supp. 78, 84-85 (SDNY 1994).</p><p>The District Court disagreed: "[I]t is hardly unreasonable or irrational for the State to recognize a difference between allowing nature to take its course, even in the most severe situations, and intentionally using an artificial deathproducing device." <i>Id., </i>at 84. The court noted New York\'s "obvious legitimate interests in preserving life, and in protecting vulnerable persons," and concluded that "[u]nder the United States Constitution and the federal system it establishes, the resolution of this issue is left to the normal democratic processes within the State." <i>Id., </i>at 84-85.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/80/716/">80 F.3d 716</a> (1996). The court determined that, despite the assisted-suicide ban\'s apparent general applicability, "New York law does not treat equally all competent persons who are in the final stages of fatal illness and wish to hasten their deaths," because "those in the final stages of terminal illness who are on life-support systems are allowed to hasten their deaths by directing the removal of such systems; but those who are similarly situated, except for the previous attachment of life-sustaining equipment, are not allowed to hasten death by self-administering prescribed drugs." <i>Id., </i>at 727, 729. In the court\'s view, "[t]he ending of life by [the withdrawal of life-support systems] is <i>nothing more nor less than assisted suicide." Id., </i>at 729 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals then examined whether this supposed unequal treatment was rationally related to any legitimate state</p><p>their lives. App. 25-26; Declaration of William A.

We granted certiorari, 518 U.

This conclusion depends on the submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical treatment "is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide." <i>Ibid. </i>Unlike the Court of Appeals, we think the distinction between assisting suicide and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, a distinction widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession 6 and in our legal traditions, is both important and</p><p>6 The American Medical Association emphasizes the "fundamental difference between refusing life-sustaining treatment and demanding a lifeending treatment."

The same is true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; in some cases, painkilling drugs may hasten a patient\'s death, but the physician\'s purpose and intent is, or may be, only to ease his patient\'s pain. A doctor who assists a suicide, however, "must, necessarily and indubitably, intend primarily that the patient be made dead." <i>Id., </i>at 367. Similarly, a patient who commits suicide with a doctor\'s aid necessarily has the specific intent to end his or her own life, while a patient who refuses or discontinues treatment might not.

When Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context vii (1994). In the Task Force\'s view, "allowing decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment and allowing assisted suicide or euthanasia have radically different consequences and meanings for public policy." <i>Id., </i>at 146.</p><p>This Court has also recognized, at least implicitly, the distinction between letting a patient die and making that patient die. In <i>Cruzan </i>v. <i>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/261/case.html">497 U. S. 261</a>, 278 (1990), we concluded that "[t]he principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions," and we assumed the existence of such a right for purposes of that case, id., at 279. But our assumption of a right to refuse treatment was grounded not, as the Court of Appeals supposed, on the proposition that patients have a general and abstract "right to hasten death," 80 F. 3d, at 727-728, but on well-established, traditional rights to bodily integrity and freedom from unwanted touching, <i>Cruzan, </i>497 U. S., at 278-279; <i>id., </i>at 287288 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring). In fact, we observed that "the majority of States in this country have laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide." <i>Id., </i>at 280. <i>Cruzan </i>therefore provides no support for the notion that refusing life-sustaining medical treatment is "nothing more nor less than suicide."</p><p>For all these reasons, we disagree with respondents\' claim that the distinction between refusing lifesaving medical treatment and assisted suicide is "arbitrary" and "irrational."

By permitting everyone to refuse unwanted medical treatment while prohibiting anyone from assisting a suicide, New York law follows a longstanding and rational distinction.</p><p>N ew York\'s reasons for recognizing and acting on this distinction-including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians\' role as their patients\' healers; protecting vulnerable people from</p><p>at 729.

Rousseau, Terminal Sedation in the Care of Dying Patients, 156 Archives Internal Med. 1785, 1785-1786 (1996)). Just as a State may prohibit assisting suicide while permitting patients to refuse unwanted lifesaving treatment, it may permit palliative care related to that refusal, which may have the foreseen but unintended "double effect" of hastening the patient\'s death. See New York Task Force, When Death is Sought, supra n. 6, at 163 ("It is widely recognized that the provision of pain medication is ethically and professionally acceptable even when the treatment may hasten the patient\'s death, if the medication is intended to alleviate pain and severe discomfort, not to cause death").</p><p>12We do not insist, as JUSTICE STEVENS suggests, <i>ante, </i>at 750 (opinion concurring in judgments), that "in all cases there will in fact be a significant difference between the intent of the physicians, the patients, or the families [in withdrawal-of-treatment and physician-assisted-suicide cases]." See supra, at 801-802 ("[A] physician who withdraws, or honors a patient\'s refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment purposefully intends,<i>or may so intend, </i>only to respect his patient\'s wishes ...  The same is true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; ...  the physician\'s purpose and intent is, <i>or may be, </i>only to ease his patient\'s pain" (emphasis added)).
