The issues in this case were joined on pleas of non assumpsit, and payment. When the jury were about to be impanneled, the defendant\'s counsel moved to strike out the former plea, by which (leaving only the affirmative plea of payment) he would be entitled to the conclusion, in addressing the jury. The plaintiff\'s counsel objected, with an allegation, that upon the issues, as they now stood, they had been obliged to send a commission into another state, to prove the sale and delivery of the goods, for which the action was brought. </p><p> And the COURT refused to allow the plea of non assumpsit to be struck off.

Allison approved, in writing, of the proposed payment, and the certificates were delivered to him; but it became a question, how far that delivery was satisfaction to the plaintiffs? And Allison being dead, M. Levy, offered himself as a witness to prove, that on a question of bail, before M\'KEAN, C. J.

They said, it operated to relieve the plaintiff, from the necessity of proving the assumption, and was, therefore, for his advantage.
