The Act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing scienter, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intention \xe2\x80\x9cto deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/index.html">425 U.

Respondents (Shareholders) purchased Tellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001.  They filed a class action, alleging that Tellabs and petitioner Notebaert, then Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 chief executive officer and president, had engaged in securities fraud in violation of \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, and that Notebaert was a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling person\xe2\x80\x9d under the 1934 Act, and therefore derivatively liable for the company\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent acts.  Tellabs moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Shareholders had failed to plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA requires.  The District Court agreed, dismissing the complaint without prejudice.  The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding references to 27 confidential sources and making further, more specific, allegations concerning Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.  The District Court again dismissed, this time with prejudice.  The Shareholders had sufficiently pleaded that Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s statements were misleading, the court determined, but they had insufficiently alleged that he acted with scienter.  The Seventh Circuit reversed in relevant part.  Like the District Court, it found that the Shareholders had pleaded the misleading character of Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s statements with sufficient particularity.  Unlike the District Court, however, it concluded that the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged that Notebaert acted with the requisite state of mind.  In evaluating whether the PSLRA\xe2\x80\x99s pleading standard is met, the Circuit said, courts should examine all of the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to decide whether collectively they establish an inference of scienter; the complaint would survive, the court stated, if a reasonable person could infer from the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>To qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d within the intendment of \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable\xe2\x80\x94it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Setting a uniform pleading standard for \xc2\xa710(b) actions was among Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objectives in enacting the PSLRA.  Designed to curb perceived abuses of the \xc2\xa710(b) private action, the PSLRA installed both substantive and procedural controls.  As relevant here, \xc2\xa721D(b) of the PSLRA \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[d] heightened pleading requirements in [\xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935] actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dabit, </em>547 U. S., at 81<em>.  </em>In the instant case, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the complaint sufficiently specified Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misleading statements and the reasons why the statements were misleading.  But those courts disagreed on whether the Shareholders, as required by \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), \xe2\x80\x9cstate[d] with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scienter],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2).  Congress did not shed much light on what facts would create a strong inference or how courts could determine the existence of the requisite inference.  With no clear guide from Congress other than its \xe2\x80\x9cinten[tion] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep., at 41, Courts of Appeals have diverged in construing the term \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Among the uncertainties, should courts consider competing inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter is \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d?  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s task is to prescribe a workable construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d standard, a reading geared to the PSLRA\xe2\x80\x99s twin goals:<em> </em>to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors\xe2\x80\x99 ability to recover on meritorious claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court establishes the following prescriptions: <em>First</em>, faced with a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a \xc2\xa710(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.  See <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a>, 164.  <em>Second</em>, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  The inquiry is whether <em>all </em>of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.  <em>Third</em>, in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d inference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.  The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative inquiry.  But in \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), Congress did not merely require plaintiffs to<em> </em>allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally <em>could </em>be drawn.  Instead, Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a powerful or cogent\xe2\x80\x94inference.  To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts giving rise to the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference,\xe2\x80\x9d a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.  The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, but it must be more than merely \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations.  A complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any plausible opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are considered, Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive.  The Court agrees that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference.  The absence of a motive allegation, however, is not fatal for allegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s entirety.  Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter.  While omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter, the court\xe2\x80\x99s job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to access all the allegations holistically.  Pp.  13\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit was unduly concerned that a court\xe2\x80\x99s comparative assessment of plausible inferences would impinge upon the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.  Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits.  It is the federal lawmaker\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the contours of\xe2\x80\x94including the pleading and proof requirements for\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa710(b) private actions.  This Court has never questioned that authority in general, or suggested, in particular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress from establishing whatever pleading requirements it finds appropriate for federal statutory claims.  Provided that the Shareholders have satisfied the congressionally \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 means of making an issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/187/315/index.html">187 U. S. 315</a>, 320, the case will fall within the jury\xe2\x80\x99s authority to assess the credibility of witnesses, resolve genuine issues of fact, and make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert and, by imputation, Tellabs acted with scienter.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more than she would be required to prove at trial.  A plaintiff alleging fraud under \xc2\xa710(b) must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter <em>at least as likely as</em> any plausible opposing inference.  At trial, she must then prove her case by a \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to consider whether the Shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 allegations warrant \xe2\x80\x9ca strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the required state of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2), in light of the prescriptions announced today.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/336/index.html">544 U. S. 336</a>, 345 (2005); <em>J. I. Case Co.</em> v. <em>Borak</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/426/index.html">377 U. S. 426</a>, 432 (1964).  Private securities fraud actions, however, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively to impose substantial costs on companies and individuals whose conduct conforms to the law.  See <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</em> v. <em>Dabit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/71/index.html"></a><a href="/us/547/71/index.html">547 U. S. 71</a>, 81 (2006).  As a check against abusive litigation by private parties, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exacting pleading requirements are among the control measures Congress included in the PSLRA.  The Act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing scienter, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intention \xe2\x80\x9cto deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/index.html"></a><a href="/us/425/185/index.html">425 U. S. 185</a>, 194, and n. 12 (1976); see 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(1),(2).  This case concerns the latter requirement.  As set out in \xc2\xa721D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, plaintiffs must \xe2\x80\x9cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress left the key term \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d undefined, and Courts of Appeals have divided on its meaning.  In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d standard would be met if the complaint \xe2\x80\x9callege[d] facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 F.\xc2\xa03d 588, 602 (2006).  That formulation, we conclude, does not capture the stricter demand Congress sought to convey in \xc2\xa721D(b)(2).  It does not suffice that a reasonable factfinder plausibly could infer from the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations the requisite state of mind.  Rather, to determine whether a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s scienter allegations can survive threshold inspection for sufficiency, a court governed by \xc2\xa721D(b)(2) must engage in a comparative evaluation; it must consider, not only inferences urged by the plaintiff, as the Seventh Circuit did, but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged.  An inference of fraudulent intent may be plausible, yet less cogent than other, nonculpable explanations for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  To qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d within the intendment of \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable\xe2\x80\x94it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized equipment used in fiber optic networks.  During the time period relevant to this case, petitioner Richard Notebaert was Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 chief executive officer and president.  Respondents (Shareholders) are persons who purchased Tellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001.  They accuse Tellabs and Notebaert (as well as several other Tellabs executives) of engaging in a scheme to deceive the investing public about the true value of Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 stock.  See 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 591; App. 94\xe2\x80\x9398.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beginning on December 11, 2000, the Shareholders allege, Notebaert (and by imputation Tellabs) \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely reassured public investors, in a series of statements \xe2\x80\xa6 that Tellabs was continuing to enjoy strong demand for its products and earning record revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d when, in fact, Notebaert knew the opposite was true.  <em>Id.,</em> at 94\xe2\x80\x9395, 98.  From December 2000 until the spring of 2001, the Shareholders claim, Notebaert knowingly misled the public in four ways.  437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 596.  First, he made statements indicating that demand for Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 flagship networking device, the TITAN 5500, was continuing to grow, when in fact demand for that product was waning.  <em>Id</em>., at 596, 597.  Second, Notebaert made statements indicating that the TITAN 6500, Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 next-generation networking device, was available for delivery, and that demand for that product was strong and growing, when in truth the product was not ready for delivery and demand was weak.  <em>Id</em>., at 596, 597\xe2\x80\x93598.  Third, he falsely represented Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 financial results for the fourth quarter of 2000 (and, in connection with those results, condoned the practice of \xe2\x80\x9cchannel stuffing,\xe2\x80\x9d under which Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products).  <em>Id.</em>, at 596, 598.  Fourth, Notebaert made a series of overstated revenue projections, when demand for the TITAN 5500 was drying up and production of the TITAN 6500 was behind schedule.  <em>Id.</em>, at 596, 598\xe2\x80\x93599.  Based on Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s sunny assessments, the Shareholders contend, market analysts recommended that investors buy Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 stock.  See <em>id</em>., at 592.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first public glimmer that business was not so healthy came in March 2001 when<em> </em>Tellabs modestly reduced its first quarter sales projections.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In the next months, Tellabs made progressively more cautious statements about its projected sales.  On June 19, 2001, the last day of the class period, Tellabs disclosed that demand for the TITAN 5500 had significantly dropped.  <em>Id</em>., at 593.  Simultaneously, the company substantially lowered its revenue projections for the second quarter of 2001.  The next day, the price of Tellabs stock, which had reached a high of $67 during the period, plunged to a low of $15.87.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 3, 2002, the Shareholders filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Their complaint stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that Tellabs and Notebaert had engaged in securities fraud in violation of \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U.

See 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 601\xe2\x80\x93602 (collecting cases).  Our task is to prescribe a workable construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d standard, a reading geared to the PSLRA\xe2\x80\x99s twin goals:<em> </em>to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors\xe2\x80\x99 ability to recover on meritorious claims.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We establish the following prescriptions: <em>First</em>, faced with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a \xc2\xa710(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.  See <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a>, 164 (1993).

See Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 26; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8, 20, 21.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.  See 5B Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa71357 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp. 2007).  The inquiry, as several Courts of Appeals have recognized, is whether <em>all </em>of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Baker Hughes Inc.</em>, 292 F.\xc2\xa03d 424, 431 (CA5 2002); <em>Gompper </em>v. <em>VISX, Inc.</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa03d 893, 897 (CA9 2002).  See also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d inference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.  The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative inquiry.  A complaint could survive, that court said, as long as it \xe2\x80\x9calleges facts from which, if true, a reasonable person could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent\xe2\x80\x9d; in other words, only \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a reasonable person could not draw such an inference from the alleged facts\xe2\x80\x9d would the defendant prevail on a motion to dismiss.  437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 602.  But in \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), Congress did not merely require plaintiffs to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a factual basis for [their] scienter allegations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cerner Corp. Securities Litigation</em>, 425 F.\xc2\xa03d 1079, 1084, 1085 (CA8 2005)), <em>i.e.</em>, to<em> </em>allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally <em>could </em>be drawn.  Instead, Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a powerful or cogent\xe2\x80\x94inference.  See American Heritage Dictionary 1717 (4th ed. 2000) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ersuasive, effective, and cogent\xe2\x80\x9d); 16 Oxford English Dictionary 949 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]owerful to demonstrate or convince\xe2\x80\x9d (definition 16b)); cf. 7 <em>id.,</em> at 924 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cinference\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca conclusion [drawn] from known or assumed facts or statements\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9creasoning from something known or assumed to something else which follows from it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strength of an inference cannot be decided in a vacuum.  The inquiry is inherently comparative: How likely is it that one conclusion, as compared to others, follows from the underlying facts?  To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter, a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.  The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, <em>i.e.</em>, of the \xe2\x80\x9csmoking-gun\xe2\x80\x9d genre, or even the \xe2\x80\x9cmost plausible of competing inferences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fidel</em>, 392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 227 (quoting <em>Helwig </em>v. <em>Vencor, Inc.</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa03d 540, 553 (CA6 2001) (en banc)).  Recall in this regard that \xc2\xa721D(b)\xe2\x80\x99s pleading requirements are but one constraint among many the PSLRA installed to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing meritorious actions to move forward.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9, and n.\xc2\xa04.<em> </em> Yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations.  A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are considered, Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive.  The Shareholders, Tellabs stresses, did not allege that Notebaert sold any shares during the class period.  See Brief for Petitioners 50 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of any allegations of motive color all the other allegations putatively giving rise to an inference of scienter.\xe2\x80\x9d).<font b="1">  While it is true that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that the absence of a motive allegation is not fatal.  See 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 601.  As earlier stated, <em>supra</em>, at 11, allegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the entirety of the complaint.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter.  For example, the Shareholders alleged that Tellabs flooded its customers with unwanted products, a practice known as \xe2\x80\x9cchannel stuffing.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  But they<em> </em>failed, Tellabs argues, to specify whether the channel stuffing allegedly known to Notebaert was the illegitimate kind (<em>e.g.</em>, writing orders for products customers had not requested) or the legitimate kind (<em>e.g.</em>, offering customers discounts as an incentive to buy).

See also <em>id</em>., at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (complaint lacks precise dates of reports critical to distinguish legitimate conduct from culpable conduct).  But see 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 598, 603\xe2\x80\x93604 (pointing to multiple particulars alleged by the Shareholders, including specifications as to timing).  We agree that omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter, for plaintiffs must \xe2\x80\x9cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2).  We reiterate, however, that the court\xe2\x80\x99s job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11; 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 601.  In sum, the reviewing court must ask: When the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively, would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference?\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accounting for its construction of \xc2\xa721D(b)(2), the Seventh Circuit explained that the court \xe2\x80\x9cth[ought] it wis[e] to adopt an approach that [could not] be misunderstood as a usurpation of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 602.  In our view, the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s concern was undue.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  A court\xe2\x80\x99s comparative assessment of plausible inferences, while constantly assuming the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to be true, we think it plain, does not impinge upon the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits.

The rule required defendants, in certain contract actions, to file an affidavit \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically stating \xe2\x80\xa6 , in precise and distinct terms, the grounds of his defen[s]e.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 318 (internal quotation marks omitted).

This Court upheld the District\xe2\x80\x99s rule against the contention that it violated the Seventh Amendment.  <em>Id</em>., at 320.  Just as the purpose of \xc2\xa721D(b) is to screen out frivolous complaints, the purpose of the prescription at issue in <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.</em> was to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve the courts from frivolous defen[s]es,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Explaining why the Seventh Amendment was not implicated, this Court said that the heightened pleading rule simply \xe2\x80\x9cprescribes the means of making an issue,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, when \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he issue [was] made as prescribed, the right of trial by jury accrues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> accord <em>Ex parte Peterson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/253/300/index.html">253 U.

If a jade falcon were stolen from a room to which only A and B had access, could it <em>possibly </em>be said there was a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d that B was the thief?  I think not, and I therefore think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test must fail.  In my view, the test should be whether the inference of scienter (if any) is <em>more plausible </em>than the inference of innocence.<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s explicit rejection of this reading, <em>ante, </em>at 12, rests on two assertions.  The first (doubtless true) is that the statute does not require that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he inference that the defendant acted with scienter \xe2\x80\xa6 be irrefutable, <em>i.e.</em>, of the \xe2\x80\x98smoking-gun\xe2\x80\x99 genre,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>It is up to Congress, however, and not to us, to determine what pleading standard would avoid those extremities while yet effectively deterring baseless actions.  Congress has expressed its determination in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d; it is our job to give that phrase its normal meaning.  And if we are to abandon text in favor of unexpressed purpose, as the Court does, it is inconceivable that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of stringent pleading requirements in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 somehow manifests the purpose of giving plaintiffs the edge in close cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s second assertion (also true) is that \xe2\x80\x9can inference at least as likely as competing inferences can, in some cases, warrant recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n. 5 (citing <em>Summers</em> v. <em>Tice</em>, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 84\xe2\x80\x9387, 199 P.\xc2\xa02d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x935 (1948) (in bank)).  <em>Summers </em>is a famous case, however, because it sticks out of the ordinary body of tort law like a sore thumb.  It represented \xe2\x80\x9ca relaxation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9csuch proof as is ordinarily required\xe2\x80\x9d to succeed in a negligence action.  <em>Id.</em>, at 86, 199 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  There is no indication that the statute at issue here was meant to relax the ordinary rule under which a tie goes to the defendant.  To the contrary, it explicitly strengthens that rule by extending it to the pleading stage of a case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <em>amici</em> suggests that my reading of the statute would transform the text from requiring a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d inference to requiring the \xe2\x80\x9cstrongest\xe2\x80\x9d inference.  See Brief for American Association for Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 27.  The point might have some force if Congress could have more clearly adopted my standard by using the word \xe2\x80\x9cstrongest\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the word \xe2\x80\x9cstrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the use of the superlative would not have made any sense given the provision\xe2\x80\x99s structure: What does it mean to require a plaintiff to plead \xe2\x80\x9cfacts giving rise to <em>the strongest</em> inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\xe2\x80\x9d?  It is certainly true that, if Congress had wanted to adopt my standard with even greater clarity, it could have restructured the entire provision\xe2\x80\x94to require, for example, that the plaintiff plead \xe2\x80\x9cfacts giving rise to <em>an inference of scienter that is more compelling than the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>But if one is to consider the possibility of total restructuring, it is equally true that, to express the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard, Congress could have demanded \xe2\x80\x9c<em>an inference of scienter that is at least as compelling as the inference that the defendant acted with a nonculpable state of mind</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Argument from the possibility of saying it differently is clearly a draw.  We must be content to give \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d its normal meaning.<font b="1">  I hasten to add that, while precision of interpretation should always be pursued for its own sake, I doubt that in this instance what I deem to be the correct test will produce results much different from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  How often is it that inferences are precisely in equipoise?  All the more reason, I think, to read the language for what it says.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court and the dissent criticize me for suggesting that there is only one reading of the text.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa05; <em>post</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  They are both mistaken.  I assert only that mine is the natural reading of the statute (<em>i.e.</em>, the normal reading), not that it is the only conceivable one.  The Court has no standing to object to this approach, since it concludes that, in another respect,<em> </em>the statute admits of only one natural reading, namely, that<em> </em>competing inferences must be weighed because the strong-inference requirement \xe2\x80\x9cis inherently comparative\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.  As for the dissent, it asserts that the statute cannot possibly have a natural and discernible meaning, since \xe2\x80\x9ccourts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMembers of this Court\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chave divided\xe2\x80\x9d over the question.  It was just weeks ago, however, that the author of the dissent, joined by the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court, concluded that a statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning was \xe2\x80\x9cplain,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rockwell Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 1) (Stevens, J., dissenting), even though the Courts of Appeals and Members of this Court divided over the question, <em>id.</em>, at <em>__, </em>n.\xc2\xa05<em> </em>(slip op., at 12, n.\xc2\xa05).  Was plain meaning then, as the dissent claims it is today, <em>post</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01, \xe2\x80\x9cin the eye of the beholder\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is unremarkable that various Justices in this case reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the statutory text.  It is remarkable, however, that the dissent believes that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how th[e] [strong-inference] standard should operate in practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  This is language usually employed to describe the discretion conferred upon administrative agencies, which need not adopt what courts would consider the interpretation most faithful to the text of the statute, but may choose some other interpretation, so long as it is within the bounds of the reasonable, and may later change to some <em>other </em>interpretation that is within the bounds of the reasonable.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984).  Courts, by contrast, <em>must </em>give the statute its single, most plausible, reading.  To describe this as an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cdelegated lawmaking authority\xe2\x80\x9d seems to me peculiar\xe2\x80\x94unless one believes in lawmakers who have no discretion.  Courts must apply judgment, to be sure.  But judgment is not discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if I agreed with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference,\xe2\x80\x9d I would not join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion because of its frequent indulgence in the last remaining legal fiction of the West: that the report of a single committee of a single House expresses the will of Congress.  The Court says, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99[s] purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto promote greater uniformity among the Circuits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 10, relying for that certitude upon the statement of managers accompanying a House Conference Committee Report whose text was never adopted by the House, much less by the Senate, and as far as we know was read by almost no one.  The Court is sure that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inten[ded] to strengthen existing pleading requirements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, because\xe2\x80\x94again\xe2\x80\x94the statement of managers said so.  I come to the same conclusion for the much safer reason that the law which Congress adopted (and which the Members of both Houses actually <em>voted </em>on) so indicates.  And had the legislation not done so, the statement\nof managers assuredly could not have remedied the\ndeficiency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the above exceptions, I am generally in agreement with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, and so concur in its judgment.  </p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cthe owner of the precious falcon would find the inference of guilt as to B quite strong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n. 5.

S. C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2).  I further agree that the case should be remanded to allow the lower courts to decide in the first instance whether the allegations survive under the correct standard.  In two respects, however, I disagree with the opinion of the Court.  First, the best interpretation of the statute is that only those facts that are alleged \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity\xe2\x80\x9d may properly be considered in determining whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient.  Second, I agree with Justice Scalia that a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter, in the present context, means an inference that is more likely than not correct.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the first point, the statutory language is quite clear.   Section 78u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2) states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9ca strong inference\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter must arise from those facts that are stated \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity.\xe2\x80\x9d  It follows that facts not stated with the requisite particularity cannot be considered in determining whether the strong-inference test is met.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In dicta, however, the Court states that \xe2\x80\x9comissions and ambiguities\xe2\x80\x9d merely \xe2\x80\x9ccount against\xe2\x80\x9d inferring scienter, and that a court should consider all allegations of scienter, even nonparticularized ones, when considering whether a complaint meets the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  <em>Ante,</em> at 14.  Not only does this interpretation contradict the clear statutory language on this point, but it undermines the particularity requirement\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of preventing a plaintiff from using vague or general allegations in order to get by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Allowing a plaintiff to derive benefit from such allegations would permit him to circumvent this important provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the particularity requirement in no way distinguishes it from normal pleading review, under which a court naturally gives less weight to allegations containing \xe2\x80\x9comissions and ambiguities\xe2\x80\x9d and more weight to allegations stating particularized facts.  The particularity requirement is thus stripped of all meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Questions certainly may arise as to whether certain allegations meet the statutory particularity requirement, but where that requirement is violated, the offending allegations cannot be taken into account.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would also hold that a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\xe2\x80\x9d is an inference that is stronger than the inference that the defendant lacked the required state of mind.  Congress has provided very little guidance regarding the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference,\xe2\x80\x9d and the difference between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation (the inference of scienter must be at least as strong as the inference of no scienter) and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s (the inference of scienter must be at least marginally stronger than the inference of no scienter) is unlikely to make any practical difference.  The two approaches are similar in that they both regard the critical question as posing a binary choice (either the facts give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d of scienter or they do not).  But Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would align the pleading test under \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2) with the test that is used at the summary-judgment and judgment-as-a-matter-of-law stages, whereas the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test would introduce a test previously unknown in civil litigation.  It seems more likely that Congress meant to adopt a known quantity and thus to adopt Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962479">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nTELLABS, INC.

It thus implicitly delegated significant lawmaking authority to the Judiciary in determining how that standard should operate in practice.  Today the majority crafts a perfectly workable definition of the term, but I am persuaded that a different interpretation would be both easier to apply and more consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic purpose of the heightened pleading requirement in the context of securities fraud litigation is to protect defendants from the costs of discovery and trial in unmeritorious cases.  Because of its intrusive nature, discovery may also invade the privacy interests of the defendants and their executives.  Like citizens suspected of having engaged in criminal activity, those defendants should not be required to produce their private effects unless there is probable cause to believe them guilty of misconduct.  Admittedly, the probable-cause standard is not capable of precise measurement, but it is a concept that is familiar to judges.  As a matter of normal English usage, its meaning is roughly the same as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, it is most unlikely that Congress intended us to adopt a standard that makes it more difficult to commence a civil case than a criminal case.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the benefit of its grounding in an already familiar legal concept, using a probable-cause standard would avoid the unnecessary conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cin determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a \xe2\x80\x98strong\xe2\x80\x99 inference of scienter, the court <em>must</em> take into account plausible opposing inferences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (emphasis added).  There are times when an inference can easily be deemed strong without any need to weigh competing inferences.  For example, if a known drug dealer exits a building immediately after a confirmed drug transaction, carrying a suspicious looking package, a judge could draw a strong inference that the individual was involved in the aforementioned drug transaction without debating whether the suspect might have been leaving the building at that exact time for another unrelated reason.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, using that same methodology, we assume (as we must, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, 14) the truth of the detailed factual allegations attributed to 27 different confidential informants described in the complaint, App. 91\xe2\x80\x9393, and view those allegations collectively, I think it clear that they establish probable cause to believe that Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 chief executive officer \xe2\x80\x9cacted with the required intent,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Seventh Circuit held.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  437 F.\xc2\xa03d 588, 602 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The meaning of a statute can only be determined on a case by case basis and will, in each case, turn differently on the clarity of the statutory language, its context, and the intent of its drafters.  Here, in my judgment, a probable-cause standard is more faithful to the intent of Congress, as expressed in both the specific pleading requirement and the statute as a whole, than the more defendant-friendly interpretation that Justice Scalia prefers.  He is clearly wrong in concluding that in divining the meaning of this term, we can merely \xe2\x80\x9cread the language for what it says,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it is susceptible to only one reading.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  He argues that we \xe2\x80\x9cmust be content to give \xe2\x80\x98strong inference\xe2\x80\x99 its normal meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and yet the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of a term such as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong inference\xe2\x80\x9d is surely in the eye of the beholder.  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion points out, Courts of Appeals have divided on the meaning of the standard, see <em>ante</em>, at 2, 10, and today, the Members of this Court have done the same.  Although Justice Scalia may disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the term, he should at least acknowledge that, in this case, the term itself is open to interpretation.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cchannel stuffing\xe2\x80\x9d allegations in \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 62\xe2\x80\x9372 of the amended complaint, App. 110\xe2\x80\x93113, are particularly persuasive.  Contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegations of channel stuffing \xe2\x80\x9care too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, this portion of the complaint clearly alleges that Notebaert himself had specific knowledge of illegitimate channel stuffing during the relevant time period.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 111, \xc2\xb667 (\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant Notebaert worked directly with Tellabs\xe2\x80\x99 sales personnel to channel stuff SBC\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 110\xe2\x80\x93112 (alleging, in describing such channel stuffing, that Tellabs took \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d steps that amounted to \xe2\x80\x9can abnormal practice in the industry\xe2\x80\x9d; that \xe2\x80\x9cdistributors were upset and later returned the inventory\xe2\x80\x9d (and, in the case of Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s Chairman, called Tellabs to complain); that customers \xe2\x80\x9cdid not want\xe2\x80\x9d products that Tellabs sent and that Tellabs employees wrote purchase orders for; that \xe2\x80\x9creturns were so heavy during January and February 2001 that Tellabs had to lease extra storage space to accommodate all the returns\xe2\x80\x9d; and that Tellabs \xe2\x80\x9cbackdat[ed] sales\xe2\x80\x9d that actually took place in 2001 to appear as having occurred in 2000).  If these allegations are actually taken as true and viewed in the collective, it is hard to imagine what competing inference could effectively counteract the inference that Notebaert and Tellabs \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98acted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (opinion of the Court) (quoting 15 U.
