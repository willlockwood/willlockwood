Their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d phones.

Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Concepcions claim that the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule is a ground that \xe2\x80\x9cexist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\xe2\x80\x9d under FAA \xc2\xa72.  When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule.  But the inquiry is more complex when a generally applicable doctrine is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes with arbitration.  Although \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  Cf. <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a>, 872.  The FAA\xe2\x80\x99s overarching purpose is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate informal, streamlined proceedings.  Parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration, <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U.

The switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices arbitration\xe2\x80\x99s informality and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.  And class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.  The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected.  That risk of error may become unacceptable when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are aggregated and decided at once.  Arbitration is poorly suited to these higher stakes.  In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification decision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710 limits the grounds on which courts can vacate arbitral awards.

We consider whether the FAA prohibits States from conditioning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide arbitration procedures.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion entered into an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular telephones with AT&amp;T Mobility LCC (AT&amp;T).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The contract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the parties, but required that claims be brought in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cindividual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert 61a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The agreement authorized AT&amp;T to make unilateral amendments, which it did to the arbitration provision on several occasions.  The version at issue in this case reflects revisions made in December 2006, which the parties agree are controlling.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The revised agreement provides that customers may initiate dispute proceedings by completing a one-page No-tice of Dispute form available on AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s Web site.  AT&amp;T may then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if \nthe dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer may invoke arbitration by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, also available on AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s Web site.  In the event the parties proceed to arbitration, the agreement specifies that AT&amp;T must pay all costs for nonfrivolous claims; that arbitration must take place in the county in which the customer is billed; that, for claims of $10,000 or less, the customer may choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions; that either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration; and that the arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and presumably punitive damages.  The agreement, moreover, denies AT&amp;T any ability to seek reimbursement of its attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and, in the event that a customer receives an arbitration award greater than AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s last written settlement offer, requires AT&amp;T to pay a $7,500 minimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Concepcions purchased AT&amp;T service, which was advertised as including the provision of free phones; they were not charged for the phones, but they were charged $30.22 in sales tax based on the phones\xe2\x80\x99 retail value.  In March 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against AT&amp;T in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The complaint was later consolidated with a putative class action alleging, among other things, that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2008, AT&amp;T moved to compel arbitration under the terms of its contract with the Concepcions.  The Concepcions opposed the motion, contending that the ar-bitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully exculpatory under California law because it disallowed classwide procedures.  The District Court denied AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  It described AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration agreement favorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute-resolution process was \xe2\x80\x9cquick, easy to use\xe2\x80\x9d and likely to \xe2\x80\x9cpromp[t] full or \xe2\x80\xa6 even excess payment to the customer <em>without</em> the need to arbitrate or litigate\xe2\x80\x9d; that the $7,500 premium functioned as \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial inducement for the consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d if a dispute was not resolved informally; and that consumers who were members of a class would likely be worse off.  <em>Laster </em>v. \n<em>T-Mobile USA, Inc.</em>, 2008 WL 5216255, *11\xe2\x80\x93*12 (SD Cal., Aug. 11, 2008).  Nevertheless, relying on the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Discover Bank</em> v. <em>Superior Court</em>, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100 (2005), the court found that the arbitration provision was unconscionable because AT&amp;T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions.  <em>Laster</em>, 2008 WL 5216255, *14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the provision unconscionable under California law as announced in <em>Discover Bank</em>.  <em>Laster</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC</em>, 584 F.\xc2\xa03d 849, 855 (2009).  It also held that the <em>Discover Bank</em> rule was not preempted by the FAA because that rule was simply \xe2\x80\x9ca refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in California.\xe2\x80\x9d  584 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 857.  In response to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Con-cepcions\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of California law discriminated against arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the contention that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and expeditiousness of arbitration\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>Discover</em> <em>Bank</em> placed arbitration agreements with class action waivers on the <em>exact same footing</em> as contracts that bar class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 858 (quoting <em>Shroyer</em> v. <em>New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc</em>., 498 F.\xc2\xa03d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 560 U.

In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U.

The question in this case is whether \xc2\xa72 preempts California\xe2\x80\x99s rule classifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable.  We refer to this rule as the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any contract found \xe2\x80\x9cto have been unconscionable at the time it was made,\xe2\x80\x9d or may \xe2\x80\x9climit the application of any unconscionable clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71670.5(a) (West 1985).  A finding of unconscionability requires \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98procedural\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98substantive\xe2\x80\x99 element, the former focusing on \xe2\x80\x98oppression\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98surprise\xe2\x80\x99 due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on \xe2\x80\x98overly harsh\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98one-sided\xe2\x80\x99 results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Armendariz</em> v. <em>Foundation Health Pyschcare Servs., Inc.</em>, 24 Cal. 4th 83, 114, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d 669, 690 (2000); accord, <em>Discover Bank</em>, 36 Cal. 4th, at 159\xe2\x80\x93161, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Discover Bank</em>, the California Supreme Court applied this framework to class-action waivers in arbitration agreements and held as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it is alleged that the party \nwith the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, then \xe2\x80\xa6 the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party \xe2\x80\x98from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another.\xe2\x80\x99 Under these circumstances, such waivers are unconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 162, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110 (quoting Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71668).</p>\n<p align="left">\nCalifornia courts have frequently applied this rule to find arbitration agreements unconscionable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>DirecTV, Inc</em>., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451\xe2\x80\x931453, 48 Cal.

Moreover, they argue that even if we construe the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule as a prohibition on collective-action waivers rather than simply an application of unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to all dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits waivers of class litigation as well.  See <em>America Online, Inc.</em> v. <em>Superior Ct.</em>, 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 699, 711\xe2\x80\x93713 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.  <em>Preston</em> v. <em>Ferrer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/346/index.html">552 U. S. 346</a>, 353 (2008).  But the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here, unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.  In <em>Perry</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/483/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/483/index.html">482 U. S. 483</a> (1987), for example, we noted that the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive effect might extend even to grounds traditionally thought to exist \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 492, n.\xc2\xa09 (emphasis deleted).  We said that a court may not \xe2\x80\x9crely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect what \xe2\x80\xa6 the state legislature cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 493, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An obvious illustration of this point would be a case finding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public policy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to provide for judicially monitored discovery.  The rationalizations for such a holding are neither difficult to imagine nor different in kind from those articulated in <em>Discover Bank.  </em>A court might reason that no consumer would knowingly waive his right to full discovery, as this would enable companies to hide their wrongdoing.  Or the court might simply say that such agreements are exculpatory\xe2\x80\x94re-stricting discovery would be of greater benefit to the \ncompany than the consumer, since the former is more likely to be sued than to sue.  See <em>Discover Bank</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 161, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1109 (arguing that class waivers are similarly one-sided).  And, the reasoning would continue, because such a rule applies the general principle of unconscionability or public-policy disapproval of exculpatory agreements, it is applicable to \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d contract and thus preserved by \xc2\xa72 of the FAA.  In practice, of course, the rule would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration agreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other examples are easy to imagine.  The same argument might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury (perhaps termed \xe2\x80\x9ca panel of twelve lay arbitrators\xe2\x80\x9d to help avoid preemption).  Such examples are not fanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in \xe2\x80\x9ca great variety\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cdevices and formulas\xe2\x80\x9d declaring arbitration against public policy.  <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc.</em>, 271 F.\xc2\xa02d 402, 406 (CA2 1959).  And although these statistics are not definitive, it is worth noting that California\xe2\x80\x99s courts have been more likely to hold contracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.

The concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe therefore are not persuaded by the argument that the conflict between two goals of the Arbitration Act\xe2\x80\x94enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution\xe2\x80\x94must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to realize the intent of the drafters.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.

They have repeatedly described the Act as \xe2\x80\x9cembod[ying] [a] national policy favoring arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckeye Check Cashing</em>, 546 U. S., at 443, and \xe2\x80\x9ca liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Moses H. Cone</em>, 460 U. S., at 24; see also <em>Hall Street Assocs.</em>, 552 U. S., at 581.  Thus, in <em>Preston</em> v. <em>Ferrer</em>, holding preempted a state-law rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before arbitration, we said: \xe2\x80\x9cA prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve \xe2\x80\x98streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which objective would be \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrated\xe2\x80\x9d by requiring a dispute to be heard by an agency first.  552 U. S., at 357\xe2\x80\x93358.  That rule, we said, would \xe2\x80\x9cat the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 358.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Discover Bank</em> rule similarly interferes with arbitration.  Although the rule does not <em>require</em> classwide arbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to demand it <em>ex post.</em>  The rule is limited to adhesion contracts, <em>Discover Bank</em>, 36 Cal. 4th, at 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110, but the times in which consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long past.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Carbajal</em> v. <em>H&amp;R Block Tax Servs., Inc</em>., 372 F.\xc2\xa03d 903, 906 (CA7 2004); see also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Gateway 2000, Inc.</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa03d 1147, 1149 (CA7 1997).  The rule also requires that damages be predictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers.  <em>Discover Bank</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110.  The former requirement, however, is toothless and malleable (the Ninth Circuit has held that damages of $4,000 are sufficiently small, see <em>Oestreicher </em>v. <em>Alienware Corp.</em>, 322 Fed. Appx. 489, 492 (2009) (unpublished)), and the latter has no limiting effect, as all that is required is an allegation.  Consumers remain free to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under <em>Discover Bank</em>, and some may well do so; but there is little incentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals when they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in the process.  And faced with inevitable class arbitration, companies would have less incentive to continue resolving potentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have had little occasion to examine classwide arbitration, our decision in <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>is instructive.  In that case we held that an arbitration panel exceeded its power under \xc2\xa710(a)(4) of the FAA by imposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration agreement itself or some background principle of contract law that would affect its interpretation.  559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9323).  We then held that the agreement at issue, which was silent on the question of class procedures, could not be interpreted to allow them because the \xe2\x80\x9cchanges brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 22).  This is obvious as a structural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent parties, necessitating additional and different procedures and involving higher stakes.  Confidentiality becomes more difficult.  And while it is theoretically possible to select an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the class-certification question, arbitrators are not generally knowledgeable in the often-dominant procedural aspects of certification, such as the protection of absent parties.  The conclusion follows that class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by <em>Discover Bank</em> rather than consensual, \nis inconsistent with the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration\xe2\x80\x94its informality\xe2\x80\x94and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  But before an arbitrator may decide the merits of a claim in classwide procedures, he must first decide, for example, whether the class itself may be certified, whether the named parties are sufficiently representative and typical, and how discovery for the class should be conducted.  A cursory comparison of bilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference.  According to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the average consumer arbitration between January and August 2007 resulted in a disposition on the merits in \nsix months, four months if the arbitration was conducted by documents only.  AAA, Analysis of the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s Con-sumer Arbitration Caseload, online at http://www.adr.org/\nsi.asp?id=5027 (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 25, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  As of September 2009, the AAA had opened 283 class arbitrations.  Of those, 121 remained active, and 162 had been settled, withdrawn, or dismissed.  Not a single one, however, had resulted in a final award on the merits.  Brief for AAA as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Stolt-Nielsen,</em> O.\xc2\xa0T. 2009, No. 08\xe2\x80\x931198, pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  For those cases that were no longer active, the median time from filing to settlement, withdrawal, or dismissal\xe2\x80\x94not judgment on the merits\xe2\x80\x94was 583 days, and the mean was 630 days.  <em>Id.</em>, at 24.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, class arbitration <em>requires</em> procedural formality.  The AAA\xe2\x80\x99s rules governing class arbitrations mimic the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for class litigation.  Compare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (effective Oct. 8, 2003), online at http://www.adr.org/\nsp.asp?id=21936, with Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023.  And while parties can alter those procedures by contract, an alternative is not obvious.  If procedures are too informal, absent class members would not be bound by the arbitration.  For a class-action money judgment to bind absentees in litigation, class representatives must at all times adequately represent absent class members, and absent members must be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and \na right to opt out of the class.  <em>Phillips Petroleum Co.</em> v. <em>Shutts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/797/index.html">472 U. S. 797</a>, 811\xe2\x80\x93812 (1985).  At least this amount of process would presumably be required for absent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find it unlikely that in passing the FAA Congress meant to leave the disposition of these procedural requirements to an arbitrator.  Indeed, class arbitration was not even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA in 1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in <em>Discover Bank</em>, class arbitration is a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively recent development.\xe2\x80\x9d  36 Cal. 4th, at 163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110.  And it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator would be entrusted with ensuring that third parties\xe2\x80\x99 due process rights are satisfied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.  Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected.  Defendants are willing to accept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their impact is limited to the size of individual disputes, and presumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the courts.  But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at once, the risk of an error will often become unacceptable.  Faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss, defendants will be pressured into settling questionable claims.  Other courts have noted the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cin terrorem\xe2\x80\x9d settlements that class actions entail, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kohen</em> v. <em>Pacific Inv. Management Co. LLC</em>, 571 F.\xc2\xa03d 672, 677\xe2\x80\x93678 (CA7 2009), and class arbitration would be no different.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class litigation.  In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification decision on an interlocutory basis and, if unsuccessful, may appeal from a final judgment as well.  Questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo</em> and questions of fact for clear error.  In contrast, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710 allows a court to vacate an arbitral award <em>only</em> where the award \xe2\x80\x9cwas procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cthere was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cthe arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing \xe2\x80\xa6 or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy[,] or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\xe2\x80\x9d; or if the \xe2\x80\x9carbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award \xe2\x80\xa6 was not made.\xe2\x80\x9d  The AAA rules do authorize judicial review of certification decisions, but this review is unlikely to have much effect given these limitations; review un-\nder \xc2\xa710 focuses on misconduct rather than mistake.  And parties may not contractually expand the grounds or nature of judicial review.  <em>Hall Street Assocs.</em>, 552 U. S., at 578.  We find it hard to believe that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Concepcions contend that because parties may and sometimes do agree to aggregation, class procedures are not necessarily incompatible with arbitration.  But the same could be said about procedures that the Concepcions admit States may not superimpose on arbitration: Parties <em>could</em> agree to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or pursuant to a discovery process rivaling that in litigation.  Arbitration is a matter of contract, and the FAA requires courts to honor parties\xe2\x80\x99 expectations.  <em>Rent-A-Center</em>, <em>West</em>, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  But what the parties in the aforementioned examples would have agreed to is not arbitration as envisioned by the FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be required by state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary to prosecute small-dollar claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system.  See <em>post</em>, at 9.  But States cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.  Moreover, the claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved.  As noted earlier, the arbitration agreement provides that AT&amp;T will pay claimants a minimum of $7,500 and twice their attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater than AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s last settlement offer.  The District Court found this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the individual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not immediately settled, and the Ninth Circuit admitted that aggrieved customers who filed claims would be \xe2\x80\x9cessentially guarantee[d]\xe2\x80\x9d to be made whole, 584 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 856, n. 9.  Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concepcions were <em>better off</em> under their arbitration agreement with AT&amp;T than they would have been as participants in \na class action, which \xe2\x80\x9ccould take months, if not years, \nand which may merely yield an opportunity to submit a claim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Laster</em>, 2008 WL 5216255, at *12.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because it \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U.

Such a limitation appears nowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our cases.  \xe2\x80\x9cRelationships between securities dealers and investors, for example, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] nevertheless held \xe2\x80\xa6 that agreements to arbitrate in that context are enforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a>, 33 (1991); see also <em>id.</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (allowing arbitration of claims arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 despite allegations of unequal bargaining power between employers and employees).  Of course the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s disquisition on legislative history fails to note that it contains nothing\xe2\x80\x94not even the testimony of a stray witness in committee hearings\xe2\x80\x94that contemplates the existence of class arbitration.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns that attend contracts of adhesion\xe2\x80\x94for example, requiring class-action-waiver provisions in adhesive arbitration agreements to be highlighted.  Such steps cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its purpose to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent claims that class arbitration should be compared to class litigation, not bilateral arbitration.  <em>Post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Whether arbitrating a class is more desirable than litigating one, however, is not relevant.  A State cannot defend a rule requiring arbitration-by-jury by saying that parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent cites three large arbitration awards (none of which stems from classwide arbitration) as evidence that parties are willing to submit large claims before an arbitrator.  <em>Post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Those examples might be in point if it could be established that the size of the arbitral dispute was predictable when the arbitration agreement was entered.  Otherwise, all the cases prove is that arbitrators can give huge awards\xe2\x80\x94which we have never doubted.  The point is that in class-action arbitration huge awards (with limited judicial review) will be entirely predictable, thus rendering arbitration unattractive.  It is not reasonably deniable that requiring consumer disputes to be arbitrated on a classwide basis will have a substantial deterrent effect on incentives to arbitrate.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963537">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nAT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  The question here is whether California\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Discover Bank </em>rule, see <em>Discover Bank</em> v. <em>Superior Ct.</em>, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100 (2005), is a \xe2\x80\x9cgroun[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be absurd to suggest that \xc2\xa72 requires only that a defense apply to \xe2\x80\x9cany contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  If \xc2\xa72 means anything,\nit is that courts cannot refuse to enforce arbitration agreements because of a state public policy against arbitration, even if the policy nominally applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  There must be some additional limit on the contract defenses permitted by \xc2\xa72.  Cf.<em> ante</em>, at 17 (opinion of the Court) (state law may not require procedures that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot arbitration as envisioned by the FAA\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clac[k] its benefits\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>post</em>, at 5 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (state law may require only procedures that are \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the use of arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I write separately to explain how I would find that limit in the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s text.  As I would read it, the FAA requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress.  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 4.  Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of Appeals because a district court cannot follow both the FAA and the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule, which does not relate to defects in the making of an agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading of the text, however, has not been fully developed by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41, n.\xc2\xa012, and could benefit from briefing and argument in an appropriate case.  Moreover, I think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test will often lead to the same outcome as my textual interpretation and that, when possible, it is important in interpreting statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority of the Court.  See <em>US Airways, Inc.</em> v. <em>Barnett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/391/index.html">535 U. S. 391</a>, 411 (2002) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  Therefore, although I adhere to my views on purposes-and-objectives pre-emption, see <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/555/index.html">555 U. S. 555</a>, ___ (2009) (opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FAA generally requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements as written.  Section 2 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] written provision in \xe2\x80\xa6 a contract \xe2\x80\xa6 to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  Significantly, the statute does not<em> </em>parallel the words \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\xe2\x80\x9d by referencing the grounds as exist for the \xe2\x80\x9cinvalidation, revocation, or nonenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of any contract.  Nor does the statute use a different word or phrase entirely that might arguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce-ability.  The use of only \xe2\x80\x9crevocation\xe2\x80\x9d and the conspicuous omission of \xe2\x80\x9cinvalidation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d suggest that the exception does not include all defenses applicable to any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.  See <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the one hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is not obvious.  The statute does not define the terms, and their ordinary meanings arguably overlap.  Indeed, this Court and others have referred to the concepts of revocability, validity, and enforceability interchangeably.  But this ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear decision in \xc2\xa72 to repeat only one of the three\nconcepts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To clarify the meaning of \xc2\xa72, it would be natural to look to other portions of the FAA.  Statutory interpretation focuses on \xe2\x80\x9cthe language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 341 (1997).  \xe2\x80\x9cA provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme \xe2\x80\xa6 because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  United Sav. Assn. of Tex.</em> v. <em>Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/365/index.html">484 U. S. 365</a>, 371 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Examining the broader statutory scheme, \xc2\xa74 can be read to clarify the scope of \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.  When a party seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement in federal court, \xc2\xa74 requires that \xe2\x80\x9cupon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,\xe2\x80\x9d the court must order arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the terms of the agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reading \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72 and 4 harmoniously, the \xe2\x80\x9cgrounds \xe2\x80\xa6 for the revocation\xe2\x80\x9d preserved in \xc2\xa72 would mean grounds related to the making of the agreement.  This would require enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party successfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of the agreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.  See <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em> v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html">388 U.

I think it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Discover Bank</em>, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100, the California Supreme Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cclass action waivers are, under certain circumstances, unconscionable as unlaw-fully exculpatory.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 65, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1112; see \nalso <em>id.</em>, at 161, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]lass action waivers [may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are contrary to public policy\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court concluded that where a class-action waiver is found in an arbitration agreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion, such waivers \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be enforced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110.  In practice, the court explained, such agreements \xe2\x80\x9coperate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise would be imposed under California law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 161, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108, 1109.  The court did not conclude that a customer would sign such an agreement only if under the influence of fraud, duress, or delusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and conclusion that the arbitration agreement was exculpatory reveals that the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule does not concern the making of the arbitration agreement.  Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex-ample of contracts that will not be enforced because of public policy.  15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa785.1, 85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003).  Indeed, the court explained that it would not enforce the agreements because they are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98against the policy of the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108 (quoting Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71668); see also 36 Cal. 4th, at 166, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1112 (\xe2\x80\x9cAgreements to arbitrate may not be used to harbor terms, conditions and practices that undermine public policy\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Refusal to enforce a contract for public-policy reasons does not concern whether the contract was properly made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule is not a \xe2\x80\x9cgroun[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 for the revocation of any contract\xe2\x80\x9d as I would read \xc2\xa72 of the FAA in light of \xc2\xa74.  Under this reading, the FAA dictates that the arbitration agreement here be enforced and the <em>Discover Bank</em> rule is pre-empted.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The interpretation I suggest would be consistent with our precedent.  Contract formation is based on the consent of the parties, and we have emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U.

This statement is found in a footnote concerning a claim that the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[d] to address.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 392, n.\xc2\xa09<em>.</em>  Similarly, to the extent that statements in <em>Rent-A-Center, West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n.\xc2\xa01), can be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses under \xc2\xa72, those statements are dicta, as well.  This Court has never addressed the question whether the state-law \xe2\x80\x9cgrounds\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in \xc2\xa72 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has acknowledged is applicable under \xc2\xa72 relates to contract formation.  In <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U.

Rather, that primary objective was to secure the \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of agreements to arbitrate.  <em>Dean Witter</em>, 470 U. S., at 221.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 219 (we \xe2\x80\x9creject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 219, 217\xe2\x80\x93218 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he intent of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d requires us to apply the terms of the Act without regard\nto whether the result would be \xe2\x80\x9cpossibly inefficient\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>id.</em>, at 220 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cexpedited resolution of disputes\xe2\x80\x9d might lead parties to prefer arbitration).

These claims are not well founded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes set aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids class arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule that would require \xe2\x80\x9cultimate disposition by a jury\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially monitored discovery\xe2\x80\x9d or use of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Federal Rules of Evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, 9.  Unlike the majority\xe2\x80\x99s examples, class arbitration is consistent with the use of arbitration.  It is a form of arbitration that is well known in California and followed elsewhere.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Keating</em> v. <em>Superior Ct</em>., 167 Cal. Rptr. 481, 492 (App. 1980) (officially depublished); American Arbitration Association (AAA), Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003), http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=21936 (as visited Apr. 25, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); JAMS, The Resolution Experts, Class Action Procedures (2009).  Indeed, the AAA has told us that it has found class ar-bitration to be \xe2\x80\x9ca fair, balanced, and efficient means of resolving class disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for AAA as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>AnimalFeeds Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em>, O. T. 2009, No. 08\xe2\x80\x931198, p.\xc2\xa025 (hereinafter AAA <em>Amicus</em> Brief).  And unlike the majority\xe2\x80\x99s examples, the <em>Discover Bank</em> rule imposes equivalent limitations on litigation; hence\nit cannot fairly be characterized as a targeted attack on arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where does the majority get its contrary idea\xe2\x80\x94that individual, rather than class, arbitration is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental attribut[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of arbitration?  <em>Ante, </em>at 9.  The majority does not explain.  And it is unlikely to be able to trace its present view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Congress enacted the Act, arbitration procedures had not yet been fully developed.  Insofar as Congress considered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well have thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact, not law, under the customs of their industries, where the parties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.  See <em>Mitsubishi Motors</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 646 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H.\xc2\xa0R. 646 before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1924); Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (1923); Dept. of Commerce, Secretary Hoover Favors Arbitration\xe2\x80\x94Press Release (Dec. 28, 1925), Herbert Hoover Papers\xe2\x80\x94Articles, Addresses, and Public Statements File\xe2\x80\x94No. 536, p.\xc2\xa02 (Herbert Hoover Presidential Library); Cohen &amp; Dayton, The New Federal<em> </em>Arbitration<em> </em>Law, 12 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 265, 281 (1926); AAA, Year Book on Commercial Arbitration in the United States (1927).  This last mentioned feature of the history\xe2\x80\x94roughly equivalent bargaining power\xe2\x80\x94suggests, if anything, that California\xe2\x80\x99s statute is consistent with, and indeed may help to further, the objectives that Congress had in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, if neither the history nor present practice suggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incompatible with arbitration itself, then on what basis can the majority hold California\xe2\x80\x99s law pre-empted?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule will discourage arbitration rests critically upon the wrong comparison.  The majority compares the complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral arbitration.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  And it finds the former more complex.  See <em>ibid</em>.  But, if incentives are at issue, the <em>relevant </em>comparison is not \xe2\x80\x9carbitration with arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d but a comparison between class arbitration and judicial class actions.  After all, in respect to the relevant set of contracts, the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule similarly and equally sets aside clauses that forbid class procedures\xe2\x80\x94whether arbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why would a typical defendant (say, a business) prefer a judicial class action to class arbitration?  AAA statistics \xe2\x80\x9csuggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time than the average commercial arbitration, but may take <em>less time</em> than the average class action in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  AAA <em>Amicus</em> Brief 24 (emphasis added).  Data from California courts confirm that class arbitrations can take considerably less time than in-court proceedings in which class certification is sought.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 14 (providing statistics for class arbitration), with Judicial Council of California, Administrative Office of the Courts, Class Certification in California: Second Interim Report from the Study of California Class Action Litigation 18 (2010) (providing statistics for class-action litigation in California courts).  And a single class proceeding is surely more efficient than thousands of separate proceedings for identical claims.  Thus, if speedy resolution of disputes were all that mattered, then the <em>Discover Bank </em>rule would reinforce, not obstruct, that objective of the Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s related claim that the <em>Discover Bank\n</em>rule will discourage the use of arbitration because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]rbitration is poorly suited to \xe2\x80\xa6 higher stakes\xe2\x80\x9d lacks empirical support.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Indeed, the majority provides no convincing reason to believe that parties are unwilling to submit high-stake disputes to arbitration.  And there are numerous counterexamples.  Loftus, Rivals Resolve Dispute Over Drug, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2011, p.\xc2\xa0B2 (discussing $500 million settlement in dispute submitted to arbitration); Ziobro, Kraft Seeks Arbitration In Fight With Starbucks Over Distribution, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 30, 2010, p.\xc2\xa0B10 (describing initiation of an arbitration in which the payout \xe2\x80\x9ccould be higher\xe2\x80\x9d than $1.5 billion); Markoff, Software Arbitration Ruling Gives I.B.M. $833 Million From Fujitsu, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Nov. 30, 1988, p. A1 (describing both companies as \xe2\x80\x9cpleased with the ruling\xe2\x80\x9d resolving a licensing dispute).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, even though contract defenses, <em>e.g.</em>, duress and unconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution process, federal arbitration law normally leaves such matters to the States.  <em>Rent-A-Center, West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (arbitration agreements \xe2\x80\x9cmay be invalidated by \xe2\x80\x98generally applicable contract defenses\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U. S. 681</a>, 687 (1996))).  A provision in a contract of adhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide very quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase the speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the State can forbid it.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hayes</em> v. <em>Oakridge Home</em>, 122 Ohio St. 3d 63, 67, 2009\xe2\x80\x93Ohio\xe2\x80\x932054, \xc2\xb619, 908 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 408, 412 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnconscionability is a ground for revocation of an arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Poly-America, L. P.</em>, 262 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 337, 348 (Tex. 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnconscionable contracts, however\xe2\x80\x94whether relating to arbitration or not\xe2\x80\x94are unenforceable under Texas law\xe2\x80\x9d).  The <em>Discover Bank </em>rule amounts to a variation on this theme.  California is free to define unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law is of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt a special rule that disfavors arbitration.  Cf. <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s As-sociates</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 687.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 4, n. (Thomas, J., concurring) (suggesting that, under certain circumstances, California might remain free to apply its unconscionability doctrine).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because California applies the same legal principles to address the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers as it does to address the unconscionability of any other contractual provision, the merits of class proceedings should not factor into our decision.  If California had applied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement, would it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement were efficient?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of class arbitrations, as it sees them.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatly increase[d] risks to defendants\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9cchance of a devastating loss\xe2\x80\x9d pressuring defendants \xe2\x80\x9cinto settling questionable claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  But class proceedings have countervailing advantages.  In general agreements that forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small-dollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to litigate.  I suspect that it is true even here, for as the Court of Appeals recognized, AT&amp;T can avoid the $7,500 payout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concepcions\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim\xe2\x80\x99s face value, such that \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum gain to a customer for the hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just $30.22.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Laster </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, </em>584 F.\xc2\xa03d 849, 855, 856 (CA9 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Carnegie</em> v. <em>Household Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>realistic</em> alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30\xe2\x80\x9d).  In California\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly rational view, nonclass arbitration over such sums will also sometimes have the effect of depriving claimants of their claims (say, for example, where claiming the $30.22 were to involve filling out many forms that require technical legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call is placed on hold).  <em>Discover Bank </em>sets forth circumstances in which the California courts believe that the terms of consumer contracts can be manipulated to insulate an agreement\xe2\x80\x99s author from liability for its own frauds by \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out\nof individually small sums of money.\xe2\x80\x9d  36 Cal. 4th, at\n162\xe2\x80\x93163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110.  Why is this kind of decision\xe2\x80\x94weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings alike\xe2\x80\x94not California\xe2\x80\x99s to make?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority can find no meaningful support for its views in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  The federal Act has been in force for nearly a century.  We have decided dozens of cases about its requirements.  We have reached results that authorize complex arbitration procedures. <em> E.g.,</em> <em>Mitsubishi Motors</em>, 473 U. S., at 629 (antitrust claims arising in international transaction are arbitrable).  We have upheld nondiscriminatory state laws that slow down arbitration proceedings.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Volt Information Sciences</em>, 489 U. S., at 477\xe2\x80\x93479 (California law staying arbitration proceedings until completion of related litigation is not pre-empted).  But we have not, to my knowledge, applied the Act to strike down a state statute that treats arbitrations on par with judicial and administrative proceedings.  Cf. <em>Preston</em>, 552 U. S., at 355\xe2\x80\x93356 (Act pre-empts state law that vests primary jurisdiction in state administrative board).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, we have repeatedly referred to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic objective as assuring that courts treat arbitration agreements \xe2\x80\x9clike all other contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U.
