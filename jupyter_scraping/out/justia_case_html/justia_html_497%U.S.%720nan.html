The sidewalk is the sole means by which customers may travel from the parking lot to the post office building and lies entirely on Postal Service property.  When respondents refused to leave the premises, they were arrested and subsequently convicted by a Federal Magistrate of violating, <em>inter alia,</em> 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1), which prohibits solicitation on postal premises.  The District Court affirmed the convictions.  It rejected respondents\' argument that \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1) violated the First Amendment, holding that the postal sidewalk was not a public forum and that the ban on solicitation is reasonable.  The Court of Appeals reversed.

The sidewalk was constructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business, not as a public passageway.  Nor has the Postal Service expressly dedicated its sidewalk to any expressive activity.  Postal property has only been dedicated to the posting of public notices on designated bulletin boards.  A practice of allowing individuals and groups to leaflet, speak, and picket on postal premises and a regulation prohibiting disruptive conduct do not add up to such dedication.  Even conceding that the forum has been dedicated to some First Amendment uses, and thus is not a purely nonpublic forum, regulation of the reserved nonpublic uses would still require application of the reasonableness test.

The categorical ban is based on the Service\'s long, real-world experience with solicitation, which has shown that, because of continual demands from a wide variety of groups, administering a program of permits and approvals had distracted postal facility managers from their primary jobs.  Whether or not the Service permits other forms of speech, it is not unreasonable for it to prohibit solicitation on the ground that it inherently disrupts business by impeding the normal flow of traffic.  <em>See Heffron v.

Confrontation by a person asking for money disrupts passage and is more intrusive and intimidating than an encounter with a person giving out information.  Even if more narrowly tailored regulations could be promulgated, the Service is only required to promulgate reasonable regulations, not the most reasonable or the only reasonable regulation possible.  Clearly, the regulation does not discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint.  The Service\'s concern about losing customers because of the potentially unpleasant situation created by solicitation <em>per se</em> does not reveal an effort to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.

We hold the regulation valid as applied.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The respondents in this case, Marsha B. Kokinda and Kevin E. Pearl, were volunteers for the National Democratic Policy Committee, who set up a table on the sidewalk near the entrance of the Bowie, Maryland, post office to solicit contributions, sell books and subscriptions to the organization\'s newspaper, and distribute literature addressing a variety of political issues.  The postal sidewalk provides the sole means by which customers of the post office may travel from the parking lot to the post office building, and lies entirely on Postal Service property.  The District Court for the District of Maryland described the layout of the post office as follows:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Bowie post office is a freestanding building, with its own sidewalk and parking lot.  It is located on a major highway, Route 197.  A sidewalk runs along the edge of the highway, separating the post office property from the street.  To enter the post office, cars enter a driveway that traverses the public sidewalk and enter a parking lot that surrounds the post office building.  Another sidewalk runs adjacent to the building itself, separating the parking lot from the building.  Postal patrons must use the sidewalk to enter the post office.  The sidewalk belongs to the post office and is used for no other purpose."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.</p>\n<p>During the several hours that respondents were at the post office, postal employees received between 40 and 50 complaints regarding their presence.  The record does not indicate the substance of the complaints, with one exception.  One individual complained "because she knew the Girl Scouts were not allowed to sell cookies on federal property."  866 F.2d 699, 705 (CA4 1989).  The Bowie postmaster asked respondents to leave, which they refused to do.  Postal inspectors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 497 U. S. 724</a></p><p> arrested respondents, seizing their table as well as their literature and other belongings.</p>\n<p>Respondents were tried before a United States Magistrate in the District of Maryland and convicted of violating 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1) (1989), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"Soliciting alms and contributions, campaigning for election to any public office, collecting private debts, commercial soliciting and vending, and displaying or distributing commercial advertising on postal premises are prohibited."</p>\n<p>Respondent Kokinda was fined $50 and sentenced to 10 days\' imprisonment; respondent Pearl was fined $100 and received a 30-day suspended sentence under that provision.</p>\n<p>Respondents appealed their convictions to the District Court, asserting that application of \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1) violated the First Amendment.  The District Court affirmed their convictions, holding that the postal sidewalk was not a public forum and that the Postal Service\'s ban on solicitation is reasonable.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  866 F.2d 699 (1989).  The Court of Appeals held that the postal sidewalk is a traditional public forum and analyzed the regulation as a time, place, and manner regulation.  The Court determined that the Government has no significant interest in banning solicitation, and that the regulation is not narrowly tailored to accomplish the asserted governmental interest.</p>\n<p>Respondents\' petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc were denied.

The municipal sidewalk that runs parallel to the road in this case is a public passageway.  The Postal Service\'s sidewalk is not such a thoroughfare.

The postal sidewalk was constructed solely to assist postal patrons to negotiate the space between the parking lot and the front door of the post office, not to facilitate the daily commerce and life of the neighborhood or city.  The dissent would designate all sidewalks open to the public as public fora.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#745">497 U.

Sidewalks, of course, are among those areas of public property that traditionally have been held open to the public for expressive activities, and are clearly within those areas of public property that may be considered, generally without further inquiry, to be public forum property.  In this respect, the present case differs from <em>Greer v. Spock.</em> . . .  In <em>Greer,</em> the streets and sidewalks at issue were located within an enclosed military reservation, Fort Dix, N.J., and were thus separated from the streets and sidewalks of any municipality.

Civilians are welcome to visit soldiers, and are welcome to visit the Fort as tourists.  They eat at the base and freely talk with recruits in unrestricted areas.  Public service buses, carrying both civilian and military passengers, regularly serve the base.  A 1970 traffic survey indicated that 66,000 civilian and military vehicles per day entered and exited the Fort.

Indeed, postal property is expressly dedicated to only one means of communication:  the posting of public notices on designated bulletin boards.  <em>See</em> 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(<em>o</em>) (1989).  No postal service regulation opens postal sidewalks to any First Amendment activity.  To be sure, individuals or groups have been permitted to leaflet, speak, and picket on postal premises, <em>see</em> Reply Brief for United States 12; 43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978), but a regulation prohibiting disruption, 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232(1)(e) (1989), and a practice of allowing some speech activities on postal property do not add up to the dedication of postal property to speech activities.

S. 731</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The history of regulation of solicitation in post offices demonstrates the reasonableness of the provision here at issue.  The Postal Service has been regulating solicitation at least since 1958.  Before enactment of the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, Pub.L. 91-375, 84 Stat. 720, 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 201 <em>et seq.,</em> the Post Office Department\'s internal guidelines "strictly prohibited" the</p>\n<p>"[s]oliciting [of] subscriptions, canvassing for the sale of any article, or making collections . . . in buildings operated by the Post Office Department, or on the grounds or sidewalks within the lot lines"</p>\n<p>of postal premises.  Postal Service Manual, Facilities Transmittal Letter 8, Buildings Operation:  Buildings Operated by the Post Office Department \xc2\xa7 622.8 (July 1958).  The Service prohibited all forms of solicitation until 1963, at which time it created an exception to its categorical ban on solicitation to enable certain "established national health, welfare, and veterans\' organizations" to conduct fund drives "at or within" postal premises with the local postmaster\'s permission, and at his discretion.  <em>See</em> Facilities Transmittal Letter 53, Buildings Operation:  Buildings Operated by the Post Office Department \xc2\xa7 622.8 (July 1963).  The general prohibition on solicitation was enlarged in 1972 to include "[s]oliciting alms and contributions or collecting private debts on postal premises."  37 Fed.Reg. 24347 (1972), <em>codified at</em> 39 CFR 232.6(h)(1) (1973).</p>\n<p>Soon after the 1972 amendment to the regulation, the Service expanded the exemption to encompass "[n]ational organizations which are wholly nonprofit in nature and which are devoted to charitable or philanthropic purposes" and "[l]ocal charitable and other nonprofit organizations," 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.6(h)(2), (3) (1974), and to permit these organizations to</p>\n<p>"request use of lobby space for annual or special fund-raising campaigns, providing they do not interfere with the transaction of postal business or require expenditures by the Postal Services or the use of its employees or equipment. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="732">Page 497 U. S. 732</a></p><p></p>\n<p>38 Fed.Reg. 27824-27825 (1973), <em>codified at</em> 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.16(h)(2) (1974).  Finally, in 1978, the Service promulgated the regulation at issue here.  After 15 years of providing various exceptions to its rule against solicitation, the Service concluded that a categorical ban on solicitation was necessary because the</p>\n<p>"Postal Service lacks the resources to enforce such regulation in the tens of thousands of post offices throughout the nation.  In addition, such regulation would be, of necessity, so restrictive as to be tantamount to prohibition, and so complex as to be unadministrable."</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978).</p>\n<p>"[C]onsideration of a forum\'s special attributes is relevant to the constitutionality of a regulation, since the significance of the governmental interest must be assessed in light of the characteristic nature and function of the particular forum involved."</p>\n<p><em>Heffron, supra,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/640/case.html#650">452 U. S. 650</a></span>-651.  The purpose of the forum in this case is to accomplish the most efficient and effective postal delivery system.  <em>See</em> 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 403(a); \xc2\xa7 403(b)(1); H.R.Rep. No. 91-1104, pp. 1, 5, 11-12, 17, 19 (1970) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 3649.  Congress has made clear that "it wished.the Postal Service to be run more like a business than had its predecessor, the Post Office Department."  <em>Franchise Tax Board of California v. United States Postal Service,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/512/case.html">467 U. S. 512</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/512/case.html#519">467 U. S. 519</a></span>-520, and n. 13 (1984).  Congress has directed the Service to become a self-sustaining service industry and to "seek out the needs and desires of its present and potential customers -- the American public" and to provide services in a manner "responsive" to the "needs of the American people."  H.R.Rep. No. 91-1104, <em>supra,</em> at 19-20.  The Postal Service has been entrusted with this mission at a time when the mail service market is becoming much more competitive.  It is with this mission in mind that we must examine the regulation at issue.</p>\n<p>The Government asserts that it is reasonable to restrict access of postal premises to solicitation, because solicitation is inherently disruptive of the postal service\'s business.  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 497 U. S. 733</a></p><p> agree.</p>\n<p>"Since the act of soliciting alms or contributions usually has as its objective an immediate act of charity, it has the potentiality for evoking highly personal and subjective reactions.  Reflection usually is not encouraged, and the person solicited often must make a hasty decision whether to share his resources with an unfamiliar organization while under the eager gaze of the solicitor."</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978).</p>\n<p>The dissent avoids determining whether the sidewalk is a public forum because it believes the regulation, 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(h) (1989), does not pass muster even under the reasonableness standard applicable to nonpublic fora.  In concluding that \xc2\xa7 232.1(h) is unreasonable, the dissent relies heavily on the fact that the Service permits other types of potentially disruptive speech on a case-by-case basis.  The dissent\'s criticism in this regard seems to be that solicitation is not receiving the same treatment by the Postal Service that other forms of speech receive.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#760">497 U. S. 760</a></span> (criticizing "inconsistent treatment").  That claim, however, is more properly addressed under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  In any event, it is anomalous that the Service\'s allowance of some avenues of speech would be relied upon as evidence that it is impermissibly suppressing other speech.  If anything, the Service\'s generous accommodation of some types of speech testifies to its willingness to provide as broad a forum as possible, consistent with its postal mission.  The dissent would create, in the name of the First Amendment, a disincentive for the Government to dedicate its property to any speech activities at all.  In the end, its approach permits it to sidestep the single issue before us:  Is the Government\'s prohibition of <em>solicitation</em> on postal sidewalks <em>unreasonable?</em></p>\n<p>Whether or not the Service permits other forms of speech, which may or may not be disruptive, it is not unreasonable to prohibit solicitation on the ground that it is unquestionably a particular form of speech that is disruptive of business.  Solicitation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="734">Page 497 U. S. 734</a></p><p> impedes the normal flow of traffic.  <em>See Heffron,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/640/case.html#653">452 U. S. 653</a></span>.  Solicitation requires action by those who would respond:  the individual solicited must decide whether or not to contribute (which itself might involve reading the solicitor\'s literature or hearing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for a wallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a credit card.  <em>See</em> Record, Exh. 5 (credit card receipt); <em>see also United States v. Belsky,</em> 799 F.2d 1485 (CA11 1986) ("Soliciting funds is an inherently more intrusive and complicated activity than is distributing literature").  As residents of metropolitan areas know from daily experience, confrontation by a person asking for money disrupts passage and is more intrusive and intimidating than an encounter with a person giving out information.  One need not ponder the contents of a leaflet or pamphlet in order mechanically to take it out of someone\'s hand, but one must listen, comprehend, decide and act in order to respond to a solicitation.  Solicitors can achieve their goal only by "stopping [passersby] momentarily or for longer periods as money is given or exchanged for literature" or other items.  <em>Heffron, supra,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/640/case.html#653">452 U. S. 653</a></span> (upholding stringent restrictions on the location of sales and solicitation activity).  Justice BLACKMUN noted this distinction in his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part to <em>Heffron:</em></p>\n<p>"The distribution of literature does not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to convey; instead, the recipient is free to read the message at a later time. . . .  [S]ales and the collection of solicited funds not only require the fair-goer to stop, but also engender additional confusion . . . because they involve acts of exchanging articles for money, fumbling for and dropping money, making change, etc."</p>\n<p>452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/640/case.html#665">452 U. S. 665</a></span> (citation omitted).  This description of the disruption and delay caused by solicitation rings of "common-sense," <em>ibid.,</em> which is sufficient </p><p><a class="page-number" name="735">Page 497 U. S. 735</a></p><p> in this Court to uphold a regulation under reasonableness review.</p>\n<p>The Postal Service\'s judgment is based on its long experience with solicitation.  It has learned from this experience that, because of a continual demand from a wide range of groups for permission to conduct fund-raising or vending on postal premises, postal facility managers were distracted from their primary jobs by the need to expend considerable time and energy fielding competing demands for space and administering a program of permits and approvals.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 ("The Postal Service concluded after an experience with limited solicitation that there wasn\'t enough room for everybody who wanted to solicit on postal property and further concluded that allowing limited solicitation carried with it more problems than it was worth").  Thus, the Service found that "even the limited activities permitted by [its] program . . . produced highly unsatisfactory results."  42 Fed.Reg. 63911 (1977).  It is on the basis of this real-world experience that the Postal Service enacted the regulation at issue in this case.  The Service also enacted regulations barring deposit or display of written materials except on authorized bulletin boards</p>\n<p>"to regain space for the effective display of postal materials and the efficient transaction of postal business, eliminate safety hazards, reduce maintenance costs, and improve the appearance of exterior and public-use areas on postal premises."</p>\n<p>43 Fed. Reg. 38824 (1978); <em>see</em> 39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(<em>o</em>) (1989).  In short, the Postal Service has prohibited the use of its property and resources where the intrusion creates significant interference with Congress\' mandate to ensure the most effective and efficient distribution of the mails.   This is hardly unreasonable.</p>\n<p>The dissent concludes that the Service\'s administrative concerns are unreasonable, largely because of the existence of less restrictive alternatives to the regulations at issue.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#761">497 U. S. 761</a></span>-763.  Even if more narrowly tailored regulations could be promulgated, however, the Postal Service is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="736">Page 497 U. S. 736</a></p><p> only required to adopt <em>reasonable</em> regulations, not "the most reasonable or the only reasonable" regulation possible.  <em>Cornelius,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#808">473 U. S. 808</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The dissent also would strike the regulation on the ground that the Postal Service enacted it because solicitation "would be likely to produce hostile reactions and to cause people to avoid post offices."  43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978).  The dissent reads into the Postal Service\'s realistic concern with losing postal business because of the uncomfortable atmosphere created by aggressive solicitation an intent to suppress certain views.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#754">497 U. S. 754</a></span>.  But the Postal Service has never intimated that it intends to suppress the views of any "disfavored or unpopular political advocacy group."  <em>Ibid.</em>  It is the inherent nature of solicitation itself, a content-neutral ground, that the Service justifiably relies upon when it concludes that solicitation is disruptive of its business.  The regulation is premised on the Service\'s long experience, on the fact that solicitation is inherently more disruptive than the other speech activities it permits, and on the Service\'s empirically based conclusion that a case-by-case approach to regulation of solicitation is unworkable.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the regulation does not discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint.  Indeed,</p>\n<p>"[n]othing suggests the Postal Service intended to discourage one viewpoint and advance another. . . .  By excluding all . . . groups from engaging in [solicitation], the Postal Service is not granting to \'one side of a debatable public question . . . a monopoly in expressing its views.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Monterey County Democratic Central Committee v. United States Postal Service,</em> 812 F.2d 1194, 1198-1199 (CA9 1987) (citation omitted).  The Service\'s concern about losing customers because of the potentially unpleasant situation created by solicitation <em>per se</em> does not reveal "an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\'s view."  <em>Perry,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/case.html#45">460 U. S. 45</a></span>-46. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 497 U. S. 737</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is clear that this regulation passes constitutional muster under the Court\'s usual test for reasonableness.  <em>See Lehman,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/298/case.html#303">418 U.

Accordingly, we conclude, as have the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Eleventh Circuits, that the Postal Service\'s regulation of solicitation is reasonable as applied.  <em>See United States v. Belsky,</em> 799 F.2d 1485 (CA11 1986); <em>United States v. Bjerke,</em> 796 F.2d 643 (CA3 1986).</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court of appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree that the postal regulation reviewed here does not violate the First Amendment.  Because my analysis differs in essential respects from that in Justice O\'CONNOR\'s opinion, a separate statement of my views is required.</p>\n<p>Many of those who use postal facilities do so from necessity, not choice.  They must go to a post office to conduct their business and personal correspondence, carrying cash for stamps or money orders.  While it is legitimate for the Postal Service to ensure convenient and unimpeded access for postal patrons, the public\'s use of postal property for communicative purposes means that the surrounding walkways may be an appropriate place for the exercise of vital rights of expression.  As society becomes more insular in character, it becomes essential to protect public places where traditional modes of speech and forms of expression can take place.  It is true that the uses of the adjacent public buildings and the needs of its patrons are an important part of a balance, but there remains a powerful argument that, because of the wide range of activities that the Government permits to take place on this postal sidewalk, it is more than a nonpublic forum.</p>\n<p>This is so even though the Government may intend to impose some limitations on the forum\'s use.  If our public forum jurisprudence is to retain vitality, we must recognize that certain objective characteristics of Government property and its customary use by the public may control the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 497 U. S. 738</a></p><p> case.  <em>See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html">473 U. S. 788</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#819">473 U. S. 819</a></span>-820 (1985) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting).  While it is proper to weigh the need to maintain the dignity and purpose of a public building, <em>see United States v. Grace,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/case.html">461 U. S. 171</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/case.html#182">461 U.

S. 39</a></span> (1966), other factors may point to the conclusion that the Government must permit wider access to the forum than it has otherwise intended.  Viewed in this light, the demand for recognition of heightened First Amendment protection has more force here than in those instances where the Government created a nontraditional forum to accommodate speech for a special purpose, as was thought true with teachers\' mail boxes in <em>Perry Education Assn. v.

Our decisions in recent years have identified three categories of forums in which expression might take place on government property:  (1) traditional, "quintessential public forums" -- "places which, by long tradition or by government fiat, have been devoted to assembly and debate," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 497 U.

"[S]treets, sidewalks, and parks, are considered, without more, to be <em>public forums.\'"\n</em></p>\n<p>"Traditional public forum property occupies a special position in terms of First Amendment protection, and will not lose its historically recognized character for the reason that it abuts government property that has been dedicated to a use other than as a forum for public expression."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

It is only common sense that a public sidewalk adjacent to a public building to which citizens are freely admitted is a natural location for speech to occur, whether that speech is critical of government generally, aimed at the particular governmental agency housed in the building, or focused upon issues unrelated to the government.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 497 U.

Public parks, streets, and sidewalks are public forums because open access by all members of the public is integral to their function as central gathering places and arteries of transportation.  Public access is not a matter of grace by government officials, but rather is inherent in the open nature of the locations.  As a result, expressive activity is compatible with the normal use of a public forum, and can be accommodated simply by applying the communication-neutral rules used to regulate other, nonspeech-related conduct on the premises.  <em>See Grayned v.

S. 727</a></span>.  It is irrelevant that the sidewalk at issue may have been constructed only to provide access to the Bowie Post Office.  Public sidewalks, parks, and streets have been reserved for public use as forums for speech even though government has not constructed them for expressive purposes.  Parks are usually constructed to beautify a city and to provide opportunities for recreation, rather than to afford a forum for soapbox orators or leafleteers; streets are built to facilitate transportation, not to enable protesters to conduct marches; and sidewalks are created with pedestrians in mind, not solicitors.  Hence, <em>why</em> the sidewalk was built is not salient.</p>\n<p>Nor is it important that the sidewalk runs only between the parking lot and post office entrance.  The existence of a public forum does not turn on a particularized factual inquiry into whether a sidewalk serves one building or many, or whether a street is a dead-end or a major thoroughfare.  In <em>Boos v. Barry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html">485 U.

Rather, that the walkway at issue is a sidewalk open and accessible to the general public is alone sufficient to identify it as a public forum.  As the Court of Appeals observed,</p>\n<p>"[i]t ill-behooves us to undertake too intricate a task of designation, holding this sidewalk public and that one not. . . .

The plurality\'s conclusion is unsound.</p>\n<p>The plurality has collapsed the distinction between exclusions that help define the contours of the forum and those that are imposed <em>after</em> the forum is defined.  Because the plurality finds that the prohibition on solicitation is part of the definition of the forum, it does not view the regulation as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 497 U.

The plurality\'s approach highlights the fact that there is only a semantic distinction between the two ways in which exclusions from a limited-purpose forum can be characterized, although the two options carry with them different standards of review.  The plurality\'s logic, as Justice BLACKMUN has noted in a previous case, would make restrictions on access to limited public forums self-justifying:</p>\n<p>"The Court makes it virtually impossible to prove that a forum restricted to a particular class of speakers is a limited public forum.  If the Government does not create a limited public forum unless it intends to provide an \'open forum\' for expressive activity, and if the exclusion of some speakers is evidence that the Government did not intend to create such a forum, . . . no speaker challenging denial of access will ever be able to prove that the forum is a limited public forum.  The very fact that the Government denied access to the speaker indicates that the Government did not intend to provide an open forum for expressive activity, and, under the Court\'s analysis, that fact alone would demonstrate that the forum is not a limited public forum."</p>\n<p><em>Cornelius,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#825">473 U.

Although I agree that the Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="753">Page 497 U.

The Court of Appeals found:</p>\n<p>"The record in this case reveals no evidence of a significant governmental interest best served by the ban on solicitation in a public forum.  There is no evidence that Kokinda and Pearl\'s solicitation obstructed or impeded postal customers.  [Respondents] were not charged with obstructing post office entrances, disturbing postal employees in the performance of their duties, or impeding the public in the transaction of postal business.  There is nothing to suggest that they harassed, threatened, or physically detained unwilling listeners."</p>\n<p>866 F.2d, at 704 (Citation omitted).  I agree with the Court of Appeals that the postal regulation is invalid as applied in this case because it</p>\n<p>"prohibits all solicitation anywhere on postal service property.  It sweeps an entire category of expressive activity off a public forum solely in the interest of administrative convenience.  It does not attempt to limit nondisruptive solicitation to a time, place, and manner consistent with post office operations; and it does not require that evidence of disruption be shown."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 705-706.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY contends that the postal regulation may be upheld as a content-neutral time, place, or manner regulation.  But the regulation is not content-neutral; indeed, it is tied explicitly to the content of speech.  If a person on postal premises says to members of the public, "Please support my political advocacy group," he cannot be punished.  If he says, "Please contribute $10," he is subject to criminal prosecution.  His punishment depends entirely on what he says.</p>\n<p>The plurality suggests that the regulation is not based on the content of speech, regardless of the terms of the restriction, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 497 U. S. 754</a></p><p> because the proffered governmental <em>interest</em> is unrelated to the communicative impact of expression.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#736">497 U. S. 736</a></span> (discussing "[t]he Service\'s concern about losing customers because of the potentially unpleasant situation created by solicitation").  This reasoning is flawed.  Any restriction on speech the application of which turns on the substance of the speech is content-based, no matter what the Government\'s interest may be.  <em>See Boos,</em> 485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html#335">485 U. S. 335</a></span>-338 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In any event, the government interest in this case is related to the suppression of expression, because the evil at which the postal regulation is aimed -- by the admission of both the Postal Service, <em>see</em> 43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978), and the plurality, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#736">497 U. S. 736</a></span> -- is the danger that solicitors might annoy postal customers and discourage them from patronizing postal offices.  But solicitors do not purportedly irk customers by speaking unusually loudly or uncomfortabiy close to their subjects.  Rather, the fear is that solicitation is bothersome because of its <em>content:</em>  The Post Office is concerned that being asked for money may be embarrassing or annoying to some people, particularly when the speaker is a member of a disfavored or unpopular political advocacy group.  For example, the Government makes much of the 40 or 50 customer complaints received at the Bowie Post Office while respondents solicited the public.  <em>See</em> Brief for United States 35-36, and n. 11.  But the record does not demonstrate that the complaints related to any difficulty in obtaining access to the post office.</p>\n<p>"For all we know, the complaints may have been generated by the hearers\' disagreement with the message of the National Democratic Policy Committee or their disapproval of the appearance or affiliation of the speakers."</p>\n<p>866 F.2d, at 705.  Although the Service\'s paternalism may be well-intended, it is axiomatic that a listener\'s reaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for regulation.  <em>Cf. United States v.

S. 45</a></span>, to the Government\'s interest in avoiding disruption.  Rather, the regulation is based on the Postal Service\'s generalized judgment that solicitation is more likely to be disruptive than are other types of speech.  The postal regulation is a "time, place, or manner" rule only in the novel sense that it permits no <em>manner</em> of solicitation at any <em>time</em> or at any <em>place</em> in the forum. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It is conceivable that, in some instances, solicitation might cause a crowd to form and block a post office entrance because an individual who decides to respond must "reach for a wallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a credit card," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#734">497 U. S. 734</a></span>, but the Postal Service has failed to document that this in fact has ever occurred, let alone that it would be more than an occasional problem.  The record in the instant case demonstrates that solicitation certainly does not invariably disrupt postal functions.  The plurality\'s trumpeting of Postal Service "real-world experience" as a valid basis for the regulation, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#735">497 U.

S. 756</a></p><p> experience is limited to solicitation in <em>postal lobbies.</em>   The Postal Service has never found solicitation on <em>exterior</em> sidewalks to pose a danger to postal operations. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>When government seeks to prohibit categorically an entire class of expression, it bears, at the very least, a heavy burden of justification.  <em>See Schad v.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  I find that the Postal Service has not met this burden, and that the postal regulation prohibiting an entire category of expression based on a broad assessment of its likely effects cannot qualify as a valid time, place, or manner regulation because such a prohibition "burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\'s legitimate interests."  <em>Ward v.

S. 758</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>In short, the Postal Service has made no attempt to justify its complete exclusion of solicitation from all locations on postal property, including exterior sidewalks.  The plurality\'s conclusion that a complete ban on solicitation is warranted rests on speculation regarding the possibility of disruption that is both inappropriate and unsupported.  As I have commented previously,</p>\n<p>"[n]o doubt a plausible argument could be made that the political gatherings of some parties are more likely than others to attract large crowds, causing congestion, that picketing for certain causes is more likely than other picketing to cause visual clutter, or that speakers delivering a particular message are more likely than others to attract an unruly audience. . . .  [But] governments [must] regulate based on actual congestion, visual clutter, or violence, rather than based on predictions that speech with a certain content will induce these effects."</p>\n<p><em>Boos v. Barry,</em> 485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/case.html#335">485 U. S. 335</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The First Amendment demands that the Postal Service prohibit solicitation only when it actually threatens legitimate government interests; "[b]road prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect. . . .  Precision of regulation must be the touchstone."  <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#438">371 U. S. 438</a></span> (1963).</p>\n<p>Indeed, a great irony of this case is that the Postal Service has already promulgated legitimate time, place, and manner regulations that fully protect its interests in preventing disruption of postal operations.  The postal regulations governing conduct on postal premises are codified in Part 232 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Conduct on Postal Property).  Postal Service rules prohibit individuals from obstructing post office entrances, disturbing postal employees in the performance of their duties, or impeding the public in the transaction of postal business.  Section 232.1(e), for example, provides that:</p>\n<p>"Disorderly conduct, or conduct which creates loud and unusual noise, or which obstructs the usual use of entrances, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 497 U. S. 759</a></p><p> foyers, corridors, offices, elevators, stairways, and parking lots, or which otherwise tends to impede or disturb the public employees in the performance of their duties, or which otherwise impedes or disturbs the general public in transacting business or obtaining the services provided on property, is prohibited."</p>\n<p>39 CFR \xc2\xa7 232.1(e) (1989).  Similarly, \xc2\xa7 232.1(k)(2) forbids "[t]he blocking of entrances, driveways, walks, loading platforms, or fire hydrants in or on [postal] property."  <em>See also</em> \xc2\xa7 232.1(c) (prohibition on "creating any hazard to persons or things").  Thus, although the postal regulation at issue here -- \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1) -- bans solicitation altogether, postal regulations restrict other forms of expression only when they actually disrupt postal operations.  There is no reason why the rules prohibiting disruptive conduct cannot be used to address the governmental interest in this case, and hence there is no need for a categorical exclusion of solicitation from sidewalks on postal property.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if I did not believe that the sidewalk outside the Bowie Post Office was a public forum, I nevertheless could not agree with the plurality that the postal regulation at issue today is reasonable as applied to respondents.  The Postal Service does not subject to the same categorical prohibition many other types of speech presenting the same risk of disruption as solicitation, such as soapbox oratory, pamphleteering, distributing literature for free, or even flag-burning. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  A solicitor who asks for funds and offers literature for sale outside the entrance to a post office is no more likely to block access than is a leafleteer who stands in the same place or a speaker who sets up his soapbox there.  In fact, solicitors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 497 U. S. 760</a></p><p> may be quite unlikely to attract much of an audience, because public requests for money are often ignored.  Certainly, solicitors are less likely to draw a crowd, and thus to disrupt postal functions, than are eloquent orators or persons distributing popular magazines for free.  Under the regulation, a group may stage a political rally to call attention to the problem of drug abuse [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and draw hundreds or even thousands of persons to the area just outside the entrance to the post office, because there is no general prohibition on large gatherings on postal premises. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  But since there is a categorical ban on solicitation, the group would be unable to ask a single member of the public for a contribution to advance its cause.</p>\n<p>This inconsistent treatment renders the prohibition on solicitation unreasonable.  The Postal Service undeniably has a legitimate interest in avoiding disruption of its postal facilities and ensuring that its buildings remain accessible to the public.  But the Government interest in preventing disruption of post office business or harassment of postal patrons is addressed by the direct prohibitions on such conduct in existing postal rules, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html#758">497 U. S. 758</a></span>-759, and the Service has not explained satisfactorily why these provisions are inadequate to deal with any disruption caused by solicitation.</p>\n<p>The plurality suggests that the irksome nature of solicitation supports the reasonableness of the postal regulation.  Even were the Postal Service\'s desire to prevent the annoyance of customers a legitimate basis for regulation, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] such an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 497 U. S. 761</a></p><p> interest could not justify the blanket ban on solicitation alone.  Many expressive activities permitted by \xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1) likely would trigger the same reactions in the audience.  Pamphleteers might distribute embarrassing or disturbing handbills, and soapbox orators might shout caustic invectives at postal patrons as they walk past, yet those activities are not subject to a categorical prohibition.  Indeed, the Postal Service permits other types of speech that demand an immediate response from the listener, such as inviting passers-by to sign a petition to place an initiative proposal on the ballot.  <em>See Meyer v. Grant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/414/case.html">486 U. S. 414</a></span> (1988).  The notion that solicitation is "inherently" more invasive of the public\'s peace of mind is untenable.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that any attempt to regulate solicitation on a case-by-case basis according to the general "disruption" regulation would be "unadministrable" because the Service "lacks the resources to enforce such regulation in the tens of thousands of post offices throughout the nation."  43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978).  But the Government\'s interest in brightline rules is hardly creditable, given that the Postal Service has chosen to adopt categorical restrictions on speech only with respect to solicitation.  If such application of the general disturbance and obstruction rules contained in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 232.1(e) and 232.1(k)(2) is "administrable" with respect to other types of speech, I fail to understand how a case-by-case inquiry suddenly becomes impracticable in the context of solicitation.

The Service could formulate, for example, reasonable restrictions on the size and placement of tables, on solicitation during peak postal hours, on the use of parking spaces by nonpostal customers, or on the number of persons who may engage in solicitation at the same time and place.  Although the Government would not be required to choose the least restrictive alternative were the plurality correct in its view that the sidewalk is a nonpublic forum, these other approaches </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 497 U.

And postal officials can rest assured in the knowledge that they can silence an entire category of expression without having to apply the existing postal regulations governing disruptive conduct or having to craft more narrow time, place, or manner rules.  Perhaps only three groups of people will be saddened by today\'s decision.  The first includes solicitors, who, in a farce of the public forum doctrine, will henceforth be permitted at postal locations to solicit the public only from such inhospitable locations as the busy four-lane highway that runs in front of the Bowie Post Office.  The next to be disappointed will be those members of the public who would prefer not to be deprived of the views of solicitors at postal locations.  The last group, unfortunately, includes all of us who are conscious of the importance of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> L.

Such confrontations, <em>if occurring in the confines of a small post office lobby, at a post office writing desk or service window, or in a queue at a service window</em> -- places from which the individual cannot escape if he or she wishes to transact postal business -- would be likely to produce hostile reactions and to cause people to avoid post offices."</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. 38824 (1978) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The concern expressed was limited to solicitation <em>inside</em> postal lobbies.  <em>See ibid.</em> ("The use of <em>lobby space</em> for such activity has been highly unsatisfactory") (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v.

While we have held that speech in a nonpublic forum may be regulated so as to prevent disruption of the forum, <em>see Cornelius,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/case.html#811">473 U. S. 811</a></span>, a restriction cannot be premised on the mere fact that some members of the public might disapprove of a speaker\'s message or means of delivery.  Such expression "is still protected speech, even in a nonpublic forum."  <em>Airport Commr\'s v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/569/case.html#576">482 U.

Postal regulations provide, for example, that photographs, "for news . . . purposes," may be taken "in entrances, lobbies, foyers, corridors, or auditoriums when used for public meetings."  \xc2\xa7 232.1(i).  Local postmasters obviously must decide on a case-by-case basis how to cope with the disruption posed by camera equipment, cables, and the presence of news media personnel.  Moreover, the regulation explicitly vests discretion in local post office officials with respect to photographs or other than news purposes:  "Other photographs may be taken only with the permission of the local postmaster or installation head."  Similarly, \xc2\xa7 232.1(<em>o</em>) grants local officials discretion to make case-by-case judgments concerning the appropriateness of displaying community notices and other materials of public interest on postal bulletin boards:</p>\n<p>"The Postal Service has no intention to discontinue . . . that valuable service [of providing a place for the display of public notices and announcements] to local communities.  The adopted regulation contains, as did the proposed rule, language insuring that the authority of postmasters to allow the placement in post offices of bulletin boards for the display of public notices and announcements, will continue as before.  Thus, both [\xc2\xa7 232.1(h)(1)(ii) and \xc2\xa7 232.1(<em>o</em>)(1)] contain language excepting from their coverage, \'posting notices on bulletin boards as authorized in \xc2\xa7 243.2(a) of this chapter.\'"</p>\n<p>"The reference[d] section authorizes both public and employee bulletin boards.  Postmasters are not required to provide bulletin board space for nongovernmental public announcements, but they are encouraged by postal policy to provide such space for the display of notices of public assemblies and judicial sales, official election notices issued by State or local government, and similar announcements so long as there is sufficient space for the effective display of scheduled postal materials and other Federal Government notices."</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. 38874-38825 (1978).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
