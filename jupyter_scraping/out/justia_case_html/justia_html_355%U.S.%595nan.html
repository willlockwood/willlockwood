United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/121/case.html">348 U. S. 121</a></span>, in support of its conclusion.  In <em>Holland,</em> we held that proof of a likely source was "sufficient" to convict in a net worth case where the Government did not negative all the possible nontaxable sources of the alleged net worth increase.  This was not intended to imply that proof of a likely source was necessary in every case.  On the contrary, should all possible sources of nontaxable income be negatived, there would be no necessity for proof of a likely source.  The above explanation must be taken </p><p><a class="page-number" name="596">Page 355 U. S. 596</a></p><p> into consideration in applying the <em>Holland</em> doctrine to this case.
