For the purpose of raising the funds necessary to complete and equip that branch, the lessee issued bonds to the amount of $246,000, interest payable in February and August, and mortgaged both branches of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 150 U.

On April 6, 1886, the court ordered the surrender made.  While the Clarinda Branch was in possession of the receivers, they expended in necessary maintenance, operation, and taxes a large sum in excess of the gross earnings therefrom.  The master to whom the case was referred was of the opinion that under the order of June 28, 1884, the receivers were only bound to pay the interest on the Clarinda bonds after meeting such other obligations as they had been directed to pay by the former orders of the court, found that the petitioner had not brought himself within the terms of that order, and recommended that the petition be dismissed, which was subsequently done.  34 F. 259, 38 F. 63.

JUSTICE BROWN, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case differs from the preceding one in the facts that rental to the amount of $7,920 was paid to August 1, 1884, instead of October 1, and possession of the road was ordered to be surrendered to Seney as trustee on April 6, 1886.  No complaint was made of unnecessary delay in giving up possession after application was made therefor.  The case is not distinguishable in principle from the other, and the decree of the court below dismissing the petition is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
