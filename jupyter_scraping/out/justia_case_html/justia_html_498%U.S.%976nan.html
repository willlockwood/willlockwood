The District Court in this case entered an order enjoining petitioner Cable News Network (CNN) from broadcasting taped communications between respondent Manuel Noriega, a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding, and his counsel. United States v. Noriega, 752 F.Supp. 1032 ( 1990). The court entered this order without any finding that suppression of the broadcast was necessary to protect Noriega\'s right to a fair trial, reasoning that no such determination need be made unless CNN surrendered the tapes for the court\'s inspection. The Court of Appeals affirmed this conclusion. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/917/1543/">917 F.2d 1543</a> (1991). [ Cable News Network, Inc. v.

Stuart, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/case.html#558">427 U.S. 539, 558</a>, 2802 (1976), quoting Organization for a Better Austin v.

I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled with these teachings. Even more fundamentally, if the lower courts in this case are correct in their remarkable conclusion that publication can be automatically restrained pending application of the demanding test established by Nebraska Press, then I think it is imperative that we reexamine the premises and operation of Nebraska Press itself. I would grant the stay application and the petition for certiorari. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1958547">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> CABLE NEWS NETWORK, INC. v.
