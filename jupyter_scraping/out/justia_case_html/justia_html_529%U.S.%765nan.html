The Court\'s longstanding interpretive presumption that "person" does not include the sovereign applies to the text of \xc2\xa7 3729(a).

As the historical context makes clear, various features of the FCA, both as originally enacted and as amended, far from providing the requisite affirmative indications that the term "person" included States for purposes of <i>qui tam </i>liability, indicate quite the contrary. This conclusion is buttressed by the ordinary rule of statutory construction that if Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the statute\'s language, and by the doctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions.

The phrase dates from at least the time of Blackstone. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *160.</p><p>Three other <i>qui tam </i>statutes, all also enacted over 100 years ago, remain on the books. See 25 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 81 (providing cause of action and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="769">769</a></p><p>FCA imposes civil liability upon "[a]ny person" who, <i>inter </i>alia, "knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government ... a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval." 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3729(a). The defendant is liable for up to treble damages and a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per claim. <i>Ibid. </i>An FCA action may be commenced in one of two ways. First, the Government itself may bring a civil action against the alleged false claimant. \xc2\xa7 3730(a). Second, as is relevant here, a private person (the relator) may bring a <i>qui tam </i>civil action "for the person and for the United States Government" against the alleged false claimant, "in the name of the Government." \xc2\xa7 3730(b)(1).</p><p>If a relator initiates the FCA action, he must deliver a copy of the complaint, and any supporting evidence, to the Government, \xc2\xa7 3730(b)(2), which then has 60 days to intervene in the action, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3730(b)(2), (4). If it does so, it assumes primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(1), though the relator may continue to participate in the litigation and is entitled to a hearing before voluntary dismissal and to a court determination of reasonableness before settlement, \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(2). If the Government declines to intervene within the 60-day period, the relator has the exclusive right to conduct the action, \xc2\xa7 3730(b)(4), and the Government may subsequently intervene only on a showing of "good cause," \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(3). The relator receives a share of any proceeds from the action-generally ranging from 15</p><p>share of recovery against a person contracting with Indians in an unlawful manner); \xc2\xa7201 (providing cause of action and share of recovery against a person violating Indian protection laws); 35 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 292(b) (providing cause of action and share of recovery against a person falsely marking patented articles); cf. 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 962 (providing for forfeiture to informer of share of vessels privately armed against friendly nations, but not expressly authorizing suit by informer); 46 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 723 (providing for forfeiture to informer of share of vessels removing undersea treasure from the Florida coast to foreign nations, but not expressly authorizing suit by informer).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="770">770</a></p><p>to 25 percent if the Government intervenes (depending upon the relator\'s contribution to the prosecution), and from 25 to 30 percent if it does not (depending upon the court\'s assessment of what is reasonable)-plus attorney\'s fees and costs. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3730(d)(1)-(2).</p><p>Respondent Jonathan Stevens brought this <i>qui tam </i>action in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont against petitioner Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, his former employer, alleging that it had submitted false claims to the Environmental Protection Agency (EP A) in connection with various federal grant programs administered by the EP A. Specifically, he claimed that petitioner had overstated the amount of time spent by its employees on the federally funded projects, thereby inducing the Government to disburse more grant money than petitioner was entitled to receive. The United States declined to intervene in the action. Petitioner then moved to dismiss, arguing that a State (or state agency) is not a "person" subject to liability under the FCA and that a <i>qui tam </i>action in federal court against a State is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The District Court denied the motion in an unpublished order. App. to Pet. for Cert. 86-87. Petitioner then filed an interlocutory appeal,2 and the District Court stayed proceedings pending its outcome. Respondent United States intervened in the appeal in support of respondent Stevens. A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/162/195/">162 F.3d 195</a> (1998), and we granted certiorari, 527 U. S. 1034 (1999).</p><p>2 The denial of a motion to dismiss based on a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity is immediately appealable. See <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority </i>v. <i>Metcalf </i>&amp; <i>Eddy, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/506/139/case.html">506 U. S. 139</a> (1993). The Second Circuit exercised pendent appellate jurisdiction over the statutory question. See <i>Swint </i>v. <i>Chambers County Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/35/case.html">514 U. S. 35</a>, 50-51 (1995).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="771">771</a></p><p>II</p><p>We first address the jurisdictional question whether respondent Stevens has standing under Article III of the Constitution to maintain this suit. See <i>Steel Co. </i>v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/case.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 93-102 (1998).</p><p>As we have frequently explained, a plaintiff must meet three requirements in order to establish Article III standing. See, <i>e. g., Friends of Earth, Inc. </i>v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/case.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 180-181 (2000). First, he must demonstrate "injury in fact"-a harm that is both "concrete" and "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical." <i>Whitmore </i>v. <i>Arkansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/149/case.html">495 U. S. 149</a>, 155 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Second, he must establish causation-a "fairly ... trace[able]" connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant. <i>Simon </i>v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U. S. 26</a>, 41 (1976). And third, he must demonstrate redressability-a "substantial likelihood" that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact. <i>Id., </i>at 45. These requirements together constitute the "irreducible constitutional minimum" of standing, <i>Lujan </i>v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/case.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560 (1992), which is an "essential and unchanging part" of Article Ill\'s case-orcontroversy requirement, <i>ibid., </i>and a key factor in dividing the power of government between the courts and the two political branches, see <i>id., </i>at 559-560.</p><p>Respondent Stevens contends that he is suing to remedy an injury in fact suffered by the United States. It is beyond doubt that the complaint asserts an injury to the United States-both the injury to its sovereignty arising from violation of its laws (which suffices to support a criminal lawsuit by the Government) and the proprietary injury resulting from the alleged fraud. But "[t]he Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury <i>to the complaining party." Warth </i>v. <i>Seldin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a>,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="772">772</a></p><p>499 (1975) (emphasis added); see also <i>Sierra Club </i>v. <i>Morton, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html">405 U. S. 727</a>, 734-735 (1972). It would perhaps suffice to say that the relator here is simply the statutorily designated agent of the United States, <i>in whose name </i>(as the statute provides, see 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3730(b)) the suit is brought-and that the relator\'s bounty is simply the fee he receives <i>out of the United States\' recovery </i>for filing and/or prosecuting a successful action on behalf of the Government. This analysis is precluded, however, by the fact that the statute gives the relator himself an interest <i>in the lawsuit, </i>and not merely the right to retain a fee out of the recovery. Thus, it provides that "[a] person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 <i>for the person and for the United States Government," </i>\xc2\xa7 3730(b) (emphasis added); gives the relator "the right to continue as a party to the action" even when the Government itself has assumed "primary responsibility" for prosecuting it, \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(1); entitles the relator to a hearing before the Government\'s voluntary dismissal of the suit, \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(2)(A); and prohibits the Government from settling the suit over the relator\'s objection without a judicial determination of "fair[ness], adequa[cy] and reasonable[ness]," \xc2\xa7 3730(c)(2)(B). For the portion of the recovery retained by the relator, therefore, some explanation of standing other than agency for the Government must be identified.</p><p>There is no doubt, of course, that as to this portion of the recovery-the bounty he will receive if the suit is successful-a <i>qui tam </i>relator has a "concrete private interest in the outcome of [the] suit." <i>Lujan, supra, </i>at 573. But the same might be said of someone who has placed a wager upon the outcome. An interest unrelated to injury in fact is insufficient to give a plaintiff standing. See <i>Valley Forge Christian College </i>v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html">454 U. S. 464</a>, 486 (1982); <i>Sierra Club, supra, </i>at 734-735. The interest must consist of obtaining compensation for, or preventing, the violation of a legally pro-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="773">773</a></p><p>tected right. See <i>Lujan, supra, </i>at 560-561. A <i>qui tam </i>relator has suffered no such invasion-indeed, the "right" he seeks to vindicate does not even fully materialize until the litigation is completed and the relator prevails.3 This is not to suggest that Congress cannot define new legal rights, which in turn will confer standing to vindicate an injury caused to the claimant. See <i>Warth, supra, </i>at 500. As we have held in another context, however, an interest that is merely a "byproduct" of the suit itself cannot give rise to a cognizable injury in fact for Article III standing purposes. See <i>Steel Co., supra, </i>at 107 ("[A] plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit"); see also <i>Diamond </i>v. <i>Charles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/54/case.html">476 U.

We conclude, therefore, that the United States\' injury in fact suffices to confer standing on respondent Stevens.</p><p>We are confirmed in this conclusion by the long tradition of <i>qui tam </i>actions in England and the American Colonies. That history is particularly relevant to the constitutional standing inquiry since, as we have said elsewhere, Article Ill\'s restriction of the judicial power to "Cases" and "Controversies" is properly understood to mean "cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process." <i>Steel Co., </i>523 U. S., at 102; see also <i>Coleman </i>v. <i>Miller, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/433/case.html">307 U. S. 433</a>, 460 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (the Constitution established that "[j]udicial power could come into play only in matters that were the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster and only if they arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constituted \'Cases\' or \'Controversies\' ").</p><p><i>Qui tam </i>actions appear to have originated around the end of the 13th century, when private individuals who had suffered injury began bringing actions in the royal courts on both their own and the Crown\'s behalf. See, <i>e. g., Prior of Lewes </i>v. <i>De Holt </i>(1300), reprinted in 48 Selden Society 198 (1931). Suit in this dual capacity was a device for getting their private claims into the respected royal courts, which generally entertained only matters involving the Crown\'s interests. See Milsom, Trespass from Henry III to Edward III, Part III: More Special Writs and Conclusions,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="775">775</a></p><p>74 L. Q. Rev. 561, 585 (1958). Starting in the 14th century, as the royal courts began to extend jurisdiction to suits involving wholly private wrongs, the common-law <i>qui tam </i>action gradually fell into disuse, although it seems to have remained technically available for several centuries. See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 369 (8th ed. 1824).</p><p>At about the same time, however, Parliament began enacting statutes that explicitly provided for <i>qui tam </i>suits. These were of two types: those that allowed injured parties to sue in vindication of their own interests (as well as the Crown\'s), see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Statute Providing a Remedy for Him Who Is Wrongfully Pursued in the Court of Admiralty, 2 Hen. IV; ch. 11 (1400), and-more relevant here-those that allowed informers to obtain a portion of the penalty as a bounty for their information, even if they had not suffered an injury themselves, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Statute Prohibiting the Sale of Wares After the Close of Fair, 5 Edw. III, ch. 5 (1331); see generally Common Informers Act, 14 &amp; 15 Geo. VI, ch. 39, sched. (1951) (listing informer statutes). Most, though not all, of the informer statutes expressly gave the informer a cause of action, typically by bill, plaint, information, or action of debt. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Bill for Leases of Hospitals, Colleges, and Other Corporations, 33 Hen. VIII, ch. 27 (1541); Act to Avoid Horse-Stealing, 31 Eliz. I, ch. 12, \xc2\xa7 2 (1589); Act to Prevent the Over-Charge of the People by Stewards of Court- Leets and Court-Barons, 2 Jac. I, ch. 5 (1604).</p><p>For obvious reasons, the informer statutes were highly subject to abuse, see M. Davies, The Enforcement of English Apprenticeship 58-61 (1956)-particularly those relating to obsolete offenses, see generally 3 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 191 (4th ed. 1797) (informer prosecutions under obsolete statutes had been used to "vex and entangle the subject"). Thus, many of the old enactments were repealed, see Act for Continuing and Reviving of Divers Statutes and Repeal of Divers Others, 21 Jac.

I, ch. 5 (1576); Act Concerning Informers, 31 Eliz. I, ch. 5 (1589); see generally Davies, <i>supra, </i>at 63-76. Nevertheless, laws allowing <i>qui tam </i>suits by informers continued to exist in England until 1951, when all of the remaining ones were repealed. See Note, The History and Development of Qui Tam, 1972 Wash. U. L. Q. 81, 88, and n. 44 (citing Common Informers Act, 14 &amp; 15 Geo. VI, ch. 39 (1951)).</p><p><i>Qui tam </i>actions appear to have been as prevalent in America as in England, at least in the period immediately before and after the framing of the Constitution. Although there is no evidence that the Colonies allowed commonlaw <i>qui tam </i>actions (which, as we have noted, were dying out in England by that time), they did pass several informer statutes expressly authorizing <i>qui tam </i>suits. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Act for the Restraining and Punishing of Privateers and Pirates, 1st Assembly, 4th Sess. (N.

See, <i>e. g., Kimel </i>v. <i>Florida Bd. of Regents, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/62/case.html">528 U.

When these two questions are at issue, not only is the statutory question "logically antecedent to the existence of" the Eleventh Amendment question, <i>Amchem Products, Inc. </i>v. <i>Windsor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/521/591/case.html">521 U. S. 591</a>, 612 (1997), but also there is no realistic possibility that addressing the statutory question will expand the Court\'s power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional restriction has imposed. The question whether the statute provides for suits against the States (as opposed, for example, to the broader question whether the statute creates any private cause of action whatever, or the question whether the facts alleged make out a "false claim" under the statute) does not, as a practical matter, permit the court to pronounce upon any issue, or upon the rights of any person, beyond the issues and persons that would be reached under the Eleventh Amendment inquiry anyway. The ultimate issue in the statutory inquiry is whether States can be sued under this statute; and the ultimate issue in the Eleventh Amendment inquiry is whether unconsenting States can be sued under this statute. This combination of logical priority</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="780">780</a></p><p>and virtual coincidence of scope makes it possible, and indeed appropriate, to decide the statutory issue first. We therefore begin (and will end) with the statutory question.</p><p>The relevant provision of the FCA, 31 U. S.

The dissent cites three cases in support of this assertion.

But the text of the original statute does less than nothing to overcome the presumption that States are <i>not </i>covered.</p><p>Although the liability provision of the original FCA has undergone various changes, none of them suggests a broadening of the term "person" to include States. In 1982, Congress made a housekeeping change, replacing the phrase "any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States, nor in the militia called into or actually employed in the service of the United States" with the phrase "[a] person not a member of an armed force of the United States," thereby incorporating the term of art "member of an armed force" used throughout Title 10 of the United States Code. 31 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 3729(a).12</p><p>Several features of the current statutory scheme further support the conclusion that States are not subject to <i>qui </i><i>tam </i>liability. First, another section of the FCA, 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3733, which enables the Attorney General to issue civil investigative demands to "any person ... possessi[ng] information relevant to a false claims law investigation," \xc2\xa7 3733(a)(1),</p><p>12 The dissent claims that "[t]he term \'person\' in \xc2\xa7 3729(a) that we are interpreting today was enacted by the 1986 Congress, not by the 1863 Congress." <i>Post, </i>at 794, n. 5. But the term "person" has remained in the statute unchanged since 1863; the 1986 amendment merely changed the modifier "[a]" to "[a]ny." This no more caused the word "person" to include States than did the replacement of the word "any" with "[a]" four years earlier. The dissent\'s sole basis for giving the change from "[a]" to "[a]ny" this precise and unusual consequence is a single sentence of legislative history from the 1986 Congress. That would be unequal to the task in any event, but as it happens the sentence was not even describing the consequence of the proposed revision, but was setting forth a Senate Committee\'s (erroneous) understanding of the meaning of the statutory term enacted some 123 years earlier. The paragraph in which the sentence appears discusses the FCA "[i]n its present," i. <i>e., </i>pre-1986, "form."</p><p>The dissent contradicts its contention that the "intent" of the 1986 Congress, rather than that of the 1863 Congress, controls here, by relying heavily on a House Committee Report from 1862. <i>Post, </i>at 791-792 (citing H. R. Rep. No.2, 37th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. ii-a, pp. XXXVIII-XXXIX (1862)). Even for those disposed to allow the meaning of a statute to be determined by a single committee, that Report is utterly irrelevant, since it was not prepared in connection with the 1863 Act, or indeed in connection with any proposed false claims legislation. In repeating the Second Circuit\'s unsupported assertion that Congress must have had this Report in mind a year later when it enacted the FCA, the dissent asks us to indulge even a greater suspension of disbelief than legislative history normally requires. And finally, this irrelevant committee Report does not provide the promised support for the view that "[t]he False Claims Act is ... as capable of being violated by state as by individual action," <i>post, </i>at 791. The cited portion details a single incident of fraud by a state <i>official </i>against a <i>State, </i>not an incident of fraud by a State against the Federal Government.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="784">784</a></p><p>contains a provision expressly defining "person," "[f]or purposes of this section," to include States, \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(4).13 </i>The presence of such a definitional provision in \xc2\xa7 3733, together with the absence of such a provision from the definitional provisions contained in \xc2\xa7 3729, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3729(b)-(c), suggests that States are not "persons" for purposes of <i>qui tam </i>liability under \xc2\xa7 3729.14</p><p>Second, the current version of the FCA imposes damages that are essentially punitive in nature, which would be in-</p><p>13 The dissent points out that the definition of "person" in \xc2\xa7 3733(l)( 4) also applies to \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(2), </i>a definitional provision which defines the phrase "false claims law investigation" as "any inquiry conducted by any false claims law investigator for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is or has been engaged in any violation of a false claims law." See <i>post, </i>at 789, 795. But the effect of assuming a State to be a "person" for purposes of that definitional section is <i>not </i>to embrace investigations of States within the definition. A "false claims investigation" will <i>still </i>not include an investigation of a State, since whether a "person" <i>(however </i>broadly defined) "is or has been engaged in any violation of a false claims law" depends on whether that person is <i>subject to </i>the "false claims law," which refers us back to \xc2\xa7 3729, to which \xc2\xa7 3733(l)(4)\'s definition of "person" is explicitly made inapplicable. What the application of \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(4) </i>to \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(2) does </i>achieve is to subject States, <i>not </i>to <i>qui tam </i>liability, but to civil investigative demands. That is entirely appropriate, since States will often be able to provide useful evidence in investigations of private contractors.</p><p>14 The dissent contends that our argument "prove[s] too much," since the definition of "person" in \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(4) </i>includes not just States, but also "any natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity"; under our reasoning, it contends, all of those entities would <i>also </i>be excluded from the definition of "person" under \xc2\xa7 3729. <i>Post, </i>at 799. That is not so. Unlike States, all of those entities are presumptively <i>covered </i>by the term "person." See 1 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1. The <i>addition </i>of States to 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3733, and the failure to add States to \xc2\xa7 3729, suggests that States are not subject to <i>qui tam </i>liability under \xc2\xa7 3729.</p><p>The dissent attempts to explain the absence of a definitional provision in \xc2\xa7 3729 by suggesting that Congress "simply saw no need to add a definition of \'person\' in \xc2\xa7 3729 because ... the meaning of the term \'person\' was already well understood." <i>Post, </i>at 799.

S., at 263. The dissent contends that <i>Newport </i>is inapplicable where, as here, "[t]he taxpaying \'citizens for whose benefit\' the [statute] is designed are the citizens of the United States, not the citizens of any individual State that might violate the [statute]." <i>Post, </i>at 801. The problem with this is that Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983-the statute at issue in <i>Newport-is, </i>like the FCA, a federal law designed to benefit "the citizens of the United States, not the citizens of any individual State that might violate the [statute]." A better reading of <i>Newport </i>is that we were concerned with imposing punitive damages on taxpayers under any circumstances. "\'[Punitive damages], being evidently vindictive, cannot, in our opinion, be sanctioned by this court, as they are to be borne by widows, orphans, aged men and women, and strangers, who, admitting that they must repair the injury inflicted by the Mayor on the plaintiff, cannot be bound beyond that amount, which will be sufficient for her indemnification.\'\'\' <i>Newport, supra, </i>at 261 (quoting <i>McGary </i>v. <i>President </i><i>&amp; </i><i>Council of City of Lafayette, </i>12 Rob. 668, 677 (La. 1846)).</p><p>16 As the dissent correctly points out, see <i>post, </i>at 801, n. 11, treble damages may be reduced to double damages in certain cases, see \xc2\xa7 3729(a).

See 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3801(a)(6) (defining "person" as "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization"). It would be most peculiar to subject States to treble damages and civil penalties in <i>qui tam </i>actions under the FCA, but exempt them from the relatively smaller damages provided under the PFCRA. See \xc2\xa7 3802(a)(1).17</p><p>17The dissent attempts to distinguish the PFCRA on the ground that it is a separate and subsequently enacted statute. See <i>post, </i>at 799-800, and n. 10. But it is well established that a court can, and should, interpret the text of one statute in the light of text of surrounding statutes, even those subsequently enacted. See <i>FDA </i>v. <i>Brown </i>&amp; <i>Williamson Tobacco Corp., ante, </i>at 133; <i>United States </i>v. <i>Fausto, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/439/case.html">484 U. S. 439</a>, 453 (1988). Moreover, there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in tandem with the FCA. Not only was it enacted at virtually the same time as the FCA was amended in 1986, but its scope is virtually identical to that of the FCA. Compare \xc2\xa7 3729(a) (FCA) ("Any person who ... knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government ... a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval ... ") with \xc2\xa7 3802(a)(1) (PFCRA) ("Any person who makes, presents, or submits, or causes to be made, presented, or submitted, a claim that the person knows or has reason to know ... is false, fictitious, or fraudulent ... "). The dissent would, in any event, subject States to suit under the PFCRA no less than under the FCA-despite its detailed definition of "person" that does not include States. In justification of this the dissent again cites <i>California </i>v. <i>United States, </i>320 U. S.,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="787">787</a></p><p>In sum, we believe that various features of the FCA, both as originally enacted and as amended, far from providing the requisite affirmative indications that the term "person" included States for purposes of <i>qui tam </i>liability, indicate quite the contrary. Our conclusion is buttressed by two other considerations that we think it unnecessary to discuss at any length: first, "the ordinary rule of statutory construction" that "if Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute," <i>Will, </i>491 U. S., at 65 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also <i>Gregory </i>v. <i>Ashcroft, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/452/case.html">501 U.

S. 336</a>, 349 (1971), and second, the doctrine that statutes should be construed so as to avoid difficult constitutional questions. We of course express no view on the question whether an action in federal court by a <i>qui tam </i>relator against a State would run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment, but we note that there is "a serious doubt" on that score. <i>Ashwander </i>v. <i>TV A, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U.

See <i>ante, </i>at 787-788. I note, however, that the clear statement rule applied to private suits against a State has not been applied when the United States is the plaintiff. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Sims </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/108/case.html">359 U.

I read the Court\'s decision to leave open the question whether the word "person" encompasses States when the United States itself sues under the False Claims Act.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, dissenting.</p><p>In 1986, Congress amended the False Claims Act (FCA or Act) to create a new procedure known as a "civil investigative demand," which allows the Attorney General to obtain documentary evidence "for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person is or has been engaged in" a violation of the Act-including a violation of 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3729. The 1986 amendments also declare that a "person" who could engage in a violation of \xc2\xa7 3729-thereby triggering the civil investigative demand provision-includes "any State or political subdivision of a State." See \xc2\xa7 6(a), 100 Stat. 3168 (codified at 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(1)(A), </i>(2), (4)). In my view, this statutory text makes it perfectly clear that Congress intended the term "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729 to include States. This understanding is supported by the legislative history of the 1986 amendments, and is fully consistent with this Court\'s construction of federal statutes in cases decided before those amendments were enacted.</p><p>Since the FCA was amended in 1986, however, the Court has decided a series of cases that cloak the States with an increasingly protective mantle of "sovereign immunity" from</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="790">790</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>liability for violating federal laws. It is through the lens of those post-1986 cases that the Court has chosen to construe the statute at issue in this case. To explain my disagreement with the Court, I shall comment on pre-1986 cases, the legislative history of the 1986 amendments, and the statutory text of the FCA-all of which support the view that Congress understood States to be included within the meaning of the word "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729. I shall then briefly explain why the State\'s constitutional defenses fail, even under the Court\'s post-1986 construction of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Cases decided before 1986 uniformly support the proposition that the broad language used in the FCA means what it says. Although general statutory references to "persons" are not normally construed to apply to the enacting sovereign, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mine Workers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/258/case.html">330 U. S. 258</a>, 275 (1947), when Congress uses that word in federal statutes enforceable by the Federal Government or by a federal agency, it applies to States and state agencies as well as to private individuals and corporations. Thus, for example, the word "person" in the Sherman Act does not include the sovereign that enacted the statute (the Federal Government), <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cooper Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html">312 U. S. 600</a> (1941), but it does include the States, <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Evans, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/159/case.html">316 U. S. 159</a> (1942). Similarly, States are subject to regulation as a "person" within the meaning of the Shipping Act of 1916, <i>California </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/577/case.html">320 U. S. 577</a> (1944), and as a "common carrier" within the meaning of the Safety Appliance Act, <i>United States </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html">297 U. S. 175</a> (1936). In the latter case, the State of California "invoke[d] the canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound" by a statute unless the Act expressly declares that to be the case. <i>Id., </i>at 186. We rejected the applicability of that canon, stating:</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="791">791</a></p><blockquote><p>\n"We can perceive no reason for extending it so as to exempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, allembracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action.

Indeed, the fact that Congress has authorized <i>qui tam </i>actions by private individuals to supplement the remedies available to the Federal Government provides additional evidence of its intent to reach all types of fraud that cause financial loss to the Federal Government. Finally, the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="793">793</a></p><p>breadth of the "claims" to which the FCA applies 3 only confirms the notion that the law was intended to cover the full range of fraudulent acts, including those perpetrated by States.4</p><p>The legislative history of the 1986 amendments discloses that both federal and state officials understood that States were "persons" within the meaning of the statute. Thus, in a section of the 1986 Senate Report describing the history of the Act, the committee unequivocally stated that the Act reaches all parties who may submit false claims and that "[t]he term \'person\' is used in its broad sense to include partnerships, associations, and corporations ... as well as States and political subdivisions thereof." S. Rep. No. 99345, pp. 8-9.5</p><p>3 Title 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3729(c) reads: "For purposes of this section, \'claim\' includes any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for money or property which is made to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the United States Government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the Government will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded."</p><p>4 When Congress amended the FCA in 1986, it noted that "[e]vidence of fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a steady rise." H. R. Rep. No. 99-660, at 18. And at that time, federal grants to state and local governments had totaled over $108 billion. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce National Data Book and Guide to Sources, Statistical Abstract of the United States 301 (108th ed. 1988) (compiling data from 1986). It is therefore difficult to believe, as the Court contends, that Congress intended "to cover all types of <i>fraud, </i>[but not] all types of <i>fraudsters," ante, </i>at 781, n. 10, a conclusion that would exclude from coverage such a large share of potential fraud.</p><p>5 Petitioner argues that the Senate Report\'s statement was simply inaccurate, because the three cases to which the Report cited for support did not interpret the meaning of the word "person" in the FCA. Brief for Petitioner 25-26. The cases stand for the proposition that the statutory term "person" may include States and local governments-exactly the proposition I have discussed above. See <i>supra, </i>at 790. Petitioner\'s observation that none of the cases cited is directly on point only indicates</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="794">794</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>Indeed, a few federal courts had accepted jurisdiction in <i>qui tam </i>cases brought by the States-thus indicating their view that States were included among the "persons" who may bring <i>qui tam </i>actions as relators under \xc2\xa7 3730(b)(1). See <i>United States ex rel. Woodard </i>v. <i>Country View Care Center, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/797/888/">797 F.2d 888</a> (CAlO 1986); <i>United States ex rel. Wisconsin </i>v. <i>Dean, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/729/1100/">729 F.2d 1100</a> <i>(CA7 </i>1984); see also <i>United States ex rel. Hartigan </i>v. <i>Palumbo Bros., Inc., 797 </i>F. Supp. 624 (ND Ill. 1992). Not only do these cases express the view of those federal judges who thought a State could be a "person" under \xc2\xa7 3730(b)(1), but the cases also demonstrate that the States considered themselves to be statutory "persons." In fact, in the <i>Dean </i>case, the United States filed a statement with the court explicitly stating its view that "[t]he State is a proper relator." 729 F. 2d, at 1103, n. 2. And when the Seventh Circuit in that case dismissed Wisconsin\'s <i>qui tam </i>claim on grounds unrelated to the definition</p><p>that the Senate\'s understanding was based on an analogy rather than on controlling precedent.</p><p>Petitioner further argues that the text of the FCA as it was originally enacted in 1863 could not have included States as "persons," and therefore the Senate\'s understanding of the pre-1986 Act was erroneous. See also <i>ante, </i>at 778. Assuming for argument\'s sake that the Senate incorrectly ascertained what Congress meant in 1863, petitioner\'s argument is beside the point. The term "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729(a) that we are interpreting today was enacted by the 1986 Congress, not by the 1863 Congress. See 100 Stat. 3153 (deleting entirely the previously existing introductory clause in \xc2\xa7 3729, including the phrase "[a] person not a member of an armed force of the United States" and replacing it with the new phrase "[a]ny person"). Therefore, even if the 1986 Congress were mistaken about what a <i>previous </i>Legislature had meant by the word "person," it clearly expressed its own view that when the 1986 <i>Congress itself </i>enacted the word "person" (and not merely the word "any" as the Court insists, <i>ante, </i>at 783, n. 12), it meant the reference to include States. There is not the least bit of contradiction (as the Court suggests, <i>ibid.) </i>in one Congress informing itself of the general understanding of a statutory term it enacts based on its own (perhaps erroneous) understanding of what a past Congress thought the term meant.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="795">795</a></p><p>of the word "person," the National Association of Attorneys General adopted a resolution urging Congress to make it easier for States to be relators.6 When Congress amended the FCA in 1986-and enacted the word "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729 at issue here-it had all of this information before it, i. <i>e., </i>that federal judges had accepted States as relators (and hence as "persons"); that the States considered themselves to be statutory "persons" and wanted greater freedom to be "persons" who could sue under the Act; and that the United States had taken a like position. See S. Rep. No. 99-345, at 12-13.</p><p>In sum, it is quite clear that when the 1986 amendments were adopted, there was a general understanding that States and state agencies were "persons" within the meaning of the Act.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The text of the 1986 amendments confirms the pre-existing understanding. The most significant part of the amendments is the enactment of a new \xc2\xa7 3733 granting authority to the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative demand (CID) before commencing a civil proceeding on behalf of the United States. A series of interwoven definitions in \xc2\xa7 3733 unambiguously demonstrates that a State is a "person" who can violate \xc2\xa7 3729.</p><p>Section 3733 authorizes the Attorney General to issue a CID when she is conducting a "false claims law investigation." \xc2\xa7 3733(a). A "false claims law investigation" is defined as an investigation conducted "for the purpose of ascertaining whether <i>any person </i>is or has been engaged in any violation of a false claims law." \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(2) </i>(emphasis added). And a "false claims law" includes \xc2\xa7 3729-the provision at issue in this case. \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(1)(A). </i>Quite plainly, these provisions contemplate that any "person" may be en-</p><p>6 Congress adopted the suggestion of the Attorneys General in \xc2\xa7 3730(e)(4)(A).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="796">796</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>gaged in a violation of \xc2\xa7 3729. Finally, a "person" is defined to include "any State or political subdivision of a State." \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(4). </i>Hence, the CID provisions clearly state that a "person" who may be "engaged in any violation of a false claims law," including \xc2\xa7 3729, includes a "State or a political subdivision of a State." 7 These CID provisions thus unmistakably express Congress\' understanding that a State may be a "person" who can violate \xc2\xa7 3729.</p><p>Elsewhere in the False Claims Act the term "person" includes States as well. For example, \xc2\xa7 3730 of the Actboth before and after the 1986 amendments-uses the word "person" twice. First, subsection (a) of \xc2\xa7 3730 directs the Attorney General to investigate violations of \xc2\xa7 3729, and provides that if she "finds that a <i>person </i>has violated or is violating" that section, she may bring a civil action "under this section against the <i>person." </i>(Emphases added.) Second, subsection (b) of \xc2\xa7 3730 also uses the word "person," though for a different purpose; in that subsection the word is used to describe the plaintiffs who may bring <i>qui tam </i>actions on behalf of themselves and the United States.</p><p>Quite clearly, a State is a "person" against whom the Attorney General may proceed under \xc2\xa7 3730(a).8 And as I noted earlier, see <i>supra, </i>at 794, before 1986 States were considered "persons" who could bring a <i>qui tam </i>action as a relator under \xc2\xa7 3730(b)-and the Court offers nothing to question that understanding. See <i>ante, </i>at 787, n. 18. Moreover, when a <i>qui tam </i>relator brings an action on behalf of the United States, he or she is, in effect, authorized to act as an assignee of the Federal Government\'s claim. See <i>ante, </i>at 773. Given that understanding, combined with the fact</p><p>7 Because this concatenation of definitions expressly references and incorporates \xc2\xa7 3729, it is no answer that the definitions listed in \xc2\xa7 3733 apply, by their terms, "[f]or the purposes of" \xc2\xa7 3733.</p><p>8JUSTICE GINSBURG, who joins in the Court\'s judgment, is careful to point out that the Court does not disagree with this reading of \xc2\xa7 3730(a). <i>Ante, </i>at 789.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="797">797</a></p><p>that \xc2\xa7 3730(a) does not make any distinction between possible defendants against whom the Attorney General may bring an action, the most normal inference to draw is that <i>qui tam </i>actions may be brought by relators against the same category of "persons" that may be sued by the Attorney General.</p><p>To recapitulate, it is undisputed that (under the CID provision) a State is a "person" who may violate \xc2\xa7 3729; that a State is a "person" who may be named as a defendant in an action brought by the Attorney General; and that a State is a "person" who may bring a <i>qui tam </i>action on behalf of the United States. It therefore seems most natural to read the adjacent uses of the term "person" in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3729, 3730(a), 3730(b), and 3733 to cover the same category of defendants. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cooper Corp., </i>312 U. S., at 606 ("It is hardly credible that Congress used the term \'person\' in different senses in the same sentence"). And it seems even more natural to read the single word "person" (describing who may commit a violation under \xc2\xa7 3729) to have one consistent meaning regardless of whether the action against that violator is brought under \xc2\xa7 3730(a) or under \xc2\xa7 3730(b). See <i>Ratzlaf </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/135/case.html">510 U. S. 135</a>, 143 (1994) ("A term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears. We have even stronger cause to construe a single formulation ... the same way each time it is called into play" (citation omitted)). Absent powerful arguments to the contrary, it should follow that a State may be named as a defendant in an action brought by an assignee of the United States. Rather than pointing to any such powerful arguments, however, the Court comes to a contrary conclusion on the basis of an inapplicable presumption and rather strained inferences drawn from three different statutory provisions.</p><p>The Court\'s principal argument relies on "our longstanding interpretive presumption that \'person\' does not include the sovereign." <i>Ante, </i>at 780. As discussed earlier, that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="798">798</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>"presumption" does not quite do the heavy lifting the Court would like it to do. What\'s more, the doctrinal origins of that "presumption" meant only that the <i>enacting sovereign </i>was not normally thought to be a statutory "person." See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>California, </i>297 U. S., at 186 ("[T]he canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound by its own statute unless named in it ... has its historical basis in the English doctrine that the Crown is unaffected by acts of Parliament not specifically directed against it. The presumption is an aid to consistent construction of statutes of the <i>enacting sovereign </i>when their purpose is in doubt" (emphasis added)); see also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mine Workers, </i>330 U. S., at 275; <i>United States </i>v. <i>Fox, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/315/case.html">94 U. S. 315</a>, 321 (1877); <i>Will </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html">491 U. S. 58</a>, 73 (1989) (Brennan, J., dissenting). The reason for presuming that an enacting sovereign does not intend to authorize litigation against itself simply does not apply to federal statutes that apply equally to state agencies and private entities. Finally, the "affirmative showing" the Court would require to demonstrate that the word "person" includes States, <i>ante, </i>at 781, is plainly found in the statutory text discussed above.</p><p>The Court\'s first textual argument is based on the fact that the definition of the term "person" included in \xc2\xa7 3733\'s CID provision expressly includes States. "The presence of such a definitional provision in \xc2\xa7 3733," the Court argues, "together with the absence of such a provision from the definitional provisions contained in \xc2\xa7 3729 ... suggests that States are not \'persons\' for purposes of <i>qui tam </i>liability under \xc2\xa7 3729." <i>Ante, </i>at 784. Leaving aside the fact that \xc2\xa7 3733\'s definition actually cuts in the opposite direction, see <i>supra, </i>at 795-796, this argument might carry some weight if the definitional provisions in \xc2\xa7 3729 included <i>some </i>definition of "person" but simply neglected to mention States. But the definitional provisions in \xc2\xa7 3729 do not in-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="799">799</a></p><p>clude any definition of "person" at all. The negative inference drawn by the Court, if taken seriously, would therefore prove too much. The definition of "person" in \xc2\xa7 3733 includes not only States, but also "any natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity." \xc2\xa7 <i>3733(l)(4). </i>If the premise of the Court\'s argument were correct-that the inclusion of certain items as a "person" in \xc2\xa7 3733 implies their exclusion as a "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729-then there would be <i>absolutely no one left </i>to be a "person" under \xc2\xa7 3729.9 It is far more reasonable to assume that Congress simply saw no need to add a definition of "person" in \xc2\xa7 3729 because (as both the legislative history, see <i>supra, </i>at 791795, and the definitions in the CID provisions demonstrate) the meaning of the term "person" was already well understood. Congress likely thought it unnecessary to include a definition in \xc2\xa7 3729 itself.</p><p>The Court also relies on the definition of "person" in a separate, but similar, statute, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA). <i>Ante, </i>at 786. The definition of "person" found in that law includes "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization." 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3801(a)(6). It is first worth pointing out the obvious: Although the PFCRA sits next to the FCA in the United States Code, they are separate statutes. It is therefore not altogether clear why the former has much bearing on the latter.1o Regardless, the Court\'s whole argument</p><p>9 Not so, the Court says, because natural persons and other entities, unlike States, are <i>presumed </i>to be included within the term "person." <i>Ante, </i>at 784, n. 14. In other words, this supposedly independent textual argument does nothing on its own without relying entirely on the presumption already discussed. See <i>supra, </i>at 797-798; <i>ante, </i>at 780784. The negative inference adds nothing on its own.</p><p>10 Indeed, reliance on the PFCRA seems to contradict the Court\'s central premise-that in 1863 the word "person" did not include States and that scattered intervening amendments have done nothing to change that. <i>Ante, </i>at 781-782. If that were so, the relevant meaning of the word</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="800">800</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>about the PFCRA rests entirely on the premise that its definition of "person" does not include States. That premise, in turn, relies upon the fact that \xc2\xa7 3801(a)(6) in the PFCRA defines a "person" to include "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization," but does not mention States. We have, however, interpreted similar definitions of "person," which included corporations, partnerships, and associations, to include States as well, even though States were not expressly mentioned in the statutory definition. See <i>California </i>v. <i>United States, </i>320 U. S., at 585; <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>Evans, </i>316 U. S., at 160. (I draw no definitive conclusions as to whether States are subject to suit under the PFCRA; I only mean to suggest that the Court\'s premise is not as obvious as it presumes it to be.) In any event, the ultimate relevant question is whether the text and legislative history <i>of the FCA </i>make it clear that \xc2\xa7 3729\'s use of the word "person" includes States. Because they do, nothing in any other piece of legislation narrows the meaning of that term.</p><p>Finally, the Court relies on the fact that the current version of the FCA includes a treble damages remedy that is "essentially punitive in nature." <i>Ante, </i>at 784. Citing <i>Newport </i>v. <i>Fact Concerts, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/247/case.html">453 U. S. 247</a>, 262-263 (1981), the Court invokes the "presumption against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities." <i>Ante, </i>at 785. But as <i>Newport </i>explains, "courts vie[w] punitive damages [against governmental bodies] as contrary to sound public policy, because such awards would burden the very tax-</p><p>"person" would be the meaning adopted by the 1863 Congress, not the 1986 Congress. And on that premise, why should it matter what a different Congress, in a different century, did in a separate statute? Of course, as described earlier, see n. 5, <i>supra, </i>I believe it is the 1986 Congress\' understanding of the word "person" that controls, because it is that word <i>as enacted </i>by the 1986 <i>Congress </i>that we are interpreting in this case. But on the Court\'s premise, it is the 1863 Congress\' understanding that controls and the PFCRA should be irrelevant.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="801">801</a></p><p>payers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was being chastised." 453 U. S., at 263. That rationale is inapplicable here. The taxpaying "citizens for whose benefit" the FCA is designed are the citizens of the United States, not the citizens of any individual State that might violate the Act. It is true, of course, that the taxpayers of a State that violates the FCA will ultimately bear the burden of paying the treble damages. It is not the coffers of the State (and hence state taxpayers), however, that the FCA is designed to protect, but the coffers of the National Government (and hence the federal taxpayers). Accordingly, a treble damages remedy against a State does not "burden the very taxpayers" the statute was designed to protect.ll</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Each of the constitutional issues identified in the Court\'s opinion requires only a brief comment. The historical evidence summarized by the Court, <i>ante, </i>at 774-778, is obviously sufficient to demonstrate that <i>qui tam </i>actions are "cases" or "controversies" within the meaning of Article III. That evidence, together with the evidence that private prosecutions were commonplace in the 19th century, see <i>Steel Co. </i>v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/case.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 127-128, and nn. 24-25 (1998) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), is also sufficient to resolve the Article II question that the Court has introduced <i>sua sponte, ante, </i>at 778, n. 8.</p><p>As for the State\'s "Eleventh Amendment" sovereign immunity defense, I adhere to the view that <i>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </i>v. <i>Florida, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/case.html">517 U.

Accordingly, Congress\' clear intention to subject States to <i>qui tam </i>actions is also</p><p>11 It is also worth mentioning that treble damages may be reduced to double damages if the court makes the requisite findings under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3729(a)(7)(A)-(C).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="802">802</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>sufficient to abrogate any common-law defense of sovereign immunity. Moreover, even if one accepts <i>Seminole Tribe </i>as controlling, the State\'s immunity claim would still fail. Given the facts that (1) respondent is, in effect, suing as an assignee of the United States, <i>ante, </i>at 773; (2) the Eleventh Amendment does not provide the States with a defense to claims asserted by the United States, see, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Mississippi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/128/case.html">380 U.
