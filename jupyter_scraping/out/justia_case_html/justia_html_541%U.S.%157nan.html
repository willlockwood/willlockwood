In upholding OIC\xe2\x80\x99s exemption claim, the District Court balanced the Foster family\xe2\x80\x99s privacy interest against any public interest in disclosure, holding that the former could be infringed by disclosure and that Favish had not shown how disclosure would advance his investigation, especially in light of the exhaustive investigation that had already occurred.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Favish need not show knowledge of agency misfeasance to support his request, and remanded the case for the interests to be balanced consistent with its opinion.  On remand, the District Court ordered the release of five of the photographs.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the release of four.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0FOIA recognizes surviving family members\xe2\x80\x99 right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative\xe2\x80\x99s death-scene images.  Favish\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s personal privacy right is confined to the right to control information about oneself is too narrow an interpretation of Department of Justice</em> v. <em>Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/749/index.html">489 U. S. 749</a>, which held that the personal privacy concept must encompass an individual\xe2\x80\x99s control of information about himself, but had no occasion to consider whether those whose personal data are not in the requested materials also have a recognized privacy interest under the exemption.  It did explain, however, that Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s concept of privacy is not a limited or cramped notion.  The exemption is in marked contrast to Exemption 6, which requires withholding of personnel and medical files only if disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s comparative breadth\xe2\x80\x94it does not include \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d and uses \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to constitute\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cwould constitute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is no drafting accident, but is the result of specific amendments to an existing statute.  Because law enforcement documents often have information about persons whose link to the official inquiry may be the result of mere happenstance, there is special reason to protect intimate personal data, to which the public does not have a general right of access in the ordinary course.  The modifier \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d does not bolster Favish\xe2\x80\x99s view that the family has no privacy interest in a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s pictures.  Foster\xe2\x80\x99s relatives invoke that interest to secure their own refuge from a sensation-seeking culture for their own peace of mind and tranquility, not for the sake of Foster\xe2\x80\x99s reputation or some other interest personal to him.  It is proper to conclude that Congress intended to permit family members to assert their own privacy rights against public intrusions long deemed impermissible under the common law and cultural traditions.  This does not mean that the family is in the same position as the individual who is the disclosure\xe2\x80\x99s subject.  However, this Court has little difficulty in finding in case law and traditions the right of family members to direct and control disposition of a deceased\xe2\x80\x99s body and to limit attempts to exploit pictures of the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s remains for public purposes.  The well-established cultural tradition of acknowledging a family\xe2\x80\x99s control over the body and the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s death images has long been recognized at common law.  In enacting FOIA and amending Exemption 7(C) to extend its terms, Congress legislated against this background and the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s consistent interpretation of the exemption.  The exemption protects a statutory privacy right that goes beyond the common law and the Constitution, see <em>id., </em>at 762, n.\xc2\xa013.  It would be anomalous to hold in this case that the statute provides less protection than does the common law.  The statute must also be understood in light of the consequences that would follow from Favish\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Since FOIA withholding cannot be predicated on the requester\xe2\x80\x99s identity, violent criminals, who often make FOIA requests, would be able to obtain autopsies, photographs, and records of their deceased victims at the expense of surviving family members\xe2\x80\x99 personal privacy.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Foster family\xe2\x80\x99s privacy interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  As a general rule, citizens seeking documents subject to FOIA disclosure are not required to explain why they seek the information.  However, when Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s privacy concerns are present, the requester must show that public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake, and that the information is likely to advance that interest.  The Court does not in this single decision attempt to define the reasons that will suffice, or the necessary nexus between the requested information and the public interest served by disclosure, but there must be some stability with respect to both the specific category of privacy interests protected and the specific category of public interests that could outweigh the privacy claim.  Here, the Ninth Circuit correctly ruled that the family has a privacy interest protected by the statute and recognized as significant the asserted public interest in uncovering deficiencies or misfeasance in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s investigations into Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death, but it erred in defining the showing Favish must make to establish his public interest claim.  By requiring no particular evidence of some actual misfeasance or other impropriety, that court\xe2\x80\x99s holding leaves Exemption 7(C) with little force or content.  Under its rationale, the invasion of privacy would be extensive, since once disclosed, information belongs to the general public.  Thus, where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in performing their duties, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.  When the presumption of legitimacy accorded to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s official conduct is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it.  Given FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s pro-disclosure purpose, however, a less stringent standard is more faithful to the statutory scheme.  Only when the FOIA requester has produced evidence sufficient to warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred will there be a counterweight on the FOIA scale for a court to balance against the cognizable privacy interests in the requested documents.  Favish has produced no evidence to put that balance into play.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s first order\xe2\x80\x94before it was set aside by the Ninth Circuit and superseded by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order\xe2\x80\x94followed the correct approach.

S. 749</a> (1989), we considered the scope of Exemption 7(C) and held that release of the document at issue would be a prohibited invasion of the personal privacy of the person to whom the document referred.  The principal document involved was the criminal record, or rap sheet, of the person who himself objected to the disclosure.  Here, the information pertains to an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding an apparent suicide.  The initial question is whether the exemption extends to the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s family when the family objects to the release of photographs showing the condition of the body at the scene of death.  If we find the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s family does have a personal privacy interest recognized by the statute, we must then consider whether that privacy claim is outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vincent Foster, Jr., deputy counsel to President Clinton, was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, located just outside Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  The United States Park Police conducted the initial investigation and took color photographs of the death scene, including 10 pictures of Foster\xe2\x80\x99s body.  The investigation concluded that Foster committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver.  Subsequent investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr reached the same conclusion.  Despite the unanimous finding of these five investigations, a citizen interested in the matter, Allan Favish, remained skeptical.  Favish is now a respondent in this proceeding.  In an earlier proceeding, Favish was the associate counsel for Accuracy in Media (AIM), which applied under FOIA for Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death-scene photographs.  After the National Park Service, which then maintained custody of the pictures, resisted disclosure, Favish filed suit on behalf of AIM in the District Court for the District of Columbia to compel production.  The District Court granted summary judgment against AIM.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia unanimously affirmed.  <em>Accuracy in Media, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Park Serv.</em>, 194 F.\xc2\xa03d 120 (1999).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still convinced that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s investigations were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98grossly incomplete and untrustworthy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a, Favish filed the present FOIA request in his own name, seeking, among other things, 11 pictures, 1 showing Foster\xe2\x80\x99s eyeglasses and 10 depicting various parts of Foster\xe2\x80\x99s body.  Like the National Park Service, the Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) refused the request under Exemption 7(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, Favish sued to compel production, this time in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  As a preliminary matter, the District Court held that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did not have collateral estoppel effect on Favish\xe2\x80\x99s California lawsuit brought in his personal capacity.  On the merits, the court granted partial summary judgment to OIC.  With the exception of the picture showing Foster\xe2\x80\x99s eyeglasses, the court upheld OIC\xe2\x80\x99s claim of exemption.  Relying on the so-called <em>Vaughn</em> index provided by the Government\xe2\x80\x94a narrative description of the withheld photos, see<em> Vaughn</em> v. <em>Rosen</em>, 484 F.\xc2\xa02d 820 (CADC 1973)\xe2\x80\x94the court held, first, that Foster\xe2\x80\x99s surviving family members enjoy personal privacy interests that could be infringed by disclosure of the photographs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.  It then found, with respect to the asserted public interest, that \xe2\x80\x9c[Favish] has not sufficiently explained how disclosure of these photographs will advance his investigation into Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 59a.  Any purported public interest in disclosure, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cis lessened because of the exhaustive investigation that has already occurred regarding Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 58a.  Balancing the competing interests, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe privacy interests of the Foster family members outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 59a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the first appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the majority reversed and remanded, over Judge Pregerson\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.  217 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168 (2000).  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, although evidence or knowledge of misfeasance by the investigative agency may \xe2\x80\x9cenhanc[e] the urgency of the [FOIA] request,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the statutory command conditions [disclosure] on the requesting party showing that he has knowledge of misfeasance by the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1172\xe2\x80\x931173.  Furthermore, because \xe2\x80\x9cFavish, in fact, tenders evidence and argument which, if believed, would justify his doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d the FOIA request \xe2\x80\x9cis in complete conformity with the statutory purpose that the public know what its government is up to.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This was so, the Court of Appeals held, even in the face of five previous investigations into Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death:  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the statutory command shields an agency from disclosing its records because other agencies have engaged in similar investigations\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0[I]t is a feature of famous cases that they generate controversy, suspicion, and the desire to second guess the authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1173.  As the majority read the statute, there is \xe2\x80\x9ca right to look, a right to speculate and argue again, a right of public scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, however, agreed with the District Court that the exemption recognizes the Foster family members\xe2\x80\x99 right to personal privacy.  Although the pictures contain no information about Foster\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s protection \xe2\x80\x9cextends to the memory of the deceased held by those tied closely to the deceased by blood or love.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nevertheless, the majority held that the District Court erred in balancing the relevant interests based only on the <em>Vaughn </em>index.  While \xe2\x80\x9cthe [D]istrict [C]ourt has discretion to decide a FOIA case on the basis of affidavits, and affidavits are in some cases sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe agency affidavits are insufficiently detailed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1174.  It remanded the case to the District Court to examine the photos <em>in camera</em> and, \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with [the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99] opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbalance the effect of their release on the privacy of the Foster family against the public benefit to be obtained by their release.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>On remand, the District Court ordered release of the following five photographs:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The photograph identified as \xe2\x80\x983\xe2\x80\x94VF\xe2\x80\x99s [Vincent Fos-\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ter\xe2\x80\x99s] body looking down from top of berm\xe2\x80\x99 must be \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0released, as the photograph is not so explicit as to \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0overcome the public interest.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The photograph entitled \xe2\x80\x985\xe2\x80\x94VF\xe2\x80\x99s body\xe2\x80\x94focusing on\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rt. side of shoulder arm\xe2\x80\x99 is again of such a nature\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0as to be discoverable in that it is not focused in such\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0a manner as to unnecessarily impact the privacy in-</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0terests of the family.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The photograph entitled \xe2\x80\x981\xe2\x80\x94Right hand showing\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0gun &amp; thumb in guard\xe2\x80\x99 is discoverable as it may be\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0probative of the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to know.</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The photograph entitled \xe2\x80\x984\xe2\x80\x94VF\xe2\x80\x99s body focusing on\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0right side and arm\xe2\x80\x99 is discoverable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The photograph entitled \xe2\x80\x985\xe2\x80\x94VF\xe2\x80\x99s body\xe2\x80\x94focus on\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0top of head thru heavy foliage\xe2\x80\x99 is discoverable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the second appeal to the same panel, the majority, again over Judge Pregerson\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, affirmed in part.  37 Fed.

His argument rests on the proposition that the information is only about the decedent, not his family.  FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s right to personal privacy, in his view, means only \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to control information about oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Favish 4.  He quotes from our decision in <em>Reporters Committee</em>, where, in holding that a person has a privacy interest sufficient to prevent disclosure of his own rap sheet, we said \xe2\x80\x9cthe common law and the literal understandings of privacy encompass the individual\xe2\x80\x99s control of information concerning his or her person.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U.

The right to personal privacy is not confined, as Favish argues, to the \xe2\x80\x9cright to control information about oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Favish 4.  Favish misreads the quoted sentence in <em>Reporters Committee </em>and adopts too narrow an interpretation of the case\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  To say that the concept of personal privacy must \xe2\x80\x9cencompass\xe2\x80\x9d the individual\xe2\x80\x99s control of information about himself does not mean it cannot encompass other personal privacy interests as well.  <em>Reporters Committee </em>had no occasion to consider whether individuals whose personal data are not contained in the requested materials also have a recognized privacy interest under Exemption 7(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Reporters Committee</em> explained, however, that the concept of personal privacy under Exemption 7(C) is not some limited or \xe2\x80\x9ccramped notion\xe2\x80\x9d of that idea.  489 U.

This provision is in marked contrast to the language in Exemption 6, pertaining to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel and medical files,\xe2\x80\x9d where withholding is required only if disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(6).

In addition, \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas Exemption 6 refers to disclosures that \xe2\x80\x98would constitute\xe2\x80\x99 an invasion of privacy, Exemption 7(C) encompasses any disclosure that \xe2\x80\x98could reasonably be expected to constitute\xe2\x80\x99 such an invasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reporters Committee</em>, 489 U. S., at 756.  Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s comparative breadth is no mere accident in drafting.  We know Congress gave special consideration to the language in Exemption 7(C) because it was the result of specific amendments to an existing statute.  See <em>id.</em>, at 756, n.\xc2\xa09, 777, n.\xc2\xa022.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Law enforcement documents obtained by Government investigators often contain information about persons interviewed as witnesses or initial suspects but whose link to the official inquiry may be the result of mere happenstance.  There is special reason, therefore, to give protection to this intimate personal data, to which the public does not have a general right of access in the ordinary course.  <em>Id.,</em> at 773.  In this class of cases where the subject of the documents \xe2\x80\x9cis a private citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe privacy interest \xe2\x80\xa6 is at its apex.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 780.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certain <em>amici </em>in support of Favish rely on the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d before the word \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d to bolster their view that the family has no privacy interest in the pictures of the decedent.  This, too, misapprehends the family\xe2\x80\x99s position and the scope of protection the exemption provides.  The family does not invoke Exemption 7(C) on behalf of Vincent Foster in its capacity as his next friend for fear that the pictures may reveal private information about Foster to the detriment of his own posthumous reputation or some other interest personal to him.  If that were the case, a different set of considerations would control.  Foster\xe2\x80\x99s relatives instead invoke their own right and interest to personal privacy.  They seek to be shielded by the exemption to secure their own refuge from a sensation-seeking culture for their own peace of mind and tranquility, not for the sake of the deceased.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a sworn declaration filed with the District Court, Foster\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Sheila Foster Anthony, stated that the family had been harassed by, and deluged with requests from, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]olitical and commercial opportunists\xe2\x80\x9d who sought to profit from Foster\xe2\x80\x99s suicide.  App. 94.  In particular, she was \xe2\x80\x9chorrified and devastated by [a] photograph [already] leaked to the press.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheila Foster Anthony wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nightmares and heart-pounding insomnia as I visualize how he must have spent his last few minutes and seconds of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  She opposed the disclosure of the disputed pictures because \xe2\x80\x9cI fear that the release of [additional] photographs certainly would set off another round of intense scrutiny by the media.  Undoubtedly, the photographs would be placed on the Internet for world consumption.  Once again my family would be the focus of conceivably unsavory and distasteful media coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 95.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eleasing any photographs,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheila Foster Anthony continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwould constitute a painful unwarranted invasion of my privacy, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, my sister\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, and the privacy of Lisa Foster Moody (Vince\xe2\x80\x99s widow), her three children, and other members of the Foster family.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 93.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we shall explain below, we think it proper to conclude from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d that it intended to permit family members to assert their own privacy rights against public intrusions long deemed impermissible under the common law and in our cultural traditions.  This does not mean that the family is in the same position as the individual who is the subject of the disclosure.  We have little difficulty, however, in finding in our case law and traditions the right of family members to direct and control disposition of the body of the deceased and to limit attempts to exploit pictures of the deceased family member\xe2\x80\x99s remains for public purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Burial rites or their counterparts have been respected in almost all civilizations from time immemorial.  See generally 26 Encyclopaedia Britannica 851 (15th ed. 1985) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ritual burial of the dead\xe2\x80\x9d has been practiced \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the very dawn of human culture and \xe2\x80\xa6 in most parts of the world\xe2\x80\x9d); 5 Encyclopedia of Religion 450 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]uneral rites \xe2\x80\xa6 are the conscious cultural forms of one of our most ancient, universal, and unconscious impulses\xe2\x80\x9d).  They are a sign of the respect a society shows for the deceased and for the surviving family members.  The power of Sophocles\xe2\x80\x99 story in Antigone maintains its hold to this day because of the universal acceptance of the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s right to insist on respect for the body of her brother.  See Antigone of Sophocles, 8 Harvard Classics:  Nine Greek Dramas 255 (C. Eliot ed. 1909).  The outrage at seeing the bodies of American soldiers mutilated and dragged through the streets is but a modern instance of the same understanding of the interests decent people have for those whom they have lost.  Family members have a personal stake in honoring and mourning their dead and objecting to unwarranted public exploitation that, by intruding upon their own grief, tends to degrade the rites and respect they seek to accord to the deceased person who was once their own.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition this well-established cultural tradition acknowledging a family\xe2\x80\x99s control over the body and death images of the deceased has long been recognized at common law.  Indeed, this right to privacy has much deeper roots in the common law than the rap sheets held to be protected from disclosure in <em>Reporters Committee</em>.  An early decision by the New York Court of Appeals is typical:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the right of privacy of the living which it is sought to enforce here.  That right may in some cases be itself violated by improperly interfering with the character or memory of a deceased relative, but it is the right of the living, and not that of the dead, which is recognized.  A privilege may be given the surviving relatives of a deceased person to protect his memory, but the privilege exists for the benefit of the living, to protect their feelings, and to prevent a violation of their own rights in the character and memory of the deceased.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schuyler </em>v. <em>Curtis</em>, 147 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 434, 447, 42 N.\xc2\xa0E. 22, 25 (1895).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also<em> Reid</em> v. <em>Pierce County</em>, 136 Wash. 2d 195, 212, 961 P.\xc2\xa02d 333, 342 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he immediate relatives of a decedent have a protectable privacy interest in the autopsy records of the deceased\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>McCambridge</em> v. <em>Little Rock</em>, 298 Ark. 219, 231\xe2\x80\x93232, 766 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 909, 915 (1989) (recognizing the privacy interest of the murder victim\xe2\x80\x99s mother in crime scene photographs); <em>Bazemore</em> v. <em>Savannah Hospital</em>, 171 Ga. 257, 155 S.\xc2\xa0E. 194 (1930) <em>(per curiam) </em>(recognizing parents\xe2\x80\x99 right of privacy in photographs of their deceased child\xe2\x80\x99s body); Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7652D, p.\xc2\xa0387 (1977) (recognizing that publication of a photograph of a deceased infant\xe2\x80\x94a hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9cchild with two heads\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94over the objection of the mother would result in an \xe2\x80\x9cinva[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can assume Congress legislated against this background of law, scholarship, and history when it enacted FOIA and when it amended Exemption 7(C) to extend its terms.  Those enactments were also against the background of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s consistent interpretation of the exemption to protect \xe2\x80\x9cmembers of the family of the person to whom the information pertains,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Dept. of Justice, Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum on the Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act 36 (June 1967), and to require consideration of the privacy of \xe2\x80\x9crelatives or descendants\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpossible adverse effects [from disclosure] upon [the individual] or his family,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Dept. of Justice Memorandum on the 1974 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act<em> </em>9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Feb. 1975), reprinted in House Committee on Government Operations and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93\xe2\x80\x93502), Source Book, App. 5, pp. 519\xe2\x80\x93520, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (Joint Comm. Print. 1975).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have observed that the statutory privacy right protected by Exemption 7(C) goes beyond the common law and the Constitution.  See <em>Reporters Committee</em>, 489 U. S., at 762, n.\xc2\xa013 (contrasting the scope of the privacy protection under FOIA with the analogous protection under the common law and the Constitution); see also<em> Marzen </em>v. <em>Department of Health and Human Servs.,</em> 825 F.\xc2\xa02d 1148, 1152 (CA7 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he privacy interest protected under FOIA extends beyond the common law\xe2\x80\x9d).  It would be anomalous to hold in the instant case that the statute provides even less protection than does the common law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory scheme must be understood, moreover, in light of the consequences that would follow were we to adopt Favish\xe2\x80\x99s position.  As a general rule, withholding information under FOIA cannot be predicated on the identity of the requester.  See <em>Reporters Committee, supra,</em> at 771.  We are advised by the Government that child molesters, rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals often make FOIA requests for autopsies, photographs, and records of their deceased victims.  Our holding ensures that the privacy interests of surviving family members would allow the Government to deny these gruesome requests in appropriate cases.  We find it inconceivable that Congress could have intended a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal privacy\xe2\x80\x9d so narrow that it would allow convicted felons to obtain these materials without limitations at the expense of surviving family members\xe2\x80\x99 personal privacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, in agreement with the Courts of Appeals for both the District of Columbia and the Ninth Circuit, see<em> Accuracy in Media </em>v. <em>National Park Serv.</em>, 194 F.\xc2\xa03d 120 (CADC 1999); 217 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168 (CA9 2000), we hold that FOIA recognizes surviving family members\xe2\x80\x99 right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative\xe2\x80\x99s death-scene images.  Our holding is consistent with the unanimous view of the Courts of Appeals and other lower courts that have addressed the question.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>National Aeronautics and Space Admin.</em>, 782 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 628, 631, 632 (CADC 1991) (sustaining a privacy claim under the narrower Exemption 6 with respect to an audiotape of the Space Shuttle Challenger astronauts\xe2\x80\x99 last words, because \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xposure to the voice of a beloved family member immediately prior to that family member\xe2\x80\x99s death\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0would cause the Challenger families pain\xe2\x80\x9d and inflict \xe2\x80\x9ca disruption [to] their peace of mind every time a portion of the tape is played within the hearing\xe2\x80\x9d), on remand from 920 F.\xc2\xa02d 1002 (CADC 1990); <em>Katz</em> v. <em>National Archives and Records Admin.</em>, 862 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 476, 485 (DC 1994) (exempting from FOIA disclosure autopsy X-rays and photographs of President Kennedy on the ground that their release would cause \xe2\x80\x9cadditional anguish\xe2\x80\x9d to the surviving family), aff\xe2\x80\x99d on other grounds, 68 F.\xc2\xa03d 1438 (CADC 1995); <em>Lesar</em> v. <em>Department of Justice</em>, 636 F.\xc2\xa02d 472, 487 (CADC 1980) (recognizing, with respect to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., his survivors\xe2\x80\x99 privacy interests in avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cannoyance or harassment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Neither the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s former status as a public official, nor the fact that other pictures had been made public, detracts from the weighty privacy interests involved.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our ruling that the personal privacy protected by Exemption 7(C) extends to family members who object to the disclosure of graphic details surrounding their relative\xe2\x80\x99s death does not end the case.  Although this privacy interest is within the terms of the exemption, the statute directs nondisclosure only where the information \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\xe2\x80\x9d of the family\xe2\x80\x99s personal privacy.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted\xe2\x80\x9d requires us to balance the family\xe2\x80\x99s privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.  See <em>Reporters Committee</em>, 489 U. S., at 762.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FOIA is often explained as a means for citizens to know \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the Government is up to.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 773.  This phrase should not be dismissed as a convenient formalism.  It defines a structural necessity in a real democracy.  The statement confirms that, as a general rule, when documents are within FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure provisions, citizens should not be required to explain why they seek the information.  A person requesting the information needs no preconceived idea of the uses the data might serve.  The information belongs to citizens to do with as they choose.  Furthermore, as we have noted, the disclosure does not depend on the identity of the requester.  As a general rule, if the information is subject to disclosure, it belongs to all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When disclosure touches upon certain areas defined in the exemptions, however, the statute recognizes limitations that compete with the general interest in disclosure, and that, in appropriate cases, can overcome it.  In the case of Exemption 7(C), the statute requires us to protect, in the proper degree, the personal privacy of citizens against the uncontrolled release of information compiled through the power of the state.  The statutory direction that the information not be released if the invasion of personal privacy could reasonably be expected to be unwarranted requires the courts to balance the competing interests in privacy and disclosure.  To effect this balance and to give practical meaning to the exemption, the usual rule that the citizen need not offer a reason for requesting the information must be inapplicable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where the privacy concerns addressed by Exemption 7(C) are present, the exemption requires the person requesting the information to establish a sufficient reason for the disclosure.  First, the citizen must show that the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake.  Second, the citizen must show the information is likely to advance that interest.  Otherwise, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not in this single decision attempt to define the reasons that will suffice, or the necessary nexus between the requested information and the asserted public interest that would be advanced by disclosure.  On the other hand, there must be some stability with respect to both the specific category of personal privacy interests protected by the statute and the specific category of public interests that could outweigh the privacy claim.  Otherwise, courts will be left to balance in an ad\xc2\xa0hoc manner with little or no real guidance.  <em>Id.,</em> at 776.  In the case of photographic images and other data pertaining to an individual who died under mysterious circumstances, the justification most likely to satisfy Exemption 7(C)\xe2\x80\x99s public interest requirement is that the information is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the family has a privacy interest protected by the statute and to recognize as significant the asserted public interest in uncovering deficiencies or misfeasance in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s investigations into Foster\xe2\x80\x99s death.  It erred, however, in defining the showing Favish must make to substantiate his public interest claim.  It stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the statutory command conditions [disclosure] on the requesting party showing that he has knowledge of misfeasance by the agency\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the statutory command shields an agency from disclosing its records because other agencies have engaged in similar investigations.\xe2\x80\x9d  217 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1172\xe2\x80\x931173.  The court went on to hold that, because Favish has \xe2\x80\x9ctender[ed] evidence and argument which, if believed, would justify his doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d the FOIA request \xe2\x80\x9cis in complete conformity with the statutory purpose that the public know what its government is up to.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1173.  This was insufficient.  The Court of Appeals required no particular showing that any evidence points with credibility to some actual misfeasance or other impropriety.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s holding leaves Exemption 7(C) with little force or content.  By requiring courts to engage in a state of suspended disbelief with regard to even the most incredible allegations, the panel transformed Exemption 7(C) into nothing more than a rule of pleading.  The invasion of privacy under its rationale would be extensive.  It must be remembered that once there is disclosure, the information belongs to the general public.  There is no mechanism under FOIA for a protective order allowing only the requester to see whether the information bears out his theory, or for proscribing its general dissemination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that, where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.  Rather, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.  In <em>Department of State</em> v. <em>Ray,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/164/index.html">502 U. S. 164</a> (1991), we held there is a presumption of legitimacy accorded to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s official conduct.  <em>Id.,</em> at 178\xe2\x80\x93179.  The presumption perhaps is less a rule of evidence than a general working principle.  However the rule is characterized, where the presumption is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Armstrong,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/456/index.html">517 U. S. 456</a>, 464 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]n the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [Government agents] have properly discharged their official duties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Chemical Foundation, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/1/index.html">272 U. S. 1</a>, 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (1926) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s prodisclosure purpose, however, the less stringent standard we adopt today is more faithful to the statutory scheme.  Only when the FOIA requester has produced evidence sufficient to satisfy this standard will there exist a counterweight on the FOIA scale for the court to balance against the cognizable privacy interests in the requested records.  Allegations of government misconduct are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98easy to allege and hard to disprove,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crawford-El</em> v. <em>Britton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/574/index.html">523 U. S. 574</a>, 585 (1998), so courts must insist on a meaningful evidentiary showing.  It would be quite extraordinary to say we must ignore the fact that five different inquiries into the Foster matter reached the same conclusion.  As we have noted, the balancing exercise in some other case might require us to make a somewhat more precise determination regarding the significance of the public interest and the historical importance of the events in question.  We might need to consider the nexus required between the requested documents and the purported public interest served by disclosure.  We need not do so here, however.  Favish has not produced any evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred to put the balance into play.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in its interpretation of Exemption 7(C).  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s first order in March 1998\xe2\x80\x94before its decision was set aside by the Court of Appeals and superseded by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s own order on remand\xe2\x80\x94followed the correct approach.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to grant OIC\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment with respect to the four photographs in dispute.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
