He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated, with life-threatening consequences.  Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, to be \xe2\x80\x9cconclusory,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  198 Fed. Appx. 694, 698 (2006).  The holding departs in so stark a manner from the pleading standard mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we grant review.  We vacate the court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case for further consideration. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Facility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials.  After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving, petitioner sued under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, complaining, <em>inter alia</em>, that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.  See,<em> e.g</em>., <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Gamble</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/97/index.html">429 U. S. 97</a>, 104\xe2\x80\x93105 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d and this includes \xe2\x80\x9cindifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed\xe2\x80\x9d (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <em>Helling</em> v. <em>McKinney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/25/index.html">509 U. S. 25</a>, 35\xe2\x80\x9337 (1993). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner based his claim on the following allegations, which we assume to be true for purposes of review here:  Officials at Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Corrections (Department) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for hepatitis C.  After completing the necessary classes and otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the Department, petitioner began treatment for the disease.  The treatment, which would take a year to complete, involved weekly self-injections of medication by use of a syringe.  Soon after petitioner began this treatment, prison officials were unable to account for one of the syringes made available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for medical purposes.  Upon searching, they found it in a communal trash can, modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of illegal drugs.  Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action No. 05\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300405\xe2\x80\x93LTB\xe2\x80\x93MJW (D. Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prison officials, disbelieving petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct constituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia.  Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. 30, 2004), attached to Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint.  This conduct, according to the officials, led to the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable inference\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner had intended to use drugs, so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C treatment.  <em>Ibid</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe successful treatment of Hepatitis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance of recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d they indicated, <em>ibid</em>., an explanation they later offered to defend against petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. 05\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300405\xe2\x80\x93LTB\xe2\x80\x93MJW, p. 10.  Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs, the prison\xe2\x80\x99s protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months.  Brief in Opposition 4.  Petitioner therefore could face a delay of some 18 months before he would be able to restart treatment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor had \xe2\x80\x9cremoved [him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of department protocol, \xe2\x80\x9cthus endangering [his] life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint 2.  Petitioner attached to the complaint certain grievance forms.  In these he claimed, among other things, he was suffering from \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued damage to [his] liver\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of the nontreatment.  Colorado Dept. of Corrections Offender Grievance Form (June 30, 2004).  The complaint requested relief including damages and an injunction requiring that the Department treat petitioner for hepatitis C \xe2\x80\x9cunder the standards of the treatment [protocol] established by [the Department].\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three months after filing his complaint, and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him, petitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger, in Civ. Action No. 05\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x93405 (MJW) (D.\xc2\xa0Colo.).  Indicating it was \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed\xe2\x80\x9d that he had hepatitis C, that he met the Department\xe2\x80\x99s standards for treatment of the disease, and that \xe2\x80\x9cfurtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his] liver and possible death,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous inmates\xe2\x80\x9d in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was \xe2\x80\x9cin imminent danger\xe2\x80\x9d himself \xe2\x80\x9cdue to [the Department\xe2\x80\x99s] refusal to treat him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  He had identified similar allegations in an earlier filing, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9chis liver is suffering irreversible damage\xe2\x80\x9d due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he \xe2\x80\x9cwill suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s Objections to the Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s Recommendations in Civ. Action No. 05\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300405\xe2\x80\x93LTB\xe2\x80\x93MJW, p. 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents answered these filings with a motion to dismiss.  The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant, that the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it failed to allege Dr. Bloor\xe2\x80\x99s actions had caused petitioner \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Recommendation on Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Motion To Dismiss, p. 12.  The District Court issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It quoted extensively from the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial harm\xe2\x80\x9d before holding that petitioner had made \xe2\x80\x9conly conclusory allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the [hepatitis C] treatment program.\xe2\x80\x9d  198 Fed. Appx., at <font caps="1">698.  Acknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved \xe2\x80\x9clife-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s medical problems\xe2\x80\x9d (and that have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cprotects against future harm to an inmate\xe2\x80\x9d),<em> id</em>., at 697 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint deficient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed to \xe2\x80\x9callege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone substantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently culpable state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 697, 698 (internal quotation marks omitted).</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may in the final analysis be shown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss.  That is not the issue here, however.  It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question, concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading purposes that petitioner had suffered \xe2\x80\x9ca cognizable independent harm\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment program.  <em>Id</em>., at 698.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, 550  U.

In addition, when ruling on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.  <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (citing <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.

S. 232</a>, 236 (1974)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The complaint stated that Dr. Bloor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was \xe2\x80\x9cendangering [his] life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint 2.  It alleged this medication was withheld \xe2\x80\x9cshortly after\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner had commenced a treatment program that would take one year, that he was \xe2\x80\x9cstill in need of treatment for this disease,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the prison officials were in the meantime refusing to provide treatment.  <em>Id</em>., at 3, 4.  This alone was enough to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2).  Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his claim by making more specific allegations in documents attached to the complaint and in later filings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 departure from the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has been proceeding, from the litigation\xe2\x80\x99s outset, without counsel.  A document filed <em>pro se</em> is \xe2\x80\x9cto be liberally construed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Estelle</em>, 429 U. S., at 106, and \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>pro se </em>complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is sufficient in all respects is a matter yet to be determined, for respondents raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss.  In particular, the proper application of the controlling legal principles to the facts is yet to be determined.  The case cannot, however, be dismissed on the ground that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue.  Certiorari and leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.  </p>\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962504">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n551 U.
