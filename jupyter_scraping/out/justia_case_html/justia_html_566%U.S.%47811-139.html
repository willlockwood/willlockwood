The 3-year period is extended to 6 years, however, when a taxpayer \xe2\x80\x9comits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  The question before us is whether this latter provision applies (and extends the ordinary 3-year limitations period) when the taxpayer overstates his basis in property that he has sold, thereby understating the gain that he received from its sale.  Following Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, \n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 28 (1958)\n, we hold that the provision does not apply to an overstatement of basis.  Hence the 6-year period does not apply.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor present purposes the relevant underlying circumstances are not in dispute.  We consequently assume that (1) the respondent taxpayers filed their relevant tax returns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis of certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a result the returns understated the gross income that the taxpayers received from the sale of the property; and (4)\xc2\xa0the understatement exceeded the statute\xe2\x80\x99s 25% threshold.  We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner asserted the relevant deficiency within the extended 6-year limitations period, but outside the default 3-year period.  Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations applies, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to assert a tax deficiency came too late.  Our conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that the extended limitations period does not apply\xe2\x80\x94follows directly from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier decision in Colony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the In- ternal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of which is identical to the language now before us.  The Commissioner there had determined\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cthat the taxpayer had understated the gross profits on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the \xe2\x80\x98basis\xe2\x80\x99 of such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain unallowable items of development expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 30.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s assessment came after the ordinary 3-year limitations period had run.  And, it was consequently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the 1939 Code, had \xe2\x80\x9comit[ted] from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per cen- tum of the amount of gross income stated in the return .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7275(c) (1940 ed.).  The Code provision ap- plicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially indistinguishable language.  See \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.) (same, but replacing \xe2\x80\x9cper centum\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cpercent\xe2\x80\x9d).

But the Court recognized the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s contrary argument for inclusion.  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.  Then as now, the Code itself defined \xe2\x80\x9cgross income\xe2\x80\x9d in this context as the difference between gross revenue (often the amount the taxpayer received upon selling the prop- erty) and basis (often the amount the taxpayer paid for the property).  Compare 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722, 111 (1940 ed.) with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa761(a)(3), 1001(a) (2000 ed.).  And, the Commissioner pointed out, an overstatement of basis can diminish the \xe2\x80\x9camount\xe2\x80\x9d of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off the return might do.  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.  Either way, the error wrongly understates the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s income.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut, the Court added, the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument did not fully account for the provision\xe2\x80\x99s language, in particular the word \xe2\x80\x9comit.\xe2\x80\x9d  The key phrase says \xe2\x80\x9comits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9comits\xe2\x80\x9d (unlike, say, \xe2\x80\x9creduces\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cun- derstates\xe2\x80\x9d) means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]o leave out or unmentioned; not to insert, include, or name.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1939)).  Thus, taken literally, \xe2\x80\x9comit\xe2\x80\x9d limits the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope to situations in which specific receipts or accruals of income are left out of the computation of gross income; to inflate the basis, however, is not to \xe2\x80\x9comit\xe2\x80\x9d a specific item, not even of profit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile finding this latter interpretation of the language the \xe2\x80\x9cmore plausibl[e],\xe2\x80\x9d the Court also noted that the language was not \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colony, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33.

It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to give the same language here a different interpretation without effectively overruling Colony, a course of action that basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not to take.

It suggests that these differences counsel in favor of a different interpretation than the one adopted in Colony.  For example, the Government points to a new provision, \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of a trade or business, the term \xe2\x80\x98gross income\xe2\x80\x99 means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services (if such amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tIf the section\xe2\x80\x99s basic phrase \xe2\x80\x9comi[ssion] from gross income\xe2\x80\x9d does not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what Colony held), then what need would there be for clause (i), which leads to the same result in a specific subset of cases?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph, referring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who \xe2\x80\x9comits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. items includible in [the] gross estate\xe2\x80\x9d?  See \xc2\xa76501(e)(2) (emphasis added).  By speaking of \xe2\x80\x9citems\xe2\x80\x9d there does it not imply that omission of an \xe2\x80\x9camount\xe2\x80\x9d cov- ers more than omission of individual items\xe2\x80\x94indeed that it includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, di- minish the amount of the profit that should have been re- ported as gross income?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn our view, these points are too fragile to bear the sig- nificant argumentative weight the Government seeks to place upon them.  For example, at least one plausible reason why Congress might have added clause (i) has nothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the general rule.  Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code (prior to Colony), it did not yet know how the Court would interpret the provision\xe2\x80\x99s operative language.  At least one lower court had decided that the provision did not apply to overstatements about the cost of goods that a business later sold.  See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F.\xc2\xa02d 570 (CA3 1953).  But see Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F.\xc2\xa02d 900, 902\xe2\x80\x93903 (CA6 1944).  And Congress could well have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the Supreme Court, Uptegrove\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would remain the law where a \xe2\x80\x9ctrade or business\xe2\x80\x9d was at issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without work to do.  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19, \n31 (2001)\n (noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That provision also explains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of determining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25% of \xe2\x80\x9cgross income.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, it tells us that a merchant who fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods has not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than $40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to acquire those goods.  But without clause (i), the general statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cgross income\xe2\x80\x9d requires subtracting the cost from the sales price.  See 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa761(a)(3), 1012.  Under such a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cgross income,\xe2\x80\x9d the cal- culation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000, minus (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of such sales,\xe2\x80\x9d say, $25,000.  The $10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the \xe2\x80\x9cgross income\xe2\x80\x9d of $15,000.  And the clause does this work in respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of our interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument about subsection (e)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9citem\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9camount\xe2\x80\x9d is yet weaker.  The Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about the word \xe2\x80\x9camount.\xe2\x80\x9d  It wrote:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Commissioner states that the draftsman\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x98amount\xe2\x80\x99 (instead of, for example, \xe2\x80\x98item\xe2\x80\x99) suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of the error\xe2\x80\x94that is whether or not gross income was understated by as much as 25%.\xe2\x80\x9d  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tBut the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s logic, rejected the argument (and the significance of the word \xe2\x80\x9camount\xe2\x80\x9d) as insufficient to prove the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  And the addition of the word \xe2\x80\x9citem\xe2\x80\x9d in a different subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive force sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion.  The word\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new.  But to rely in the case before us on this solitary word change in a different subsection is like hoping that a new batboy will change the outcome of the World Series.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931, which was promulgated in final form in December 2010.  See 26 CFR \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931 (2011).  The regulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and interprets the operative language of the statute in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The regulation says that \xe2\x80\x9can un- derstated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931(a)(1)(iii).  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view this new regulation in effect overturns Colony\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of this statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government points out that the Treasury Regulation constitutes \xe2\x80\x9can agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statute which it administers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron, U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

United States, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011) (applying Chevron in the tax context).  The Court has written that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x99s prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v.

And, as the Government notes, in Colony itself the Court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be said that the language is unambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33.  Hence, the Government concludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case.  The question, rather, is whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction is a \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron, supra, at 843.  And, since the Government argues that the regulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible, construction of the statute, the Government believes it must win.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not accept this argument.

The Court reveals that reason when it points out that \xe2\x80\x9cit is for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The fact that a statute is unambiguous means that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno gap for the agency to fill\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cno room for agency discre- tion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 982\xe2\x80\x93983.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn so stating, the Court sought to encapsulate what earlier opinions, including Chevron, made clear.  Those opinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as that of deciding whether, or when, a particular statute in effect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap, thereby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a reasonable gap-filling interpretation.  Thus, in Chevron the Court said that, when\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cCongress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.  [But in either instance], a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tSee also United States v.

Thus, in Chevron the Court wrote that a statute\xe2\x80\x99s silence or ambiguity as to a particular issue means that Congress has not \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly addressed the precise question at issue\xe2\x80\x9d (thus likely delegating gap-filling power to the agency).  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 843.  In Mead the Court, describing Chevron, explained:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cCongress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tChevron added that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 843, n.\xc2\xa09 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Government points out, the Court in Colony stated that the statutory language at issue is not \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33.  But the Court decided that case nearly 30 years before it decided Chevron.  There is no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap-filling power to the agency.  At the same time, there is every reason to believe that the Court thought that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly spoken to the question at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus left \xe2\x80\x9c[no] gap for the agency to fill.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron, supra, at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, the Court said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument.  Colony, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33.  For another, its examination of legislative history led it to believe that Congress had decided the question definitively, leaving no room for the agency to reach a contrary result.  It found in that history \xe2\x80\x9cpersuasive indications\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope, and it said that it was satisfied that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended an exception .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. only in the restricted type of situation\xe2\x80\x9d it had already described.  Id., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  Further, it thought that the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s inter- pretation (the interpretation once again advanced here) would \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a patent incongruity in the tax law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  And it reached this conclusion despite the fact that, in the years leading up to Colony, the Commissioner had consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit courts.  See, e.g., Uptegrove, 204 F.\xc2\xa02d 570; Reis, 142 F.\xc2\xa02d 900; Goodenow v. Commisioner, 238 F.\xc2\xa02d 20 (CA8 1956); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T.\xc2\xa0C. 386 (1942).  Cf. Slaff v. Commisioner, 220 F.\xc2\xa02d 65 (CA9 1955); Davis v. Hightower, 230 F.\xc2\xa02d 549 (CA5 1956).  Thus, the Court was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  And finally, after completing its analysis, Colony found its interpretation of the 1939 Code \xe2\x80\x9cin harmony with the [now] unambiguous language\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests that the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as inconsistent with its conclusion.  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 37.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt may be that judges today would use other methods to determine whether Congress left a gap to fill.  But that is beside the point.  The question is whether the Court in Colony concluded that the statute left such a gap.  And, in our view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the Court) makes clear that it did not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven principles of stare decisis, we must follow that interpretation.

We agree with the taxpayer that overstatements of basis, and the resulting understatement of gross income, do not trigger the extended limitations period of \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A).

See 26 CFR \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931 (2011).  In my view, that cannot be: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce a court has decided upon its de novo construction of the statute, there no longer is a different construction that is consistent with the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding and available for adoption by the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967\n, n.\xc2\xa012 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  That view, of course, did not carry the day in Brand X, and the Government quite reasonably relies on the Brand X majority\xe2\x80\x99s innovative pronouncement that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x99s prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 982.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn cases decided pre-Brand X, the Court had no inkling that it must utter the magic words \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cun- ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d in order to (poof!) expand or abridge execu- tive power, and (poof!) enable or disable administrative contradiction of the Supreme Court.  Indeed, the Court was unaware of even the utility (much less the necessity) of making the ambiguous/nonambiguous determination in cases decided pre-Chevron, before that opinion made the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cStep 1\xe2\x80\x9d determination of ambiguity vel\xc2\xa0non a customary (though hardly mandatory\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t) part of judicial-review analysis.  For many of those earlier cases, therefore, it will be incredibly difficult to determine whether the decision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous, or rather an unambiguous, statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, one would have thought that the Brand X major- ity would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case, in- volving a pre-Chevron opinion that (mirabile dictu) makes it inescapably clear that the Court thought the statute ambiguous: \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be said that the language is unambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colony, supra, at 33 (emphasis added).  As today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality opinion explains, Colony \xe2\x80\x9csaid that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10 (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94not what Brand X requires to foreclose administrative revision of our decisions: \xe2\x80\x9cthe only permissible reading of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 984.  Thus, having decided to stand by Colony and to stand by Brand X as well, the plurality should have found\xe2\x80\x94in order to reach the decision it did\xe2\x80\x94that the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s current interpretation was unreasonable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInstead of doing what Brand X would require, however, the plurality manages to sustain the justifiable reliance of taxpayers by revising yet again the meaning of Chevron\xe2\x80\x94and revising it yet again in a direction that will create confusion and uncertainty.  See United States v. Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93246 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review of Agency Action, 58 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1443, 1457\xe2\x80\x931475 (2005).  Of course there is no doubt that, with regard to the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department satisfies the Mead requirement of some indication \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  We have given Chevron deference to a Treasury Regulation before.  See Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).  But in order to evade Brand X and yet reaffirm Colony, the plurality would add yet another lop-sided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our law of administrative review has become: To trigger the Brand X power of an authorized \xe2\x80\x9cgap-filling\xe2\x80\x9d agency to give content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determination that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice; the pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that Congress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to be resolved by the agency.  And here, today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality opinion finds, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap-filling power to the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  The notion, seemingly, is that post-Chevron a finding of ambiguity is accompanied by a finding of agency authority to resolve the ambiguity, but pre-Chevron that was not so.  The premise is false.  Post-Chevron cases do not \xe2\x80\x9cconclude\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved by the agency; that is simply the legal effect of ambi- guity\xe2\x80\x94a legal effect that should obtain whenever the language is in fact (as Colony found) ambiguous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDoes the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to Colony\xe2\x80\x99s determination of ambiguity because the Court did not know, in that era, the importance of that determination\xe2\x80\x94that it would empower the agency to (in effect) revise the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of statutory meaning?  But as I suggested earlier, that was an ignorance which all of our cases shared not just pre-Chevron, but pre-Brand X.  Before then it did not really matter whether the Court was resolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear meaning.  The opinion might (or might not) advert to that point in the course of its analysis, but either way the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute would be the law.  So it is no small number of still-authoritative cases that today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality opinion would exile to the Land of Uncertainty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach, the plurality opinion then pivots (as the \xc3\xa0 la mode vernacular has it)\xe2\x80\x94from focusing on whether Colony concluded that there was gap-filling authority to focusing on whether Colony concluded that there was any gap to be filled: \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is whether the Court in Colony concluded that the statute left such a gap.  And, in our view, the opinion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. makes clear that it did not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  How does the plurality know this?  Because Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion \xe2\x80\x9csaid that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument\xe2\x80\x9d; because it found that legislative history indicated \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope\xe2\x80\x9d; because it concluded that the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a patent incongruity in the tax law\xe2\x80\x9d; and because it found its interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cin harmony with the [now] unambiguous language\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1954 Code.  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But these are the sorts of arguments that courts always use in resolving ambiguities.  They do not prove that no ambiguity existed, unless one believes that an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never existed in the first place.  Colony said unambiguously that the text was ambiguous, and that should be an end of the matter\xe2\x80\x94unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis effect to Colony as a pre-Chevron decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRather than making our judicial-review jurisprudence curiouser and curiouser, the Court should abandon the opinion that produces these contortions, Brand X.  I join the judgment announced by the Court because it is indisputable that Colony resolved the construction of the statutory language at issue here, and that construction must therefore control.

This passage is reminiscent of Professor K.\xc2\xa0C. Davis\xe2\x80\x99s vision that administrative procedure is developed by \xe2\x80\x9ca partnership between legislators and judges,\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cworking [as] partners produce better law than legislators alone could possibly produce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That romantic, judge-empowering image was obliterated by this Court in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519 (1978)\n, which held that Congress prescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the administrative procedures that Congress has created.  It seems to me that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s vision of a troika partnership (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage.  The discourse, conversation, and exchange that the dissent perceives is peculiarly one-sided.  Congress prescribes; and where Congress\xe2\x80\x99s prescription is ambiguous the Executive can (within the scope of the ambiguity) clarify that prescription; and if the product is constitutional the courts obey.  I hardly think it amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscourse\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress or (as this Court would allow in its Brand X decision) the Executive can change its prescription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.  What is needed for the system to work is that Congress, the Executive, and the private parties subject to their dispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts will give to their instructions.  That goal would be obstructed if the judicially established meaning of a technical legal term used in a very specific context could be overturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble as those asserted here.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStep 1\xe2\x80\x9d has never been an essential part of Chevron analysis.

See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The Treasury Department has determined that taxpayers omit income under this section not only when they fail to report a sale of property but also when they overstate their basis in the property sold.  See Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931, 26 CFR \xc2\xa7301.6501(e)\xe2\x80\x931 (2011).  The question is whether this otherwise reasonable interpretation is foreclosed by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading of an earlier version of the statute in Colony, Inc. v.

Although the main text of the statute remained the same, Congress added new provisions leading to the permissible conclusion that it would have a different meaning going forward.  The Colony decision reserved judgment on this issue.  In my view, the amended statute leaves room for the Department\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  A summary of the reasons for concluding the Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is permissible, and for this respectful dissent, now follows.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe statute at issue in Colony, \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7275(c) (1940 ed.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.  It provided for a longer period of limitations if the Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer who had \xe2\x80\x9comit[ted] from gross income an amount .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere was disagreement in the courts about the meaning of this provision in the statute as first enacted.  The Tax Court of the United States, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an overstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross income and could trigger the extended limitations period.  See, e.g., Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F.\xc2\xa02d 900, 902\xe2\x80\x93903 (1944); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T.\xc2\xa0C. 386 (1942).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case where a corporation misreported its income after inflating the cost of goods it sold from inventory.  See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F.\xc2\xa02d 570, 571\xe2\x80\x93573 (1953).  In the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view there could be an omission only where the taxpayer had left an entire \xe2\x80\x9citem of gain out of his computation of gross income.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 571.  In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court resolved that dispute against the Government.  Acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be said that the language is unambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33, and relying in large part on the legislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded that the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an omission from gross income under \xc2\xa7275(c).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the Government is to prevail in the instant case the regulation in question must be a proper implementation of the same language the Court considered in Colony; but the statutory interpretation issue here cannot be resolved, and the Colony decision cannot be deemed controlling, without first considering the inferences that should be drawn from added statutory text.  The additional language was not part of the statute that governed the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s liability in Colony, and the Court did not consider it in that case.  Congress revised the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, several years before Colony was decided but after the tax years in question in that case.  Although the interpretation adopted by the Court in Colony can be a proper beginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute, it ought not to be the end.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe central language of the new provision remained the same as the old, with the longer period of limitations still applicable where a taxpayer had \xe2\x80\x9comit[ted] from gross income an amount .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in excess of 25 per[cent] of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\xe2\x80\x9d  In Colony, however, the Court left open whether Congress had nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cmanifested an intention to clarify or to change the 1939 Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 37.  The 1954 revisions, of course, could not provide a direct response to Colony, which had not yet been decided.  But there were indications that, whatever the earlier version of the statute had meant, Congress expected that the overstatement of basis would be considered an omission from gross income as a general rule going forward.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, the new law created a special exception for businesses by defining their gross income to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services\xe2\x80\x9d without factoring in \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of such sales or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A)(i) (1958 ed.) (cur-rently \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)).  The prin-cipal purpose of this provision, perhaps motivated by the facts in the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s Uptegrove decision, seems to have been to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not be activated by a business\xe2\x80\x99s overstatement of the cost of goods sold.  This did important work.  There are, after all, unique complexities involved in calculating inventory costs.  See, e.g., O. Whittington &amp; K. Pany, Principles of Auditing and Other Assurance Services 488 (15th ed. 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe audit of inventories presents the auditors with significant risk because: (a) they often represent a very substantial portion of current assets, (b) numerous valuation methods are used for inventories, (c) the valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods sold, and (d) the determination of inventory quality, condition, and value is inherently complex\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Internal Revenue Service, Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods 17 (rev. Mar. 2008) (discussing methods for identifying the cost of items in inventory).  Congress sought fit to make clear that errors in these kinds of calculations would not extend the limitations period.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tColony itself might be classified as a special \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness inventory\xe2\x80\x9d case.  Unlike the taxpayers here, the taxpayer in Colony claimed to be a business with income from the sale of goods, though the \xe2\x80\x9cgoods\xe2\x80\x9d it held for sale were real estate lots.  See Intermountain Ins. Serv. of Vail v. Commissioner, 650 F.\xc2\xa03d 691, 703 (CADC 2011) (Tatel, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cColony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or business with income from the sale of goods or services\xe2\x80\x94i.e., as falling within [clause] (i)\xe2\x80\x99s scope had the subsection applied pre-1954 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court, in turn, observed that its construction of the pre-1954 statute in favor of the taxpayer was \xe2\x80\x9cin harmony with the unambiguous language of [newly enacted] \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 37.  Clause (i) of the new provision, as just noted, ensured that the extended limitations period would not cover overstated costs of goods sold.  The revised statute\xe2\x80\x99s special treatment of these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in other cases could have the effect of extending the limitations period.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also significant that, after 1954, the statute continued to address the omission of a substantial \xe2\x80\x9camount\xe2\x80\x9d that should have been included in gross income.  In the same round of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established an extended limitations period in certain cases where \xe2\x80\x9citems\xe2\x80\x9d had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(e)(2) (1958 ed.).  There is at least some evidence that this term was used at that time to \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] it clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the extended limitations period would not apply \xe2\x80\x9cmerely because of differences between the taxpayer and the Government as to the valuation of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, Summary of the New Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 130 (Comm. Print 1955).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to use the term \xe2\x80\x9citems\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve the same result when it reenacted the statutory provision at issue is presumed to have been purposeful.  See Russello v. United States, \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, \n23 (1983)\n.  This consideration casts further doubt on the premise that the new version of the statute, \xc2\xa76501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as its predecessor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the instant case the Court concludes these statutory changes are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the Government seeks to place upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5.  But in this context, the changes are meaningful.  Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version of the statute could not be described as unambiguous, al-though it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of basis was not an omission from gross income.  See 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33.  The statutory revisions, which were not considered in Colony, may not compel the opposite conclusion under the new statute; but they strongly favor it.  As a result, there was room for the Treasury Department to interpret the new provision in that manner.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93845 (1984).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn an earlier case, and in an unrelated controversy not implicating the Internal Revenue Code, the Court held that a judicial construction of an ambiguous statute did not foreclose an agency\xe2\x80\x99s later, inconsistent interpretation of the same provision.  National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967\n\xe2\x80\x93983 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill, displaces a conflicting agency construction\xe2\x80\x9d).  This general rule recognizes that filling gaps left by ambigu-ities in a statute \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 980.  There has been no opportunity to decide whether the analysis would be any different if an agency sought to interpret an ambiguous statute in a way that was inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s own, earlier reading of the law.  See id., at 1003 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese issues are not implicated here.  In Colony the Court did interpret the same phrase that must be interpreted in this case.  The language was in a predecessor statute, however, and Congress has added new language that, in my view, controls the analysis and should instruct the Court to reach a different outcome today.  The Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulations were promulgated in light of these statutory revisions, which were not at issue in Col-ony.  There is a serious difficulty to insisting, as the Court does today, that an ambiguous provision must continue to be read the same way even after it has been reenacted with additional language suggesting Congress would permit a different interpretation.  Agencies with the responsibility and expertise necessary to administer ongoing regulatory schemes should have the latitude and discretion to implement their interpretation of provisions reenacted in a new statutory framework.  And this is especially so when the new language enacted by Congress seems to favor the very interpretation at issue.  The approach taken by the Court instead forecloses later interpretations of a law that has changed in relevant ways.  Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n247 (2001)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cWorst of all, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach will lead to the ossification of large portions of our statutory law.  Where Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities remain am-biguities subject to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing clarification\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court goes too far, in my respectful view, in constricting Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability to leave agencies in charge of filling statutory gaps.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur legal system presumes there will be continuing dialogue among the three branches of Government on questions of statutory interpretation and application.  See Blakely v. Washington, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, \n326 (2004)\n (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cConstant, constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures is an integral and admirable part of the constitutional design\xe2\x80\x9d); Mistretta v. United States, \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361, \n408 (1989)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cOur principle of separation of powers anticipates that the coordinate Branches will converse with each other on matters of vital common interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  In some cases Congress will set out a general principle, to be administered in more detail by an agency in the exercise of its discretion.  The agency may be in a proper position to evaluate the best means of implementing the statute in its practical application.  Where the agency exceeds its authority, of course, courts must invalidate the regulation.  And agency interpretations that lead to unjust or unfair consequences can be corrected, much like disfavored judicial interpretations, by congressional action.  These instructive ex-changes would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new, relevant statutory amendments.  Courts instead should be open to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of a different interpretation where, as here, Congress has given new instruction by an amended statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the circumstances, the Treasury Department had authority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new tax provision at issue.  See Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. __, __ (2011) (slip op., at 10).  This was also the conclusion reached in well-reasoned opinions issued in several cases before the Courts of Appeals.  E.g., Intermountain, 650 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 705\xe2\x80\x93706 (reaching this conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the Court in Colony never purported to interpret [the new provision]; because [the new provision]\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98omits from gross income\xe2\x80\x99 text is at least ambiguous, if not best read to include overstatements of basis; and because neither the section\xe2\x80\x99s structure nor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Department\xe2\x80\x99s clarification of an ambiguous statute, applicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate settled expectations.  Given the statutory changes described above, taxpayers had reason to question whether Colony\xe2\x80\x99s holding extended to the revised \xc2\xa76501(e)(1).  See, e.g., CC &amp; F Western Operations L.\xc2\xa0P. v. Commissioner, 273 F.\xc2\xa03d 402, 406, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA1 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether Colony\xe2\x80\x99s main holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least doubtful\xe2\x80\x9d).  Having worked no change in the law, and instead having interpreted a statutory provision without an established meaning, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulation does not have an impermissible retroactive effect.  Cf. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A., \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735\n, n.\xc2\xa03 (1996) (rejecting retroactivity argument); Manhattan Gen. Equipment Co. v.
