The court\'s conclusion was based on its analysis of our decisions in <i>Bellotti </i>v. <i>Baird, supra, </i>and <i>Ohio </i>v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/502/case.html">497 U. S. 502</a> (1990).</p><p>In <i>Bellotti, </i>we struck down a statute requiring a minor to obtain the <i>consent </i>of both parents before having an abortion, subject to a judicial bypass provision, because the judicial bypass provision was too restrictive, unconstitutionally burdening a minor\'s right to an abortion. 443 U. S., at 647 (plurality opinion); <i>id., </i>at 655-656 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). The Court\'s principal opinion explained that a constitutional parental consent statute must contain a bypass provision that meets four criteria: (i) allow the minor to bypass the consent requirement if she establishes that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make the abortion decision independently; (ii) allow the minor to bypass the consent requirement if she establishes that the abortion would be in her best interests; (iii) ensure the minor\'s anonymity; and (iv) provide for expeditious bypass procedures. <i>Id., </i>at 643-644 (plurality opinion). See also <i>Akron, </i>497 U. S., at 511-513 (restating the four requirements).</p><p>In <i>Akron, </i>we upheld a statute requiring a minor to <i>notify </i>one parent before having an abortion, subject to a judicial bypass provision. We declined to decide whether a parental notification statute must include some sort of bypass provision to be constitutional. <i>Id., </i>at 510. Instead, we held that this bypass provision satisfied the four <i>Bellotti </i>criteria required for bypass provisions in parental <i>consent </i>statutes, and that <i>a fortiori </i>it satisfied any criteria that might be required for bypass provisions in parental notification statutes. Critically for the case now before us, the judicial bypass provision we examined in <i>Akron </i>was substantively indistinguishable from both the Montana judicial bypass provision at issue here and the Nevada provision at issue in <i>Glick. </i>See 497 U. S., at 508 (summarizing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2151.85 (1995)). The judicial bypass provision in <i>Akron </i>al-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="296">296</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>lowed a court to waive the notification requirement if it determined by clear and convincing evidence "that <i>notice </i>is not in [the minor\'s] best interests" (not that <i>an abortion </i>is in her best interests). 497 U. S., at 508 (emphasis added) (citing \xc2\xa7 2151.85(A)(4)). And we explicitly held that this provision satisfied the second <i>Bellotti </i>requirement, that "the procedure must allow the minor to show that, even if she cannot make the abortion decision by herself, \'the desired abortion would be in her best interests.\'" 497 U. S., at 511 (quoting <i>Bellotti, supra, </i>at 644).</p><p>Despite the fact that <i>Akron </i>involved a parental notification statute, and <i>Bellotti </i>involved a parental consent statute; 3 despite the fact that <i>Akron </i>involved a statute virtually identical to the Nevada statute at issue in <i>Glick; </i>and despite the fact that <i>Akron </i>explicitly held that the statute met all of the <i>Bellotti </i>requirements, the Ninth Circuit in <i>Glick </i>struck down Nevada\'s parental notification statute as inconsistent with <i>Bellotti:</i></p><blockquote><p>\n"Rather than requiring the reviewing court to consider the minor\'s \'best interests\' generally, the Nevada statute requires the consideration of "best interests" only with respect to the possible consequences of parental notification. The best interests of a minor female in obtaining an abortion may encompass far more than her interests in not notifying a parent of the abortion decision. Furthermore, in <i>Bellotti, </i>the court expressly stated, \'[i]f, <i>all things considered, </i>the court determines that an abortion is in the minor\'s best interests, she is entitled to court authorization without any parental involvement.\' <i>Bellotti, </i>443 U. S. at 648 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Nevada statute impermissibly narrows</p></blockquote><p>3 See <i>Bellotti, </i>443 U. S., at 654, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]his case [does not] determin[e] the constitutionality of a statute which does no more than require notice to the parents, without affording them or any other third party an absolute veto").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="297">297</a></p><blockquote><p>\nthe <i>Bellotti </i>\'best interests\' criterion, and is unconstitutional." 937 F. 2d, at 439.</p></blockquote><p>Based entirely on <i>Glick, </i>the Ninth Circuit in this case affirmed the District Court\'s ruling that the Montana statute is unconstitutional, since the statute allows waiver of the notification requirement only if the youth court determines that notification-not the abortion itself-is not in the minor\'s best interests. 93 F. 3d, at 572.</p><p>As should be evident from the foregoing, this decision simply cannot be squared with our decision in <i>Akron. </i>The Ohio parental notification statute at issue there was indistinguishable in any relevant way from the Montana statute at issue here. Both allow for judicial bypass if the minor shows that parental <i>notification </i>is not in her best interests. We asked in <i>Akron </i>whether this met the <i>Bellotti </i>requirement that the minor be allowed to show that "the desired abortion would be in her best interests." We explicitly held that it did. 497 U. S., at 511. Thus, the Montana statute meets this requirement, too. In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit was mistaken.</p><p>Respondents (as did the Ninth Circuit in <i>Glick) </i>place great emphasis on our statement in <i>Akron, </i>that "[t]he statute requires the juvenile court to authorize the minor\'s consent where the court determines that <i>the abortion </i>is in the minor\'s best interest." 497 U. S., at 511 (emphasis added) (citing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2151.85(C)(2) (Supp. 1988)). But since we had clearly stated that the statute actually required such authorization only when the court determined that <i>notification </i>would not be in the minor\'s best interests, it is wrong to take our statement to imply that the statute said otherwise. Rather, underlying our statement was an assumption that a judicial bypass procedure requiring a minor to show that <i>parental notification is not </i>in her best interests is equivalent to a judicial bypass procedure requiring a minor to show that <i>abortion without notification is </i>in her best in-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="298">298</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>terests, as the context of the opinion, the statutory language, and the concurring opinion all make clear.4</p><p>Respondents, echoing the Ninth Circuit in <i>Glick, </i>claim that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between requiring a minor to show that parental notification is not in her best interests, and requiring a minor to show that an abortion (without such notification) is in her best interests. See Brief in Opposition 12-13; 937 F. 2d, at 438-439. But the Montana statute draws no such distinction, and respondents cite no Montana state-court decision suggesting that the statute permits a court to separate the question whether parental notification is not in a minor\'s best interest from an inquiry into whether abortion (without notification) is in the minor\'s best interest. As with the Ohio statute in <i>Akron, </i>the challenge to the Montana statute here is a facial one. Under these circumstances, the Ninth Circuit was incorrect to assume that Montana\'s statute "narrow[edJ" the <i>Bellotti </i>test, 937 F. 2d, at 439, as interpreted in <i>Akron.</i></p><p>4 See 497 U.

S. 502</a> (1990) <i>(Akron II), </i>that a young woman\'s demonstration that an abortion would be in her best interest was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Ohio statute\'s judicial bypass provision. In my view, that case requires us to make the same assumption here. Whether that is a necessary showing is a question we need not reach.</p><p>In <i>Akron II, </i>we upheld a statute authorizing a judicial bypass of a parental notice requirement on the understanding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2151.85(C)(2) (1995) required the juvenile court to authorize the procedure whenever it determined that "the abortion is in the minor\'s best interest," 497 U. S., at 511. Given the fact that the relevant text of the Montana statute at issue in this case, Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 50-20-212(5)(b) (1995), is essentially identical to the Ohio provision, coupled with the fact that the Montana Attorney General has advised us that "the best interests standard in \xc2\xa7 50-20-212(5)(b) [is] either identical to or substantively indistinguishable from the best interests" provision construed in <i>Akron II, </i>Pet. for Cert. 7, it is surely appropriate to assume that the Montana provision also requires the court to authorize the minor\'s consent whenever the abortion is in her best interests. So understood, the Montana statute is plainly constitutional under our ruling in <i>Akron II. </i>Because the Court of Appeals erroneously construed the statute in a manner that caused that court to hold the statute unconstitutional, I agree with the majority that the judgment below should be reversed. *</p><p>*Our reading of the statute in <i>Akron II </i>appropriately recognized that the two inquiries at issue here-whether an abortion is in a young woman\'s best interest, and whether notifying a minor\'s parents of her desire to obtain an abortion is in her best interest-are sometimes linked. For example, if a judge finds after careful assessment of all the circumstances</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="302">302</a></p><p>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment</p><p>While a showing that an abortion is in a young woman\'s best interest is therefore sufficient to satisfy the Montana judicial bypass provision as we understood an analogous statute in <i>Akron II, </i>I do not think the Court need address whether the Montana statute can be properly understood to make such a demonstration a necessary requirement. My colleagues suggest that the statute requires a minor "to show that abortion without notification is in her best interests," <i>ante, </i>at 297-298 (emphasis deleted). To the extent this language indicates that a young woman must demonstrate <i>both </i>that abortion is in her best interest <i>and </i>that notification is not, I think that question is best left for another day. I note, however, that the plain language of the statute makes passably clear that a showing that notification is not in the minor\'s best interest is alone sufficient. See Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 50-20-212(5)(b) (1995) ("The court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to consent to an abortion without the notification of a parent ...  if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that ...  the notification of aparent ... is not in the best interests of the petitioner").</p><p>Although I therefore do not agree with all of the Court\'s reasoning, I concur in the majority\'s view that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.</p><p>that the abortion a young woman seeks would be in her best interest, and determines that notifying her parents is both opposed by the young woman and would likely cause her to be deterred from pursuing the treatment decision that would serve her best, then parental notification is assuredly not in her best interest. Under such circumstances, the proper course for the trial judge would be to permit the abortion without notification.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
