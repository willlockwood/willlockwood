S. 320</a></p><p> <em>Conemaugh</em> and the <em>New York.</em>  The only questions decided were as to the respective faults of the two vessels, and the claim of the underwriters upon the <em>Conemaugh\'s</em> cargo, that they were entitled to a recovery to the full amount of their damages against the <em>New York,</em> notwithstanding the <em>Conemaugh</em> was also in fault for the collision.  This claim was sustained, and directions given to enter a decree in conformity to the opinion of this Court.  Such decree was entered, dividing the damages between the two vessels, and awarding to the underwriters of the cargo a full recovery against the <em>New York.</em>  It may be true that the decree holds the <em>New York</em> liable for seventy-six percent of the entire damages, and not fifty percent, but this results from the fact that she was primarily held for the entire value of the cargo.  The equal division applied only to the vessels, and, upon the other hand, if petitioner be entitled to the recoupment claimed, it would apparently result in an affirmative decree in its favor.  But no question of recouping one-half of such damages to the cargo from the moiety of damages awarded the <em>Conemaugh</em> was made by counsel or passed upon by this Court.  It is now insisted that, under the cases of <em>The Chattahoochee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/173/540/case.html">173 U. S. 540</a></span>, and <em>The Albert Dumois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/177/240/case.html">177 U. S. 240</a></span>, this should have been done.  This may be so, but it is an entirely new question, quite unaffected by the case of the <em>New York,</em> and if the court erred in refusing to allow such recoupment, the remedy is by appeal, and not by mandamus.  Perhaps a mandamus might lie to review the allowance of interest, but that may also be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p>No disobedience of the mandate having been shown, the petition must be</p>\n<p><em>Denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
