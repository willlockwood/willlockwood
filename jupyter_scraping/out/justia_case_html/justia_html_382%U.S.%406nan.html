JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 1964, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment\'s privilege against compulsory self-incrimination "is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States."  <em>Malloy v. Hogan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html">378 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html#6">378 U.

California,</em> decided on April 28, 1965, the Court held that adverse comment by a prosecutor or trial judge upon a defendant\'s failure to testify in a state criminal trial violates the federal privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, because such comment "cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly."  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html">380 U. S. 609</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html#614">380 U. S. 614</a></span>.  The question before us now is whether the rule of <em>Griffin v. California</em> is to be given retrospective application.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the summer of 1961, the respondent was brought to trial before a jury in an Ohio court upon an indictment charging violations of the Ohio Securities Act. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The respondent did not testify in his own behalf, and the prosecuting attorney, in his summation to the jury, commented extensively upon that fact. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The jury found </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 382 U. S. 408</a></p><p> the respondent guilty, the judgment of conviction was affirmed by an Ohio court of appeals, and the Supreme Court of Ohio declined further review.  173 Ohio St. 542, 184 N.E.2d 213.  The respondent then brought his case to this Court, claiming several constitutional errors but not attacking the Ohio comment rule as such.  On May 13, 1963, we dismissed the appeal and denied certiorari, MR. JUSTICE BLACK dissenting.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/240/case.html">373 U. S. 240</a></span>.  All avenues of direct review of the respondent\'s conviction were thus fully foreclosed more than a year before our decision in <em>Malloy v. Hogan, supra,</em> and almost two years before our decision in <em>Griffin v. California, supra.</em></p>\n<p>A few weeks after our denial of certiorari, the respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, again alleging various constitutional violations in his state trial.  The District Court dismissed the petition, and the respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  On November 10, 1964, that court reversed, noting that,</p>\n<p>"the day before the oral argument of this appeal, the Supreme Court, in <em>Malloy v. Hogan</em> . . . , reconsidered its previous rulings and held that the Fifth Amendment\'s exception from self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the states,"</p>\n<p>and reasoning that</p>\n<p>"the protection against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment includes not only the right to refuse to answer incriminating questions, but also the right that such refusal shall not be commented upon by counsel for the prosecution."</p>\n<p>337 F.2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, requesting the parties "to brief and argue the question of the retroactivity of the doctrine announced in <em>Griffin v. California.</em> . . ."  381 U.S. 923.  Since, as we have noted, the original Ohio </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 382 U. S. 409</a></p><p> judgment of conviction in this case became final long before <em>Griffin v. California</em> was decided by this Court, that question is squarely presented. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span>, we held that the exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span>, was not to be given retroactive effect.  The <em>Linkletter</em> opinion reviewed in some detail the competing conceptual and jurisprudential theories bearing on the problem of whether a judicial decision that overturns previously established law is to be given retroactive, or only prospective, application.  MR. JUSTICE CLARK\'s opinion for the Court outlined the history and theory of the problem in terms both of the views of the commentators and of the decisions in this and other courts which have reflected those views.  It would be a needless exercise here to survey again a field so recently and thoroughly explored. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 382 U. S. 410</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Rather, we take as our starting point <em>Linkletter\'s</em> conclusion that "the accepted rule today is that, in appropriate cases, the Court may, in the interest of justice, make the rule prospective," that there is</p>\n<p>"no impediment -- constitutional or philosophical -- to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application,"</p>\n<p>in short, that "the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect."  Upon that premise, resolution of the issue requires us to</p>\n<p>"weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation."</p>\n<p>381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#628">381 U. S. 628</a></span>-629. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>Twining v. New Jersey</em> was decided in 1908.   <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/case.html">211 U. S. 211</a></span> U.S. 78.  In that case, the plaintiffs in error had been convicted by the New Jersey courts after a trial in which the judge had instructed the jury that it might draw an adverse inference from the defendants\' failure to testify.  The plaintiffs in error urged in this Court two propositions:</p>\n<p>"first, that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution against impairment by the States; and, second, if it be so guaranteed, that the exemption was, in fact, impaired in the case at bar."</p>\n<p>211 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/case.html#91">211 U. S. 91</a></span>.  In a lengthy opinion which thoroughly considered both the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court held, explicitly and unambiguously,</p>\n<p>"that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the States is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 382 U. S. 411</a></p><p> not secured by any part of the Federal Constitution."</p>\n<p>211 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/case.html#114">211 U. S. 114</a></span>.  Having thus rejected the first proposition advanced by the plaintiffs in error, the Court refrained from passing on the second.  That is, the Court did not decide whether adverse comment upon a defendant\'s failure to testify constitutes a violation of the federal constitutional right against self-incrimination. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The rule thus established in the <em>Twining</em> case was reaffirmed many times through the ensuing years.  In an opinion for the Court in 1934, Mr. Justice Cardozo cited <em>Twining</em> for the proposition that "[t]he privilege against self-incrimination may be withdrawn and the accused put upon the stand as a witness for the state."  <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/97/case.html">291 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/97/case.html#105">291 U. S. 105</a></span>.  Two years later Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous Court, reiterated the explicit statements of the rule in <em>Twining</em> and <em>Snyder,</em> noting that</p>\n<p>"[t]he compulsion to which the quoted statements refer is that of the processes of justice by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify."</p>\n<p><em>Brown v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html">297 U. S. 278</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html#285">297 U. S. 285</a></span>.  In 1937, the Court again approved the <em>Twining</em> doctrine in <em>Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html#324">302 U. S. 324</a></span>, 325-326.  In <em>Adamson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/case.html">332 U. S. 46</a></span>, the issue was once more presented to the Court in much the same form as it had been presented almost 40 years earlier in <em>Twining.</em>  In <em>Adamson,</em> there had been comment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="412">Page 382 U. S. 412</a></p><p> by Judge and prosecutor upon the defendant\'s failure to testify at his trial, as permitted by the California Constitution.  The Court again followed <em>Twining</em> in holding that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a State to accord the privilege against self-incrimination, and, as in <em>Twining,</em> the Court did not reach the question whether adverse comment upon a defendant\'s failure to testify would violate the Fifth Amendment privilege. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Thereafter, the Court continued to adhere to the <em>Twining</em> rule, notably in <em>Knapp v. Schweitzer,</em> decided in 1958, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/371/case.html">357 U. S. 371</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/371/case.html#374">357 U. S. 374</a></span>, and in <em>Cohen v. Hurley,</em> decided in 1961, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/117/case.html">366 U. S. 117</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/117/case.html#127">366 U. S. 127</a></span>-129.</p>\n<p>In recapitulation, this brief review clearly demonstrates:  (1) For more than half a century, beginning in 1908, the Court adhered to the position that the Federal Constitution does not require the States to accord the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  (2) Because of this position, the Court, during that period, never reached the question whether the federal guarantee against self-incrimination prohibits adverse comment upon a defendant\'s failure to testify at his trial. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Although there were strong dissenting voices, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the Court made not the slightest deviation from that position during a period of more than 50 years.</p>\n<p>Thus matters stood in 1964, when <em>Malloy v. Hogan</em> announced that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 382 U. S. 413</a></p><p> against abridgment by the States (378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html#6">378 U. S. 6</a></span>).  Less than a year later, on April 28, 1965, <em>Griffin v. California</em> held that the Fifth Amendment, "in its bearing on the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids . . . comment by the prosecution on the accused\'s silence. . . ."  (380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html#615">380 U. S. 615</a></span>.)</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Thus, we must reckon here, as in <em>Linkletter,</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#636">381 U. S. 636</a></span>, with decisional history of a kind which Chief Justice Hughes pointed out</p>\n<p>"is an operative fact, and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.  The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration."</p>\n<p><em>Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/371/case.html">308 U. S. 371</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/371/case.html#374">308 U. S. 374</a></span>.  It is against this background that we look to the purposes of the <em>Griffin</em> rule, the reliance placed upon the <em>Twining</em> doctrine, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Griffin.</em> <em>See Linkletter v. Walker,</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#636">381 U. S. 636</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Linkletter,</em> the Court stressed that the prime purpose of the rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] rejecting the doctrine of <em>Wolf v. Colorado</em> [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] as to the admissibility of unconstitutionally seized evidence, was "to deter the lawless action of the police and to effectively enforce the Fourth Amendment."  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#637">381 U. S. 637</a></span>.  There, we could not</p>\n<p>"say that this purpose would be advanced by making the rule retrospective.  The misconduct of the police prior to <em>Mapp</em> has already occurred, and will not be corrected by releasing the prisoners involved."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>No such single and distinct "purpose" can be attributed to <em>Griffin v. California,</em> holding it constitutionally impermissible for a State to permit comment by a judge or prosecutor upon a defendant\'s failure to testify in a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 382 U. S. 414</a></p><p> criminal trial.  The <em>Griffin</em> opinion reasoned that such comment "is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege.  It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly."  380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html#614">380 U. S. 614</a></span>.  It follows that the "purpose" of the <em>Griffin</em> rule is to be found in the whole complex of values that the privilege against self-incrimination itself represents, values described in the <em>Malloy</em> case as reflecting</p>\n<p>"recognition that the American system of criminal prosecution is accusatorial, not inquisitorial, and that the Fifth Amendment privilege is its essential mainstay. . . .  Governments, state and federal, are thus constitutionally compelled to establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured, and may not, by coercion, prove a charge against an accused out of his own mouth. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]"</p>\n<p>378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html#7">378 U. S. 7</a></span>-8. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 382 U. S. 415</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Insofar as these "purposes" of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination bear on the question before us in the present case, several considerations become immediately apparent.  First, the basic purposes that lie behind the privilege against self-incrimination do not relate to protecting the innocent from conviction, but rather to preserving the integrity of a judicial system in which even the guilty are not to be convicted unless the prosecution "shoulder the entire load."  Second, since long before <em>Twining v. New Jersey,</em> all the States have, by their own law, respected these basic purposes by extending the protection of the testimonial privilege against self-incrimination to every defendant tried in their criminal courts.  In <em>Twining,</em> the Court noted that</p>\n<p>"all the States of the Union have, from time to time, with varying form but uniform meaning, included the privilege in their constitutions, except the States of New Jersey and Iowa, and, in those States, it is held to be part of the existing law."</p>\n<p>211 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/case.html#92">211 U. S. 92</a></span>.  <em>See also</em> 8 Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7 2252 (McNaughton rev.1961).  It follows that such variations as may have existed among the States in the application of their respective guarantees against self-incrimination during the 57 years between <em>Twining</em> and <em>Griffin</em> did not go to the basic purposes of the federal privilege.  And, finally, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 382 U. S. 416</a></p><p> insofar as strict application of the federal privilege against self-incrimination reflects the Constitution\'s concern for the essential values represented by</p>\n<p>"our respect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each individual \'to a private enclave where he may lead a private life,\' [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]"</p>\n<p>any impingement upon those values resulting from a State\'s application of a variant from the federal standard cannot now be remedied.  As we pointed out in <em>Linkletter</em> with respect to the Fourth Amendment rights there in question, "the ruptured privacy . . . cannot be restored."  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#637">381 U. S. 637</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As in <em>Mapp,</em> therefore, we deal here with a doctrine which rests on considerations of quite a different order from those underlying other recent constitutional decisions which have been applied retroactively.  The basic purpose of a trial is the determination of truth, and it is self-evident that to deny a lawyer\'s help through the technical intricacies of a criminal trial or to deny a full opportunity to appeal a conviction because the accused is poor is to impede that purpose, and to infect a criminal proceeding with the clear danger of convicting the innocent.  <em>See Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span>; <em>Doughty v. Maxwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/202/case.html">376 U. S. 202</a></span>; <em>Griffin v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html">351 U. S. 12</a></span>; <em>Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/214/case.html">357 U. S. 214</a></span>.  The same can surely be said of the wrongful use of a coerced confession.  <em>See Jackson v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/368/case.html">378 U. S. 368</a></span>; <em>McNerlin v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/575/case.html">378 U. S. 575</a></span>; <em>Reck v. Pate,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/433/case.html">367 U. S. 433</a></span>.  By contrast, the Fifth Amendment\'s privilege against self-incrimination is not an adjunct to the ascertainment of truth.  That privilege, like the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, stands as a protection of quite different constitutional values -- values reflecting the concern of our society for the right of each individual to be let alone.  To recognize this is no more than to accord those values undiluted respect. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 382 U. S. 417</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There can be no doubt of the States\' reliance upon the <em>Twining</em> rule for more than half a century, nor can it be doubted that they relied upon that constitutional doctrine in the utmost good faith.  Two States amended their constitutions so as expressly to permit comment upon a defendant\'s failure to testify, Ohio in 1912, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and California in 1934. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  At least four other States followed some variant of the rule permitting comment. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, this reliance was not only invited over a much longer period of time, during which the <em>Twining</em> doctrine was repeatedly reaffirmed in this Court, but was of unquestioned legitimacy as compared to the reliance of the States upon the doctrine of <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> considered in <em>Linkletter</em> as an important factor militating against the retroactive application of <em>Mapp.</em>  During the 12-year period between <em>Wolf v. Colorado</em> and <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> the States were aware that illegal seizure of evidence by state officers violated the Federal Constitution. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  In the 56 years that elapsed from <em>Twining</em> to <em>Malloy,</em> by contrast, the States were repeatedly told that comment upon the failure of an accused to testify in a state criminal trial in no way violated the Federal Constitution. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 382 U. S. 418</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The last important factor considered by the Court in <em>Linkletter</em> was "the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Mapp.</em>"  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#636">381 U. S. 636</a></span>.  A retrospective application of <em>Griffin v. California</em> would create stresses upon the administration of justice more concentrated, but fully as great, as would have been created by a retrospective application of <em>Mapp.</em>  A retrospective application of <em>Mapp</em> would have had an impact only in those States which had not themselves adopted the exclusionary rule, apparently some 24 in number. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  A retrospective application of <em>Griffin</em> would have an impact only upon those States which have not themselves adopted the no-comment rule, apparently six in number. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  But, upon those six States, the impact would be very grave indeed.  It is not in every criminal trial that tangible evidence of a kind that might raise <em>Mapp</em> issues is offered.  But it may fairly be assumed that there has been comment in every single trial in the courts of California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio, in which the defendant did not take the witness stand -- in accordance with state law and with the United States Constitution as explicitly interpreted by this Court for 57 years.</p>\n<p>Empirical statistics are not available, but experience suggests that California is not indulging in hyperbole when, in its <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in this case, it tells us that,</p>\n<p>"Prior to this Court\'s decision in <em>Griffin,</em> literally thousands of cases were tried in California in which comment was made upon the failure of the accused to take the stand.  Those reaping the greatest benefit from a rule compelling retroactive application of <em>Griffin</em> would be [those] under lengthy sentences imposed many years before <em>Griffin.</em>  Their cases would offer the least like </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 382 U. S. 419</a></p><p> likelihood of a successful retrial, since, in many, if not most, instances, witnesses and evidence are no longer available."</p>\n<p>There is nothing to suggest that what would be true in California would not also be true in Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio.  To require all of those States now to void the conviction of every person who did not testify at his trial would have an impact upon the administration of their criminal law so devastating as to need no elaboration.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>We have proceeded upon the premise that "we are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively."  <em>Linkletter v.

We have considered the purposes of the <em>Griffin</em> rule, the reliance placed upon the <em>Twining</em> doctrine, and the effect upon the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Griffin.</em>  After full consideration of all the factors, we are not able to say that the <em>Griffin</em> rule requires retrospective application.</p>\n<p>The judgment is vacated, and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for consideration of the claims contained in the respondent\'s petition for habeas corpus, claims which that court has never considered.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
