That equitable relief might necessitate temporary suspension of a statute requiring prison officials to accept custody of prisoners does not men that a three-judge court was required to grant such relief, since the applicability of \xc2\xa7 2281 depends on whether a state statute is alleged to be unconstitutional, not on whether the remedy for unconstitutional state administrative behavior ultimately impinges on duties imposed under concededly constitutional state statutes.

A single District Judge found substantial constitutional violations and issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Division of Corrections either to reduce the inmate population or to increase prison capacity.  In an en banc decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the District Court\'s decision on the ground that only a three-judge court convened in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 could order such relief.  539 F.2d 547 (1976). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 430 U. S. 326</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On its face, the complaint that initiated this case involved no challenge to state statutes or regulations.  There was thus no reason at the beginning of this litigation to suspect that a three-judge court should hear the case.  <em>See Moody v. Flowers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/97/case.html">387 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/97/case.html#104">387 U.

Turman, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/322/case.html">430 U. S. 322</a></span>.  In granting equitable relief, however, the District Court contemplated as one means of relieving the prison system\'s unconstitutional overcrowding the possibility that state prison officials would have to violate their statutory duty to continue to accept custody of prisoners properly committed to them.  The Court of Appeals concluded that such equitable relief could be granted only by a three-judge court, apparently because it viewed the possible temporary suspension of an otherwise valid state statute to effectuate federally mandated relief as equivalent to finding that statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>We cannot agree.  The applicability of \xc2\xa7 2281 as written turns on whether a state statute is alleged to be unconstitutional, not on whether an equitable remedy for unconstitutional state administrative behavior ultimately impinges on duties imposed under concededly constitutional state statutes.  To hold otherwise would require postponing the threshold question of jurisdiction until the merits of the controversy had been fully resolved and the broad outlines of equitable relief discerned.  Section 2281 embodies no such wasteful and uncertain mandate.</p>\n<p>Since we conclude that the single District Judge properly exercised full jurisdiction in this case, and that his judgment is, therefore, reviewable on the merits in the Court of Appeals (28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291), the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> are granted, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
