CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL,</p>\n<p>The appraisement is not conclusive evidence of the value, but in this case it is the best evidence.  It was made by officers of the court under its order, and was regularly returned and filed.  It does not impeach the credibility of the witness now examined, for the value is a matter depending upon opinion, and with respect to which the judgments of men may honestly vary.  The appraised value would have been the matter in dispute if the property had been delivered up to the claimants upon security given.</p>\n<p>The appeals were all dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
