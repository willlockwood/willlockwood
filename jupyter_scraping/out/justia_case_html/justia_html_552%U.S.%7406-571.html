In holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca criminal who trades his firearm for drugs \xe2\x80\x98uses\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\xa6 within the meaning of \xc2\xa7924(c)(1),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U.

Later, in holding that merely possessing a firearm kept near the scene of drug trafficking is not \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(c)(1), the Court, in <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U.

Watson pleaded guilty but reserved the right to challenge the factual basis for a \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) conviction and sentence.

Neither <em>Smith, </em>which addressed only the trader who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up with the gun, nor <em>Bailey, </em>which ruled that a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A), decides this case.  With no statutory definition, the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d has to turn on \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday meaning\xe2\x80\x9d revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as \xe2\x80\x9cboth reasonable and normal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith, supra</em>, 228, 230.

Noting that \xc2\xa7924(d)(1) authorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms \xe2\x80\x9cintended to be used in\xe2\x80\x9d certain crimes, the Government infers that since some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm, \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transaction.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Smith</em> for the proposition that the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections overreads <em>Smith</em>.  The common verb \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d is not at odds in the two subsections but speaks to different issues in different voices and at different levels of specificity.  Section 924(d)(1) indicates that a gun can be \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d in a receipt crime, but does not say whether both parties to a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one; however, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) requires just such a specific identification.

It claims that failing to treat receipt in trade as \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d would create unacceptable asymmetry with <em>Smith; i.e., </em>it would be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other.  The problem is not with <em>Smith,</em> however, but with the limited malleability of the language it construed, and policy-driven symmetry cannot turn \xe2\x80\x9creceipt-in-trade\xe2\x80\x9d into \xe2\x80\x9cuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whatever the tension between the prior result and the outcome here, law depends on respect for language and would be served better by statutory amendment than by racking statutory language to cover a policy it fails to reach.

Watson, told a Government informant that he wanted to acquire a gun.  On the matter of price, the informant quoted no dollar figure but suggested that Watson could pay in narcotics.  Next, Watson met with the informant and an undercover law enforcement agent posing as a firearms dealer, to whom he gave 24 doses of oxycodone hydrocholoride (commonly, OxyContin) for a .50 caliber semiautomatic pistol.  When law enforcement officers arrested Watson, they found the pistol in his car, and a later search of his house turned up a cache of prescription medicines, guns, and ammunition.  Watson said he got the pistol \xe2\x80\x9cto protect his other firearms and drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A federal grand jury indicted him for distributing a Schedule II controlled substance and for \xe2\x80\x9cusing\xe2\x80\x9d the pistol during and in relation to that crime, in violation of \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Watson pleaded guilty across the board, reserving the right to challenge the factual basis for a \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) conviction and the added consecutive sentence of 60 months for using the gun.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 191 Fed. Appx. 326 (CA5 2006) <em>(per curiam)</em>, on Circuit precedent foreclosing any argument that Watson had not \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm, see <em>id.,</em> at 327 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ulloa</em>, 94 F.\xc2\xa03d 949 (CA5 1996) and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zuniga</em>, 18 F.\xc2\xa03d 1254 (CA5 1994)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether a person \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm within the meaning of 18 U.

To begin with, neither <em>Smith </em>nor<em> Bailey</em> implicitly decides this case.  While <em>Smith</em> held that firearms may be \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d in a barter transaction, even with no violent employment, see 508 U. S.<em>,</em> at 241, the case addressed only the trader who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up with the gun.  <em>Bailey</em>, too, is unhelpful, with its rule that a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A), as \xe2\x80\x9can operative factor in relation to the predicate offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 U. S., at 143.  The question here is whether it makes sense to say that Watson employed the gun at all; <em>Bailey</em> does not answer it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With no statutory definition or definitive clue, the meaning of the verb \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d has to turn on the language as we normally speak it, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 5); <em>Asgrow Seed Co.</em> v. <em>Winterboer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/179/index.html">513 U. S. 179</a>, 187 (1995); <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 476 (1994); there is no other source of a reasonable inference about what Congress understood when writing or what its words will bring to the mind of a careful reader.  So, in <em>Smith</em> we looked for \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d 508 U. S.<em>,</em> at 228, revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as \xe2\x80\x9cboth reasonable and normal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 230.  See also <em>Bailey, supra,</em> at 145.  This appeal to the ordinary leaves the Government without much of a case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government may say that a person \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm simply by receiving it in a barter transaction, but no one else would.  A boy who trades an apple to get a granola bar is sensibly said to use the apple, but one would never guess which way this commerce actually flowed from hearing that the boy used the granola.  Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stewart</em>, 246 F.\xc2\xa03d 728, 731 (CADC 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a person pays a cashier a dollar for a cup of coffee in the courthouse cafeteria, the customer has not used the coffee.  He has only used the dollar bill\xe2\x80\x9d).  So, when Watson handed over the drugs for the pistol, the informant or the agent[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d the pistol to get the drugs, just as <em>Smith </em>held, but regular speech would not say that Watson himself used the pistol in the trade.  \xe2\x80\x9cA seller does not \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 a buyer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Westmoreland</em>, 122 F.\xc2\xa03d 431, 436 (CA7 1997), and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary position recalls another case; <em>Lopez, supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 7), rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) because \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not normally speak or write the Government\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government would trump ordinary English with two arguments.  First, it relies on <em>Smith </em>for the pertinence of a neighboring provision, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(d)(1), which authorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms \xe2\x80\x9cintended to be used in\xe2\x80\x9d certain criminal offenses listed in \xc2\xa7924(d)(3).  Some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] from which the Government infers that \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(d) necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transaction.  <em>Smith</em> is cited for the proposition that the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections, and the Government urges us to import \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9creceipt in barter\xe2\x80\x9d into \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the Government that \xc2\xa7924(d) calls for attention; the reference to intended use in a receipt crime carries some suggestion that receipt can be \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d (more of a hint, say, than speaking of intended \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d in a crime defined as exchange).  But the suggestion is a tepid one and falls short of supporting what is really an attempt to draw a conclusion too specific from a premise too general.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Smith</em> majority rested principally on ordinary speech in reasoning that \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) extends beyond use as a weapon and includes use as an item of barter, see 508 U. S., at 228\xe2\x80\x93230, and the <em>Smith</em> opinion looks to \xc2\xa7924(d) only for its light on that conclusion.  It notes that the \xe2\x80\x9cintended to be used\xe2\x80\x9d clause of \xc2\xa7924(d)(1) refers to offenses where \xe2\x80\x9cthe firearm is <em>not </em>used as a weapon but instead as an item of barter or commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 234, with the implication that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d to reach commercial transactions, not just gun violence, in \xc2\xa7924(d) generally, see <em>id.,</em> at 234\xe2\x80\x93235.  It was this breadth of treatment that led the <em>Smith </em>majority to say that, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless we are to hold that using a firearm has a different meaning in \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) than it does in \xc2\xa7924(d)\xe2\x80\x94and clearly we should not\xe2\x80\x94we must reject petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s narrow interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 235 (citation omitted); see also <em>Bailey, supra,</em> at 146 (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]sing a firearm should not have a different meaning in \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) than it does in \xc2\xa7924(d)\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government overreads <em>Smith</em>.  While the neighboring provision indicates that a firearm is \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d nonoffensively, and supports the conclusion that a gun can be \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d in barter, beyond that point its illumination fails.  This is so because the utility of \xc2\xa7924(d)(1) is limited by its generality and its passive voice; it tells us a gun can be \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d in a receipt crime, but not whether both parties to a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one.  The nearby subsection (c)(1)(A), however, requires just such a specific identification.  It provides that a person who uses a gun in the circumstances described commits a crime, whose perpetrator must be clearly identifiable in advance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The agnosticism on the part of \xc2\xa7924(d)(1) about who does the using is entirely consistent with common speech\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that the first possessor is the one who \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d the gun in the trade, and there is thus no cause to  admonish us to adhere to the paradigm of a statute \xe2\x80\x9cas a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, \xe2\x80\xa6 in which the operative words have a consistent meaning throughout,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U. S. 561</a>, 569 (1995), or to invoke the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard principle of statutory construction \xe2\x80\xa6 that identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Powerex Corp.</em> v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7).  Subsections (d)(1) and (c)(1)(A) as we read them are not at odds over the verb \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d; the point is merely that in the two subsections the common verb speaks to different issues in different voices and at different levels of specificity.  The provisions do distinct jobs, but we do not make them guilty of employing the common verb inconsistently.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second effort to trump regular English is the claim that failing to treat receipt in trade as \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d would create unacceptable asymmetry with <em>Smith</em>.  At bottom, this atextual policy critique says it would be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other: \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he danger to society is created not only by the person who brings the firearm to the drug transaction, but also by the drug dealer who takes the weapon in exchange for his drugs during the transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 23.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The position assumes that <em>Smith </em>must be respected, and we join the Government at least on this starting point.  A difference of opinion within the Court (as in <em>Smith</em>) does not keep the door open for another try at statutory construction, where <em>stare decisis</em> has \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force [since] the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U.

What is more, in 14 years Congress has taken no step to modify <em>Smith</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, and this long congressional acquiescence \xe2\x80\x9chas enhanced even the usual precedential force\xe2\x80\x9d we accord to our interpretations of statutes, <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U.

It was amended after <em>Bailey</em> and now prohibits not only using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, but also possessing one \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of\xe2\x80\x9d such a crime.  18 U.
