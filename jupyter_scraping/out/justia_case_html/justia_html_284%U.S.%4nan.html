The question raised is whether the mortgage is void also as against those who gave the bankrupt credit at a later date, after the mortgage was on record.  The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed an order of the District Judge giving the mortgage priority over the last creditors.  45 F.2d 449.  Whether the court was right must be decided by the Bankruptcy Act, since it is superior to all state laws upon the subject.  <em>Globe Bank v.

Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, \xc2\xa7 70; U.S.Code, Title 11, \xc2\xa7 110.  By \xc2\xa7 67, Code, Title 11, \xc2\xa7 107(a), claims which, for want of record or for other reasons, would not have been valid liens as against the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt shall not be liens against his estate.  The rights of the trustee by subrogation are to be enforced for the benefit of the estate.  The Circuit Courts of Appeal seem generally to agree, as the language of the Bankruptcy Act appears to us to imply very plainly, that what thus is recovered for the benefit of the estate is to be distributed in "dividends of an equal percentum . . . on all allowed claims, except such as have priority or are secured."
