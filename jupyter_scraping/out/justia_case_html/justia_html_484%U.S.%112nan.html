Clearly, an act "on behalf of" the Board is not the same as an act "of the Board" itself.  Further, the Act\'s provisions, particularly \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3 and 10, evidence a congressional intent to distinguish unreviewable prosecutorial orders of the General Counsel from judicially reviewable orders of the Board.  The NLRA\'s history also confirms this distinction, demonstrating that the "on behalf of the Board" language was added to make it clear that the General Counsel acts within the agency, not to imply that the General Counsel\'s acts should be considered acts of the Board.

We hold that such a dismissal is not subject to judicial review under either the amended National Labor Relations Act or the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In August, 1984, respondent, the United Food Workers, filed unfair labor practice charges with the Pittsburgh regional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 484 U. S. 115</a></p><p> office of the National Labor Relations Board (Board).  The charges alleged that Charley Brothers, Inc., the owner of several grocery stores, and the United Steelworkers Union (Steelworkers), had committed an unfair labor practice by bargaining for and executing a collective bargaining agreement for a Charley Brothers store where the Steelworkers did not represent an uncoerced majority of the employees.  The Regional Director duly investigated the charges, and entered into settlement negotiations with Charley Brothers and the Steelworkers.  No agreement was reached, and the Regional Director filed a formal complaint substantially incorporating respondent\'s charges.</p>\n<p>On September 24, 1984, Vic\'s Market\'s, Inc. (Vic\'s), bought the relevant store, and the Regional Director filed a second complaint that reflected this fact.  A hearing on the complaints was scheduled for December 4, 1984.  However, shortly before the hearing was to begin, Vic\'s, Charley Brothers, the Steelworkers, and the Regional Director came to a tentative settlement agreement.  The agreement called for the charged parties to take certain remedial action in return for dismissal of the complaint, but they were not required to admit that they had committed any unfair labor practice. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Regional Director invited respondent to join </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 484 U. S. 116</a></p><p> the agreement, but respondent refused, citing a number of purported deficiencies. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Eventually, the settlement was entered into by all parties except respondent, who, as permitted by Board regulations, challenged the Regional Director\'s action before the General Counsel.  The General Counsel determined that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing, and sustained the settlement.  Respondent then sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p>The Board argued that the petition for review should be dismissed on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to review an informal settlement that did not result in an order of the Board, and that was entered into before hearings began.  Alternatively, the Board argued that the settlement should be sustained.  The Court of Appeals, considering itself bound by its own precedent, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] concluded that it had jurisdiction, and, on the merits, held that the complaint should not have been dismissed without an evidentiary hearing.  788 F.2d 178 (1986).  We granted the Board\'s petition for a writ </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 484 U. S. 117</a></p><p> of certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  479 U.S. 1029 (1987).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the courts of appeals have no jurisdiction under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to review settlement decisions of the General Counsel that do not result in Board orders and that are entered into before the commencement of hearings on the complaint.  Respondent asserts two grounds for jurisdiction.  The first is that all settlements occurring after a complaint is filed must be approved by the Board.  Because final orders of the Board are judicially reviewable under \xc2\xa7 10(f) of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 455, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f), respondent maintains that the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review settlements.  Alternatively, respondent argues that, because the General Counsel acts "on behalf of the Board," his or her decisions are subject to judicial review as if they were orders "of the Board."  Neither of respondent\'s submissions persuades us.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The NLRA, as originally enacted, granted the Board plenary authority over all aspects of unfair labor practice disputes:  the Board controlled not only the filing of complaints, but their prosecution and adjudication.  The Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 136, altered this structure.</p>\n<p>One of the major goals of the LMRA was to divide the old Board\'s prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 484 U. S. 118</a></p><p> two entities. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The House passed a bill that would have created a separate agency, known as the "office of Administrator of the National Labor Relations Act," to prosecute unfair labor practice complaints. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Under the House bill, the Board would have been retained to adjudicate the disputes.  The Conference Committee did not go so far as to create a new agency.  It did, though, determine that the General Counsel of the Board should be independent of the Board\'s supervision and review.  To this end, the General Counsel is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is the</p>\n<p>"final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints . . . and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]"</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153(d).</p>\n<p>The methods and procedures for the resolution of unfair labor practice charges are set out in statutes and in regulations promulgated by the Board pursuant to congressional authority.  \xc2\xa7 156.  A union, employer, or employee may bring an unfair labor practice charge to a regional office.  Until such a charge is brought, the Board may take no enforcement action.  <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/132/case.html">421 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/132/case.html#156">421 U. S. 156</a></span> (1975).  Once a charge is brought and investigated, the regional director may, in his discretion, dismiss it.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 484 U. S. 119</a></p><p> Should this occur, the charging party may appeal to the General Counsel, but not to the Board.  29 CFR \xc2\xa7 101.6 (1987). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Alternatively, the regional director may enter into an "informal settlement" agreement with the charged party.  Such an agreement provides that the charged party will take or refrain from taking certain action, in return for which the regional director agrees not to file a complaint.  If the charging party refuses to consent to this informal agreement, it may appeal to the General Counsel, but again, there is no provision for review by the Board.  \xc2\xa7 101.7. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>If the regional director concludes that the charges have merit, and if no informal settlement is reached, he may issue a complaint.  Once a complaint issues, it may be disposed of by withdrawal before hearing, settlement, or formal adjudication.</p>\n<p>The regional director is authorized to withdraw a complaint on his own motion at any time before the hearing.  Such a withdrawal may be appealed to the General Counsel, but no Board review is available. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 484 U. S. 120</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If the complaint is settled before the hearing, the disposition may take one of several forms.  "Formal settlement" requires Board approval, and is accompanied by the charged party\'s agreement to a remedial Board order, and usually consent to the entry of an enforcement order in the court of appeals.  \xc2\xa7 101.9(b)(1). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  "Informal settlement" is similar to the precomplaint settlement already discussed.  The only difference is that, rather than refraining from filing a complaint, the regional director dismisses the complaint without prejudice to reinstatement should the charged party not fulfill its part of the agreement.  \xc2\xa7 101.9(b)(2). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Because a Board order is part of all formal settlements, Board approval is required before such an agreement may be executed.  The applicable regulations expressly allow an opportunity for a nonconsenting party to appeal to the General Counsel, and from there to the Board.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101.9(c)(1) and (2). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Ultimately, judicial review of the Board order is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 484 U. S. 121</a></p><p> available.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f).  If the prehearing settlement is informal, an appeal is permitted to the General Counsel by a nonjoining party, but there is no provision for Board review.  29 CFR \xc2\xa7 101.9(c)(3) (1987). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Once the hearing on the complaint begins, the Board\'s regulations do not permit the General Counsel to enter into an unreviewable settlement agreement, even if it is "informal."  Rather, a nonconsenting party may challenge the settlement before the administrative law judge, and an appeal is available from the judge\'s determination to the Board. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Judicial review is authorized from the Board\'s decision.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 484 U. S. 122</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, the complaint may be disposed of by formal adjudication.  The procedures for such determinations are provided by statute.  Once a complaint issues, the charged party has the right to answer and the right to a hearing.  If the Board finds, based on a preponderance of the testimony, that the charged party engaged in an unfair labor practice, it is empowered to issue a cease-and-desist order and other appropriate relief.  Conversely, it must dismiss the complaint if it finds that no such practice occurred. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Any party, including the charging party, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] aggrieved by an order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain review of the Board\'s final order in the court of appeals.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The dispute in the case before us is a narrow one.  The parties agree that the General Counsel\'s approval of a determination not to file an unfair labor practice complaint is not subject to judicial review, whether or not it is the result of an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 484 U. S. 123</a></p><p> informal settlement.  <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/132/case.html#148">421 U.

The parties also agree that any settlement that ultimately results in Board approval is subject to judicial review, even if the settlement is informal but entered into after the hearing commenced.  The sole dispute is whether a postcomplaint, prehearing informal settlement is subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>We first address respondent\'s argument that the regulations just described, which permit the General Counsel to determine the validity of a postcomplaint informal settlement, but do not provide for an appeal to the Board, are inconsistent with the NLRA.  Essentially, this is an argument that respondent was entitled to a Board order subject to judicial review under 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f). [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>We review the validity of the relevant regulations, promulgated pursuant to congressional authority, under the standards prescribed in <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html">480 U. S. 421</a></span> (1987).  On a pure question of statutory construction, our first job is to try to determine congressional intent, using "traditional tools of statutory construction."  If we can do so, then that interpretation must be given effect, and the regulations at issue must be fully consistent with it.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#446">480 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</l=437></p>\n<p>The words, structure, and history of the LMRA amendments to the NLRA clearly reveal that Congress intended to differentiate between the General Counsel\'s and the Board\'s "final authority" along a prosecutorial versus adjudicatory line.  Section 3(d) of the NLRA provides that the General Counsel has "final authority" regarding the filing, investigation, and "prosecution" of unfair labor practice complaints.  Conversely, when the authority of the Board is discussed (with regard to unfair labor practice complaints), it is in the context of the <em>adjudication</em> of complaints.  Specifically, \xc2\xa7 10 of the Act refers to the Board and the procedures it must follow to decide unfair labor practice cases.</p>\n<p>The history of the LMRA also reflects this dichotomy.  The House Conference Report on the LMRA states:</p>\n<p>"The conference agreement does not make provision for an independent agency to exercise the investigating and prosecuting functions under the act, but does provide that there shall be a General Counsel of the Board . . . [who] is to have the final authority to act in the name of, but independently of any direction, control, or review by, the Board in respect of the investigation of charges and the issuance of complaints of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 484 U. S. 125</a></p><p> unfair labor practices, <em>and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board.</em>"</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 37 (1947) (emphasis added).  Similarly, a summary submitted to the Senate detailing the Conference Committee compromise reads:</p>\n<p>"Further, [the LMRA] <em>recognizes the principle of separating judicial and prosecuting functions</em> without going to the extent of establishing a completely independent agency.  It accomplishes separation of functions within the framework of the existing agency by establishing a new statutory office, that is, a general counsel of the Board. . . ."</p>\n<p>93 Cong.Rec. 6442 (1947) (emphasis added).  The legislative debates further support this division.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 3423-3424 (1947) (remarks of Rep. Hartley); <em>id.</em> at 6383 (remarks of Rep. Owens).  Finally, the contemporaneous agency interpretation of the LMRA emphasized the prosecutorial/adjudicatory dichotomy.  <em>See</em> 13 Fed.Reg. 654 (1948).</p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing, the general congressional framework, dividing the final authority of the General Counsel and the Board along a prosecutorial and adjudicatory line, is easy to discern.  Some agency decisions can be said with certainty to fall on one side or the other of this line.  For example, as already discussed, decisions whether to file a complaint are prosecutorial.  In contrast, the resolution of contested unfair labor practice cases is adjudicatory.  But between these extremes are cases that might fairly be said to fall on either side of the division.  Our task, under <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em> and <em>Chevron,</em> is not judicially to categorize each agency determination, but rather to decide whether the agency\'s regulatory placement is permissible.</p>\n<p>Respondent would have us hold that, after a complaint is filed, all dispositions can <em>only</em> be deemed adjudicatory.  It is true that the filing of a complaint is the necessary first step to trigger the Board\'s adjudicatory authority.  However, until a hearing is held, the Board has taken no action; no <em>adjudication</em> has yet taken place.  We hold that it is a reasonable construction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 484 U. S. 126</a></p><p> of the NLRA to find that, until the hearing begins, settlement or dismissal determinations are prosecutorial. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, we fail to see why the General Counsel should have the concededly unreviewable discretion to file a complaint, but not the same discretion to withdraw the complaint before hearing if further investigation discloses that the case is too weak to prosecute.  <em>See International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Lubbers,</em> 681 F.2d 598, 604 (CA9 1982), <em>cert. denied,</em> 459 U.S. 1201 (1983); <em>George Banta Co. v.

NLRB,</em> 339 F.2d 795, 799 (CA2 1964); <em>cf. Cuyahoga Valley R. Co. v. Transportation Union,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/3/case.html">474 U. S. 3</a></span> (1985) (the Secretary of Labor\'s decision to dismiss an Occupational Safety and Health Act complaint is not subject to review by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission).  The General Counsel\'s unreviewable discretion to file and withdraw a complaint, in turn, logically supports a reading that he or she must also have final authority to dismiss a complaint in favor of an informal settlement, at least before a hearing begins.</p>\n<p>But respondent contends that the LMRA\'s legislative history makes clear Congress\' understanding that the Board would review all dismissals once a complaint is filed.  Our examination of the legislative history discloses no such support for respondent\'s argument.  Indeed, we find that the legislative history supports petitioners\' position.</p>\n<p>Respondent asserts that, at the time the LMRA was passed in 1947, the practice of the Board was to delegate to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 484 U. S. 127</a></p><p> an "anonymous committee" the resolution of appeals from determinations by regional directors not to file complaints.  Respondent further argues that, once a complaint was filed, any final disposition was subject to Board approval.  The conclusion respondent would have us draw from this is that Congress intended only to replace the "anonymous committee" with the General Counsel, and that the authority that the Board had retained prior to 1947 survived, and was carried forward in the LMRA amendments to the NLRA. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>This inference is too strained to withstand scrutiny.  It is clear, of course, that Congress intended to place final authority regarding the filing of complaints in the General Counsel.  But it is equally clear that Congress intended the scope of the General Counsel\'s authority to be far broader than respondent suggests.  Congress intended that the General Counsel should not only resolve appeals regarding the filing of complaints, but that he or she should be the "final authority" concerning the "prosecution" of complaints as well, a function not performed by the "anonymous committee" prior to 1947.  We repeat that Congress intended to create an officer independent of the Board to handle <em>prosecutions,</em> not merely the filing of complaints.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the silence of the legislative history regarding settlements does not suggest that Congress was carrying forward the prior settlement structure.  For Congress was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 484 U. S. 128</a></p><p> aware that settlements constitute the "lifeblood" of the administrative process, especially in labor relations. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Given their importance, we cannot attribute to Congress an intention to deny the Board the usual flexibility accorded an agency in interpreting its authorizing statute and in developing new regulations to meet changing needs. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, the Board\'s regulations are consistent with amended NLRA.  Respondent was not entitled to Board review of the settlement.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Alternatively, respondent argues that, because the General Counsel acts "on behalf of the Board," his or her final determinations are reviewable under the NLRA as orders "of the Board."  We find this argument, too, unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>The plain language cited by respondent reflects that the General Counsel acts "<em>on behalf of</em>" the Board.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153(d). [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Clearly this is not the same as an act "of the Board" itself.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Further, the structure of the Act, far from supporting respondent, leads inescapably to the conclusion that Congress distinguished orders of the General Counsel from Board orders.  The statute describing the organization of the agency, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 484 U. S. 129</a></p><p> in which the "on behalf of the Board" language appears, differentiates between the two independent branches.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153.  The structure of \xc2\xa7 10 of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160) emphasizes the distinction. Section 10 specifies the procedure for <em>adjudicating</em> unfair labor practice charges.  Subsection 10(f) provides that final decisions "of the Board" shall be judicially reviewable, and, in the context of the entire section, discloses Congress\' decision to authorize review of <em>adjudications,</em> not of <em>prosecutions.</em>  Fairly read, this may encompass any Board adjudication resolving an unfair labor practice complaint, whether by final order, consent decree, or settlement.  But it plainly cannot be read to provide for judicial review of the General Counsel\'s prosecutorial function.</p>\n<p>The history of the Act confirms the distinction between orders of the General Counsel and Board orders.  In the House bill, the General Counsel was styled the "Administrator of the National Labor Relations Act," and headed a separate agency.  The Conference Committee decided to place the General Counsel within the agency, but to make the office independent of the Board\'s authority.  The Committee added the language "on behalf of the Board" to make it clear that the General Counsel acted within the agency, not to imply that the acts of the General Counsel would be considered acts of the Board. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 484 U. S. 130</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, since respondent concedes that the General Counsel\'s decision not to file a complaint is not reviewable under \xc2\xa7 10(f), we perceive no merit or logic in the argument that a settlement decision of the General Counsel may be.</p>\n<p>Again, the language, structure, and history of the NLRA, as amended, clearly differentiate between "prosecutorial" determinations, to be made solely by the General Counsel and which are not subject to review under the Act, and "adjudicatory" decisions, to be made by the Board and which are subject to judicial review.  As the decision in this case was "prosecutorial," it cannot be judicially reviewed under the NLRA.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent argues that, if the NLRA provides no judicial review of "prosecutorial" determinations, they may be reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as final agency actions "for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court."  5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 704.  It is true that the General Counsel\'s decision was a "final" action, and that there is no other adequate remedy in a court.  But review under the APA is unavailable of actions specified in 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701(a), that is, (1) where "statutes preclude judicial review"; or (2) where "agency action is committed to agency discretion by law."  Subsection (1) applies in this case. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 484 U. S. 131</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The statutory preclusion of judicial review must be demonstrated clearly and convincingly.  <em>Southern R. Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/444/case.html">442 U. S. 444</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/444/case.html#462">442 U. S. 462</a></span> (1979); <em>Dunlop v.

In the absence here of statutory language expressly precluding APA review, the Court must examine the structure and history of the statute to determine whether the requisite congressional intent to bar judicial review is clearly established.</p>\n<p>The NLRA leaves no doubt that it is meant to be, and is, a comprehensive statute concerning the disposition and review of the merits of unfair labor practice charges.  In particular, \xc2\xa7 10 exhaustively sets out the stages through which such charges may pass, from the filing of a complaint, to a Board determination, and to judicial enforcement and review.  Moreover, in the entire NLRA, judicial review is expressly provided only in respect of Board orders.  We have already determined, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/112/case.html#130">484 U. S. 130</a></span>, that Congress purposely excluded prosecutorial decisions from this review.  We proceed to demonstrate why it would be illogical in the extreme to hold that Congress did so only to permit review under the APA. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>To allow judicial review through the APA of the General Counsel\'s settlement determinations would run directly counter to the structure of the NLRA.  Appeals from final orders or dispositions of the Board are expressly directed to the courts of appeals.  Respondent nevertheless urges that the statute should be read to allow an APA suit, brought in the district court, to review final agency orders that are not adjudications.  Such review would involve lengthy judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 484 U. S. 132</a></p><p> proceedings in precisely the area where Congress was convinced that speed of resolution is most necessary.  This case provides a good illustration of what Congress set out to avoid.  Charges were filed by respondent in August, 1984.  By January, 1985, the settlement had been reached and all administrative review was exhausted.  However, the court proceedings took almost 15 months. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>This sort of delay, unavoidable in the judicial setting, is untenable in the settlement context, for, until the court ruled, the parties could not know whether their settlement agreement was valid.  In future cases, a charged party would have an incentive not to carry out its part of the bargain while judicial review is pending for fear that the settlement might be invalidated.  Obviously, the willingness of charged parties to resolve unfair labor practice charges quickly and expeditiously by way of an informal settlement after a complaint is filed would be severely constrained if APA review were allowed.</p>\n<p>The resulting consequences for the agency and the enforcement of the Act could be most serious.  In 1983, almost one-third of all unfair labor practice charges brought (excluding those terminated through voluntary withdrawal by the charging party or outright dismissal of the charges) were disposed of by way of an informal settlement reached after a complaint was filed, but before a hearing began. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  This hazard to the functioning of the "lifeblood" of the administrative process could certainly not have been the congressional intention.</p>\n<p>Finally, APA review of these settlements would inevitably require the federal courts, in the first adjudicatory instance, to examine the merits of unfair labor practice charges.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 484 U. S. 133</a></p><p> However, Congress has made plain its unequivocal desire that, absent statutory direction to the contrary, such examinations be made first by the Board, or not at all.  At least in the context of this statute, we are left with no doubt that Congress intended the right of judicial review on the merits of an unfair labor practice charge to be had only through the express provisions of the NLRA.</p>\n<p>Given the comprehensive nature of the NLRA with regard to unfair labor practice charges, and the absurd results of allowing an APA action to be brought where there is no judicial review provided in the Act, we conclude that the exception defined in 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701(a)(1) bars review here. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We conclude that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain this action under either the NLRA or the APA.  Consequently, we need not determine whether an evidentiary hearing should have been ordered.  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to dismiss the cause for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The agreement provided that Vic\'s and Charley Brothers (1) would not assist the Steelworkers\' organizing efforts or interrogate employees as to their union sympathies; (2) would not recognize the Steelworkers or give effect to the collective bargaining agreement unless the Steelworkers became the certified employee representative; (3) would not restrain or coerce the employees; and (4) would reimburse the employees for any dues already paid to the Steelworkers.  The agreement also stated that the Steelworkers (1) would not accept assistance from Vic\'s or Charley Brothers; (2) would not give effect to the collective bargaining agreement unless they became the certified employee representative; (3) would not restrain or coerce the employees in any way; and (4) would mail a notice of the agreement to all employees.  It was further agreed that a notice would be posted for 60 days at the store outlining the provisions of the settlement agreement.  However, the agreement did not require an admission by any party that an unfair labor practice had actually occurred, nor did it provide for a formal Board order or consent decree.  Finally, the Regional Director agreed to dismiss the complaint without prejudice to reinstatement should any of the charged parties not comply with the agreement.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>First, respondent argued that it did not have an adequate opportunity to reach a settlement through amicable adjustment.  Second, respondent contended that the 60-day posting period was too short to undo the damage already done by the improper representation; in other words, respondent maintained that a fair election could not be held with so brief a posting period.  Third, respondent requested special access to the store premises to enable it to compete in its organization efforts with the Steelworkers, who allegedly already had access to the store.  Fourth, respondent objected to the lack of a provision for either a formal Board order or consent decree, or an admission that an unfair labor practice had occurred.

Is that correct?"</p>\n<p>"Mr. HARTLEY.  The gentleman\'s opinion is absolutely correct.  The reference to the Board was necessary <em>because, in order to have this man independent of the Board, we had to use the term \'Board.\'</em>  Otherwise we would have had to set up a completely independent agency. . . .  <em>He acts on behalf of the Board, but completely independent of the Board.</em>"</p>\n<p>"Mr. MAcKINNON.

For example, opponents of the LMRA amendment to the NLRA creating an independent General Counsel cited to the APA as providing the best division between prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions within an agency.  93 Cong.Rec. 6455 (1947) (remarks of Sen.

If the dicta of <em>Cardoza-Fonseca,</em> as opposed to its expressed adherence to <em>Chevron,</em> were to be applied here, surely the question whether dismissal of complaints requires Board approval, and thus qualifies for judicial review under 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(f), would be "a pure question of statutory construction," rather than the application of a "standar[d] to a particular set of facts," as to which "the courts must respect the interpretation of the agency," 480 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#446">480 U.

Were we to follow those dicta, therefore, we would be deciding this issue conclusively and authoritatively, rather than merely "decid[ing] whether the agency\'s regulatory placement is permissible," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/112/case.html#125">484 U.

The same would be true, moreover, of the many other decisions alluded to by the Court in which "we have traditionally accorded the Board deference with regard to its interpretation of the NLRA," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/112/case.html#123">484 U. S. 123</a></span>.  Those cases, and this, are decided correctly only because "the statute is silent or ambiguous" with respect to an issue relevant to the agency\'s administration of the law committed to its charge -- which is the test for deference set forth in <em>Chevron.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
