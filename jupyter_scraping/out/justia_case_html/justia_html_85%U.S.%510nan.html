Accordingly, where certain military officers of the United States, being sued for the arrest and imprisonment of a person in Vermont not connected with the military service of the United States, alleged in their pleas that the arrest and imprisonment were made under the authority and by the order of the President, whose orders as commander in chief of the armies of the United States, by the rules and regulations of the army, they were bound to obey, without setting forth any order, general or special, of the President directing or approving of the acts in question, it was held that the pleas were defective and insufficient.</p>\n<p>2.

One of them averred that the plaintiff ought not to have and maintain his action by reason of the matters stated; the other averred that the cause by reason of these matters ought to be dismissed.  The difference was of no consequence upon the questions presented for the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p>Both pleas set up that at the time of the commission of the alleged grievances and long previously, a rebellion existed against the laws and government of the United States, and that the public safety was greatly imperiled; that it became necessary to raise troops to suppress the rebellion and insure the public safety, and for that purpose troops were raised in the Northern states, and especially in the military district embracing the Second Congressional District of Vermont; that the defendant Henry was at the time a military officer of the United States, namely, a provost marshal within and for that district, and the defendant Beckwith was an assistant provost marshal within the same district; that in November, 1864, at Newbury, in the County of Orange, in the state of Vermont, the plaintiff was charged with having been guilty of disloyal practices in aid of the rebellion, and of affording aid and comfort to the rebels, to-wit, with enticing soldiers, in June previous, to desert from the army of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 85 U.

S. 514</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FIELD, having stated the case, delivered the opinion of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p>There is no averment in the pleas that at the time the plaintiff was arrested any rebellion existed in the State of Vermont against the laws or government of the United States, or that any military operations were being carried on within its limits, or that the courts of justice were not open there, and in the full and undisturbed exercise of their regular jurisdiction, or that the plaintiff was in the military service of the United States or in any way connected with that service.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any averment in the pleas as to the manner in which, or the parties by whom the charges of disloyal practices were made.  It is not alleged that they were stated in writing or supported by oath. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 85 U. S. 515</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nor do the pleas, whilst asserting that the acts, which are the subject of complaint, were done under the authority and by the order of the President, set forth any order, general or special, of the President directing or approving of the acts in question.</p>\n<p>For this last omission, all the judges are agreed, without expressing any opinion upon the other omissions, that the pleas are defective and insufficient.  It is an old rule of pleading, which, in the modern progress of simplifying pleadings, has not lost its virtue, that whenever one justifies in a special plea an act which in itself constitutes at common law a wrong, upon the process, order, or authority of another, he must set forth substantially and in a traversable form the process, order, or authority relied upon, and that no mere averment of its legal effect, without other statement, will answer.  In other words, if a defendant has cause of justification for an alleged trespass, and undertakes to plead it, he must set it forth in its essential particulars so that the plaintiff may be apprised of its nature and take issue upon it if he desires and so that the court may be able to judge of its sufficiency.</p>\n<p>The defendants intended by their pleas to rest the justification of their conduct upon the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1863, entitled "An act relating to Habeas Corpus, and regulating judicial proceedings in certain cases," [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and of the Act of March 2, 1867, entitled</p>\n<p>"An act to declare valid and conclusive certain proclamations of the President, and acts done in pursuance thereof, or of his orders, in the suppression of the late rebellion against the United States. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>These statutes were enacted, among other things, to protect parties from liability to prosecution for acts done in the arrest and imprisonment of persons during the existence of the rebellion, under orders or proclamations of the President or by his authority or approval, who were charged with participation in the rebellion, or as aiders or abettors, or as being guilty of disloyal practices in aid thereof, or any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 85 U. S. 516</a></p><p> violation of the usages or the laws of war.  Assuming for this case that these statutes are not liable to any constitutional objection, they do not change the rules of pleading, when the defense is set up in a special plea, or dispense with the exhibition of the order or authority upon which a party relies.  Nor do they cover all acts done by officers in the military service of the United States simply because they are acting under the general authority of the President as commander in chief of the armies of the United States.  They only cover acts done under orders or proclamations issued by him or under his authority, and there is no difficulty in the defendants\' setting forth such orders or proclamations, whether general or special, if any were made, which applied to their case.</p>\n<p>The views thus expressed render it unnecessary to consider any other objections taken by the plaintiff to the pleas before us.</p>\n<p><em>The questions certified must be answered in the negative and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>12 Stat. at Large 756.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>14 <em>id.</em> 432.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>12 Stat. at Large 756, \xc2\xa7 4.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>14 <em>id.</em> 432.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
