S. 872</a>, where, in upholding a generally applicable law that burdened the sacramental use of peyote, this Court held that the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Free Exercise Clause does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws, <em>id.,</em> at 883\xe2\x80\x93890.  Among other things, RFRA prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(c), Schedule I(c).  After U. S. Customs inspectors seized a <em>hoasca</em> shipment to the American UDV and threatened prosecution, the UDV filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental <em>hoasca</em> use violates RFRA.  At a hearing on the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary injunction motion, the Government conceded that the challenged application would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion, but argued that this burden did not violate RFRA because applying the Controlled Substances Act was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting UDV members\xe2\x80\x99 health and safety, preventing the diversion of <em>hoasca</em> from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  The District Court granted relief, concluding that, because the parties\xe2\x80\x99 evidence on health risks and diversion was equally balanced, the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden on the UDV.  The court also held that the 1971 Convention does not apply to <em>hoasca</em>.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use of <em>hoasca</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that evidentiary equipoise as to potential harm and diversion is an insufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.  Given that the Government conceded the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie RFRA case in the District Court and that the evidence found to be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which the Government bore the burden of proof, the UDV effectively demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction hearing is foreclosed by <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/656/index.html">542 U. S. 656</a>, 666.  There, in affirming the grant of a preliminary injunction against the Government, this Court reasoned that the burdens with respect to the compelling interest test at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to limit the <em>Ashcroft</em> rule to content-based restrictions on speech is unavailing.  The fact that <em>Ashcroft </em>involved such a restriction in no way affected the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the consequences of having the burden at trial for preliminary injunction purposes.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same way as the test\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally mandated applications, including at the preliminary injunction stage.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Also rejected is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s central submission that, because it has a compelling interest in the <em>uniform</em> application of the Controlled Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made to accommodate the UDV.  The Government argues, <em>inter alia,</em> that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s description of Schedule I substances as having \xe2\x80\x9ca high potential for abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cno currently accepted medical use,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of accepted safety for use \xe2\x80\xa6 under medical supervision,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions, and that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory system, which prohibits all use of controlled substances except as the Act itself authorizes, see <em>Gonzales </em>v.<em> Raich, </em>545 U. S. ___, ___, cannot function properly if subjected to judicial exemptions.

RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \xe2\x80\x9cto the person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b).  Section 2000bb(b)(1) expressly adopted the compelling interest test of <em>Sherbert</em> v. <em>Verner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/index.html">374 U. S. 398</a>, and <em>Wisconsin</em> v. <em>Yoder,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/205/index.html">406 U. S. 205</a>.  There, the Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates, scrutinized the asserted harms, and granted specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.  <em>Id.,</em> at 213, 221, 236; <em>Sherbert, supra,</em> at 410.  Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters\xe2\x80\x9d in applying the compelling interest test, <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 327, and has emphasized that strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental purpose is to take  \xe2\x80\x9crelevant differences\xe2\x80\x9d into account, <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 228.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s more focused inquiry, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances cannot carry the day.  Although Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Touby</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/160/index.html">500 U. S. 160</a>, 162, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue.  That question <em>was</em> litigated below.  Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harm, the court noted that it could not ignore the congressional classification and findings.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its RFRA burden.  The Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cwaive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7822(d), reinforces that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.  Indeed, despite the fact that everything the Government says about the DMT in <em>hoasca </em>applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Executive and Congress have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote, see 21 CFR \xc2\xa71307.31; 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71996a(b)(1).  If such use is permitted in the face of the general congressional findings for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, those same findings alone cannot preclude consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.  See <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hialeah,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/520/index.html">508 U. S. 520</a>, 547.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the existence of a <em>congressional</em> exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to <em>judicially crafted</em> exceptions fails because RFRA plainly contemplates court-recognized exceptions, see \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(c).  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.  The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x99s outset, and there is no evidence that it has undercut the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on pre-<em>Smith </em>cases asserting a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause is unavailing.  Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise, but instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  See, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Lee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/index.html">455 U. S. 252</a>, 258, 260.  They show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.  Here the Government\xe2\x80\x99s uniformity argument rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery slope concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cif I make an exception for you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to \xe2\x80\x9crule[s] of general applicability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the legislated test is \xe2\x80\x9cworkable \xe2\x80\xa6 for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7200bb(a)(5), finds support in <em>Sherbert, supra,</em> at 407, and <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U. S. ___, ___.  While there may be instances where a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA, it would be surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding peyote exemption and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance.  The Government has not shown that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lee</em>.  It cannot now compensate for its failure to convince the District Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The Government argues unpersuasively that it has a compelling interest in complying with the 1971 U. N. Convention.  While this Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention does not cover <em>hoasca, </em>that does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use.  At this stage, it suffices that the Government did not submit any evidence addressing the international consequences of granting the UDV an exemption, but simply relied on two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general (and undoubted) importance of honoring international obligations and maintaining the United States\xe2\x80\x99 leadership in the international war on drugs.  Under RFRA, invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.

The Government concedes that this practice is a sincere exercise of religion, but nonetheless sought to prohibit the small American branch of the sect from engaging in the practice, on the ground that the Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the hallucinogen.  The sect sued to block enforcement against it of the ban on the sacramental tea, and moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion, unless the Government \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrates that application of the burden to the person\xe2\x80\x9d represents the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest.  42 U.

We granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  Before this Court, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s central submission is that it has a compelling interest in the <em>uniform</em> application of the Controlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the hallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect\xe2\x80\x99s sincere religious practice.  We conclude that the Government has not carried the burden expressly placed on it by Congress in the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, and affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U.

The Act classifies substances into five schedules based on their potential for abuse, the extent to which they have an accepted medical use, and their safety.  See \xc2\xa7812(b) (2000 ed.).  Substances listed in Schedule I of the Act are subject to the most comprehensive restrictions, including an outright ban on all importation and use, except pursuant to strictly regulated research projects.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823, 960(a)(1).  The Act authorizes the imposition of a criminal sentence for simple possession of Schedule I substances, see \xc2\xa7844(a), and mandates the imposition of a criminal sentence for possession \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense\xe2\x80\x9d such substances, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a), (b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0O Centro Esp\xc3\xadrita Beneficente Uni\xc4\x83o do Vegetal (UDV) is a Christian Spiritist sect based in Brazil, with an American branch of approximately 130 individuals.  Central to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s faith is receiving communion through <em>hoasca</em> (pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cwass-ca\xe2\x80\x9d), a sacramental tea made from two plants unique to the Amazon region.  One of the plants, <em>psychotria viridis</em>, contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogen whose effects are enhanced by alkaloids from the other plant, <em>banisteriopsis caapi</em>.  DMT, as well as \xe2\x80\x9cany material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of [DMT],\xe2\x80\x9d is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.  \xc2\xa7812(c), Schedule I(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, United States Customs inspectors intercepted a shipment to the American UDV containing three drums of <em>hoasca</em>.  A subsequent investigation revealed that the UDV had received 14 prior shipments of <em>hoasca</em>.  The inspectors seized the intercepted shipment and threatened the UDV with prosecution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The UDV filed suit against the Attorney General and other federal law enforcement officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use of <em>hoasca</em> violates RFRA.  Prior to trial, the UDV moved for a preliminary injunction, so that it could continue to practice its faith pending trial on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the Government conceded that the challenged application of the Controlled Substances Act would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion by the UDV.  See <em>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1236, 1252 (NM 2002).  The Government argued, however, that this burden did not violate RFRA, because applying the Controlled Substances Act in this case was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting the health and safety of UDV members, preventing the diversion of <em>hoasca</em> from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, a treaty signed by the United States and implemented by the Act.  Feb. 21, 1971, [1979\xe2\x80\x931980], 32 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 543, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 9725.  See 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1252\xe2\x80\x931253.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court heard evidence from both parties on the health risks of <em>hoasca</em> and the potential for diversion from the church.  The Government presented evidence to the effect that use of <em>hoasca</em>, or DMT more generally, can cause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and adverse drug interactions.  The UDV countered by citing studies documenting the safety of its sacramental use of <em>hoasca</em> and presenting evidence that minimized the likelihood of the health risks raised by the Government.  With respect to diversion, the Government pointed to a general rise in the illicit use of hallucinogens, and cited interest in the illegal use of DMT and <em>hoasca </em>in particular; the UDV emphasized the thinness of any market for <em>hoasca</em>, the relatively small amounts of the substance imported by the church, and the absence of any diversion problem in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court concluded that the evidence on health risks was \xe2\x80\x9cin equipoise,\xe2\x80\x9d and similarly that the evidence on diversion was \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually balanced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1262, 1266.  In the face of such an even showing, the court reasoned that the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying what it acknowledged was a substantial burden on the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sincere religious exercise.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1255.  The court also rejected the asserted interest in complying with the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, holding that the Convention does not apply to <em>hoasca</em>.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1266\xe2\x80\x931269.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s importation and use of <em>hoasca</em>.  The injunction requires the church to import the tea pursuant to federal permits, to restrict control over the tea to persons of church authority, and to warn particularly susceptible UDV members of the dangers of <em>hoasca</em>.  See Preliminary Injunction \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb62, 5\xe2\x80\x9312, 32\xe2\x80\x9333, App. F to App. to Pet. for Cert. 249a, 250a\xe2\x80\x93252a, 258a\xe2\x80\x93259a.  The injunction also provides that \xe2\x80\x9cif [the Government] believe[s] that evidence exists that <em>hoasca</em> has negatively affected the health of UDV members,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthat a shipment of <em>hoasca </em>contain[s] particularly dangerous levels of DMT, [the Government] may apply to the Court for an expedited determination of whether the evidence warrants suspension or revocation of [the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s authority to use <em>hoasca</em>].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 257a, \xc2\xb629.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government appealed the preliminary injunction and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, <em>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>342 F.\xc2\xa03d 1170 (2003), as did a majority of the Circuit sitting en banc, 389 F.\xc2\xa03d 973 (2004).  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/973/index.html">544 U.

Instead, the Government maintains that such evidentiary equipoise is an insufficient basis for issuing a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.  We review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s legal rulings <em>de novo</em> and its ultimate decision to issue the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.  See <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, 545 U. S. ___ , ___ (2005) (slip op., at 19).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government begins by invoking the well-established principle that the party seeking pretrial relief bears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mazurek</em> v. <em>Armstrong,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/968/index.html">520 U. S. 968</a>, 972 (1997) <em>(per curiam); Doran</em> v. <em>Salem Inn, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/922/index.html">422 U. S. 922</a>, 931 (1975).  The Government argues that the District Court lost sight of this principle in issuing the injunction based on a mere tie in the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A majority of the en banc Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and so do we.  Before the District Court, the Government conceded the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case under RFRA.  See 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1252 (application of the Controlled Substances Act would (1) substantially burden (2) a sincere (3) religious exercise).  The evidence the District Court found to be in equipoise related to two of the compelling interests asserted by the Government, which formed part of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative defense.  See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cGovernment may substantially burden a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion only if <em>it demonstrates</em> that application of the burden to the person\xe2\x80\x94(1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(3) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98demonstrates\xe2\x80\x99 means meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the UDV effectively demonstrated that its sincere exercise of religion was substantially burdened, and the Government failed to demonstrate that the application of the burden to the UDV would, more likely than not, be justified by the asserted compelling interests.  See 389 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1009 (Seymour, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he balance is between actual irreparable harm to [the] plaintiff and potential harm to the government which\ndoes not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest as part of its affirmative defense at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving the asserted compelling interests at the hearing on the preliminary injunction.  This argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/656/index.html">542 U. S. 656</a> (2004).  In <em>Ashcroft</em>, we affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction in a case where the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success under the compelling interest test.  We reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s the Government bears the burden of proof on the ultimate question of [the challenged Act\xe2\x80\x99s] constitutionality, respondents [the movants] must be deemed likely to prevail unless the Government has shown that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed less restrictive alternatives are less effective than [enforcing the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 666.  That logic extends to this case; here the Government failed on the first prong of the compelling interest test, and did not reach the least restrictive means prong, but that can make no difference.  The point remains that the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government attempts to limit the rule announced in <em>Ashcroft</em> to content-based restrictions on speech, but the distinction is unavailing.  The fact that <em>Ashcroft </em>involved such a restriction was the reason the Government had the burden of proof at trial under the First Amendment, see <em>id.,</em> at 665, but in no way affected the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the consequences of having that burden for purposes of the preliminary injunction.  Here the burden is placed squarely on the Government by RFRA rather than the First Amendment, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b), 2000bb\xe2\x80\x932(3), but the consequences are the same.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally mandated applications of the test, including at the preliminary injunction stage.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s second line of argument rests on the Controlled Substances Act itself.  The Government contends that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s description of Schedule I substances as having \xe2\x80\x9ca high potential for abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cno currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of accepted safety for use \xe2\x80\xa6 under medical supervision,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions such as that sought by the UDV.  The Government goes on to argue that the regulatory regime established by the Act\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d system that prohibits all use of controlled substances except as authorized by the Act itself, see <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 10)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccannot function with its necessary rigor and comprehensiveness if subjected to judicial exemptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 18.  According to the Government, there would be no way to cabin religious exceptions once recognized, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe public will misread\xe2\x80\x9d such exceptions as signaling that the substance at issue is not harmful after all.  <em>Id., </em>at 23.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, there is no need to assess the particulars of the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s use or weigh the impact of an exemption for that specific use, because the Controlled Substances Act serves a compelling purpose and simply admits of no exceptions.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Government\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach.  RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \xe2\x80\x9cto the person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b).  RFRA expressly adopted the compelling interest test \xe2\x80\x9cas set forth in <em>Sherbert</em> v. <em>Verner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/index.html"></a><a href="/us/374/398/index.html">374 U. S. 398</a> (1963) and <em>Wisconsin</em> v. <em>Yoder,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/205/index.html">406 U. S. 205</a> (1972).\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb(b)(1).  In each of those cases, this Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.  In <em>Yoder,</em> for example, we permitted an exemption for Amish children from a compulsory school attendance law.  We recognized that the State had a \xe2\x80\x9cparamount\xe2\x80\x9d interest in education, but held that \xe2\x80\x9cdespite its admitted validity in the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote \xe2\x80\xa6 and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recognizing <em>the claimed Amish exemption</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  406 U. S., at 213, 221 (emphasis added).  The Court explained that the State needed \xe2\x80\x9cto show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest \xe2\x80\xa6 would be adversely affected by granting an exemption <em>to the Amish</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 236 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Sherbert,</em> the Court upheld a particular claim to a religious exemption from a state law denying unemployment benefits to those who would not work on Saturdays, but explained that it was not announcing a constitutional right to unemployment benefits for \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> persons whose religious convictions are the cause of their unemployment.\xe2\x80\x9d  374 U. S., at 410 (emphasis added).  The Court distinguished the case \xe2\x80\x9cin which an employee\xe2\x80\x99s religious convictions serve to make him a nonproductive member of society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Smith, </em>494 U. S., at 899 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (strict scrutiny \xe2\x80\x9cat least requires a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters\xe2\x80\x9d in applying the compelling interest test, <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U.

S. 200</a>, 228 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the more focused inquiry required by RFRA and the compelling interest test, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances, as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, cannot carry the day.  It is true, of course, that Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Touby</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/160/index.html">500 U. S. 160</a>, 162 (1991).  Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue here\xe2\x80\x94the circumscribed, sacramental use of <em>hoasca </em>by the UDV.  The question of the harms from the sacramental use of <em>hoasca </em>by the UDV <em>was</em> litigated below.  Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harms, the court noted that it could not \xe2\x80\x9cignore that the legislative branch of the government elected to place materials containing DMT on Schedule I of the [Act], reflecting findings that substances containing DMT  have \xe2\x80\x98a high potential for abuse,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of [DMT] under medical supervision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1254.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its burden under RFRA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Substances Act itself.  The Act contains a provision authorizing the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cwaive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7822(d).  The fact that the Act itself contemplates that exempting certain people from its requirements would be \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the public health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that congressional findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule I ban for religious use.  For the past 35 years, there has been a regulatory exemption for use of peyote\xe2\x80\x94a Schedule I substance\xe2\x80\x94by the Native American Church.  See 21 CFR \xc2\xa71307.31 (2005).  In 1994, Congress extended that exemption to all members of every recognized Indian Tribe.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71996a(b)(1).  Everything the Government says about the DMT in <em>hoasca</em>\xe2\x80\x94that, as a Schedule I substance, Congress has determined that it \xe2\x80\x9chas a high potential for abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chas no currently accepted medical use,\xe2\x80\x9d and has \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of accepted safety for use \xe2\x80\xa6 under medical supervision,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, yet both the Executive and Congress itself have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote.  If such use is permitted in the face of the congressional findings in \xc2\xa7812(b)(1) for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, it is difficult to see how those same findings alone can preclude any consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.  See <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hialeah,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/520/index.html">508 U.

S. 535</a> (1974), but never explains what about that \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d relationship justifies overriding the same congressional findings on which the Government relies in resisting any exception for the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s religious use of <em>hoasca.  </em>In other words, if any Schedule I substance is in fact <em>always</em> highly dangerous in any amount no matter how used, what about the unique relationship with the Tribes justifies allowing their use of peyote?  Nothing about the unique political status of the Tribes makes their members immune from the health risks the Government asserts accompany any use of a Schedule I substance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes use in religious exercise from the alleged risk of diversion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that the existence of a <em>congressional</em> exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to <em>judicially crafted</em> exceptions.  RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that <em>courts </em>would recognize exceptions\xe2\x80\x94that is how the law works.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cA person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 role in the peyote exemption\xe2\x80\x94and the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s, see 21 CFR \xc2\xa71307.31 (2005)\xe2\x80\x94confirms that the findings in the Controlled Substances Act do not preclude exceptions altogether; RFRA makes clear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider whether exceptions are required under the test set forth by Congress.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The well-established peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.  The Government argues that the effectiveness of the Controlled Substances Act will be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily \xe2\x80\xa6 undercut\xe2\x80\x9d if the Act is not uniformly applied, without regard to burdens on religious exercise.  Brief for Petitioners 18.  The peyote exception, however, has been in place since the outset of the Controlled Substances Act, and there is no evidence that it has \xe2\x80\x9cundercut\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government points to some pre-<em>Smith </em>cases relying on a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause, see Brief for Petitioners 16, but those cases strike us as quite different from the present one.  Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise; they instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/index.html">455 U. S. 252</a> (1982), for example, the Court rejected a claimed exception to the obligation to pay Social Security taxes, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory participation is indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9ctax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at  258, 260.  See also <em>Hernandez</em> v. <em>Commissioner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/680/index.html">490 U. S. 680</a>, 700 (1989) (same).  In <em>Braunfeld</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/599/index.html">366 U. S. 599</a> (1961) (plurality opinion), the Court denied a claimed exception to Sunday closing laws, in part because allowing such exceptions \xe2\x80\x9cmight well provide [the claimants] with an economic advantage over their competitors who must remain closed on that day.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 608\xe2\x80\x93609.  The whole point of a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform day of rest for all workers\xe2\x80\x9d would have been defeated by exceptions.  See <em>Sherbert</em>, 374 U. S., at 408 (discussing <em>Braunfeld</em>).  These cases show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument for uniformity is different; it rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery-slope concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument echoes the classic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I make an exception for you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.  But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to \xe2\x80\x9crule[s] of general applicability.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a).  Congress determined that the legislated test \xe2\x80\x9cis a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7200bb(a)(5).  This determination finds support in our cases; in <em>Sherbert</em>, for example, we rejected a slippery-slope argument similar to the one offered in this case, dismissing as \xe2\x80\x9cno more than a possibility\xe2\x80\x9d the State\xe2\x80\x99s speculation \xe2\x80\x9cthat the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections to Saturday work\xe2\x80\x9d would drain the unemployment benefits fund.  374 U. S., at 407.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reaffirmed just last Term the feasibility of case-by-case consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules.  In <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, 544 U. S. ___ (2005), we held that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which allows federal and state prisoners to seek religious accommodations pursuant to the same standard as set forth in RFRA, does not violate the Establishment Clause.  We had \xe2\x80\x9cno cause to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that the compelling interest test \xe2\x80\x9cwould not be applied in an appropriately balanced way\xe2\x80\x9d to specific claims for exemptions as they arose.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Nothing in our opinion suggested that courts were not up to the task.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not doubt that there may be instances in which a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA.  But it would have been surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for religious use of peyote, and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb(a)(4).  And in fact the Government has not offered evidence demonstrating that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in <em>Lee</em>, <em>Hernandez</em>, and <em>Braunfeld</em>.  The Government failed to convince the District Court at the preliminary injunction hearing that health or diversion concerns provide a compelling interest in banning the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use of <em>hoasca</em>.  It cannot compensate for that failure now with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 (Deputy Solicitor General statement that exception could not be made even for \xe2\x80\x9crigorously policed\xe2\x80\x9d use of \xe2\x80\x9cone drop\xe2\x80\x9d of substance \xe2\x80\x9conce a year\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the District Court, the Government also asserted an interest in compliance with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979\xe2\x80\x931980], 32 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 543, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 9725.  The Convention, signed by the United States and implemented by the Controlled Substances Act, calls on signatories to prohibit the use of hallucinogens, including DMT.  The Government argues that it has a compelling interest in meeting its international obligations by complying with the Convention.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court rejected this interest because it found that the Convention does not cover <em>hoasca</em>.  The court relied on the official commentary to the Convention, which notes that \xe2\x80\x9cSchedule I [of the Convention] does not list \xe2\x80\xa6 natural hallucinogenic materials,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]lants as such are not, and it is submitted are also not likely to be, listed in Schedule I, but only some products obtained from plants.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0N. Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 387, 385 (1976).  The court reasoned that <em>hoasca</em>, like the plants from which the tea is made, is sufficiently distinct from DMT itself to fall outside the treaty.  See 282 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1266\xe2\x80\x931269.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not agree.  The Convention provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic substance which it contains,\xe2\x80\x9d and defines \xe2\x80\x9cpreparation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany solution or mixture, in whatever physical state, containing one or more psychotropic substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 32 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 546, Art. 1(f)(i); <em>id., </em>at 551, Art. 3.  <em>Hoasca</em> is a \xe2\x80\x9csolution or mixture\xe2\x80\x9d containing DMT; the fact that it is made by the simple process of brewing plants in water, as opposed to some more advanced method, does not change that.  To the extent the commentary suggests plants themselves are not covered by the Convention, that is of no moment\xe2\x80\x94the UDV seeks to import and use a tea brewed from plants, not the plants themselves, and the tea plainly qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreparation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that <em>hoasca</em> is covered by the Convention, however, does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use of the tea.  At the present stage, it suffices to observe that the Government did not even <em>submit</em> evidence addressing the international consequences of granting an exemption for the UDV.  The Government simply submitted two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general importance of honoring international obligations and of maintaining the leadership position of the United States in the international war on drugs.  See Declaration of Gary T. Sheridan (Jan. 24, 2001), App. G to App. to Pet. for Cert. 261a; Declaration of Robert E. Dalton (Jan. 24, 2001), App. H, <em>id., </em>at 265a.  We do not doubt the validity of these interests, any more than we doubt the general interest in promoting public health and safety by enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, but under RFRA invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government repeatedly invokes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings and purposes underlying the Controlled Substances Act, but Congress had a reason for enacting RFRA, too.  Congress recognized that \xe2\x80\x9claws \xe2\x80\x98neutral\xe2\x80\x99 toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d and legislated \xe2\x80\x9cthe compelling interest test\xe2\x80\x9d as the means for the courts to \xe2\x80\x9cstrik[e] sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

Indeed, the very sort of difficulties highlighted by the Government here were cited by this Court in deciding that the approach later mandated by Congress under RFRA was not required as a matter of constitutional law under the Free Exercise Clause.  See <em>Smith,</em> 494 U. S., at 885\xe2\x80\x93890.  But Congress has determined that courts should strike sensible balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test that requires the Government to address the particular practice at issue.  Applying that test, we conclude that the courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV\xe2\x80\x99s sacramental use of <em>hoasca</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As originally enacted, RFRA applied to States as well as the Federal Government.
