S. 191</a></p><p> view, authoritatively stated the law in effect prior to <em>Miller,</em> by which petitioners charted their course of conduct.  They focused in particular on the third part of the <em>Memoirs</em> test.  Under it, expressive material is constitutionally protected unless it is "utterly without redeeming social value."  383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/413/case.html#418">383 U. S. 418</a></span>.  Under <em>Miller,</em> the comparable test is "whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#24">413 U. S. 24</a></span>.  <em>Miller,</em> petitioners argue, casts a significantly wider net than <em>Memoirs.</em>  To apply <em>Miller</em> retroactively, and thereby punish conduct innocent under <em>Memoirs,</em> violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment -- much as retroactive application of a new statute to penalize conduct innocent when performed would violate the Constitution\'s ban on <em>ex post facto</em> laws, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 3; \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 1.  The District Court overruled these objections and instructed the jury under the <em>Miller</em> standards.  Petitioners were convicted, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and a divided Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  520 F.2d 913 (1975).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/3/386/case.html">Calder v.

But the principle on which the Clause is based -- the notion that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct which will give rise to criminal penalties -- is fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/612/case.html">United States v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 430 U.

I, \xc2\xa7 10, of the Constitution forbids. . . .  If a state legislature is barred by the <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html#353">378 U.

S. 313</a></span> (1972), we reversed a conviction under a state obscenity law because it rested on an unforeseeable judicial construction of the statute.  We stressed that reversal was mandated because affected citizens lacked fair notice that the statute would be thus applied.</p>\n<p>Relying on <em>Bouie,</em> petitioners assert that <em>Miller</em> and its companion cases unforeseeably expanded the reach of the federal obscenity statutes beyond what was punishable under <em>Memoirs.</em>  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument.  It noted -- correctly -- that the <em>Memoirs</em> standards never commanded the assent of more than three Justices at any one time, and it apparently concluded from this fact that <em>Memoirs</em> never became the law.  By this line of reasoning, one must judge whether <em>Miller</em> expanded criminal liability by looking not to <em>Memoirs,</em> but to <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">Roth v.

S. 193</a></p><p> U.S. 476 (1957), the last comparable plenary decision of this Court prior to <em>Miller</em> in which a majority united in a single opinion announcing the rationale behind the Court\'s holding. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Although certain language in <em>Roth</em> formed the basis for the plurality\'s formulation in <em>Memoirs, Roth\'s</em> test for distinguishing obscenity from protected speech was a fairly simple one to articulate:</p>\n<p>"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest."</p>\n<p>354 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#489">354 U. S. 489</a></span>.  If, indeed, <em>Roth,</em> not <em>Memoirs,</em> stated the applicable law prior to <em>Miller,</em> there would be much to commend the apparent view of the Court of Appeals that <em>Miller</em> did not significantly change the law.</p>\n<p>But we think the basic premise for this line of reasoning is faulty.  When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices,</p>\n<p>"the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Gregg v.

They reiterated their well known position that the First Amendment provides an absolute shield against governmental action aimed at suppressing obscenity.  MR.

S. 194</a></p><p> (STEWART, J., dissenting).  The view of the <em>Memoirs</em> plurality therefore constituted the holding of the Court, and provided the governing standards.  Indeed, every Court of Appeals that considered the question between <em>Memoirs</em> and <em>Miller</em> so read our decisions. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Materials were deemed to be constitutionally protected unless the prosecution carried the burden of proving that they were "utterly without redeeming social value," and otherwise satisfied the stringent <em>Memoirs</em> requirements.</p>\n<p><em>Memoirs</em> therefore was the law.  <em>Miller</em> did not simply clarify <em>Roth;</em> it marked a significant departure from <em>Memoirs.</em>  And there can be little doubt that the third test announced in <em>Miller</em> -- whether the work "lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value" -- expanded criminal liability.  The Court in <em>Miller</em> expressly observed that the "utterly without redeeming social value" test places on the prosecutor "a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof."  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#22">413 U. S. 22</a></span>.  Clearly it was thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished under <em>Memoirs</em> would result in conviction under <em>Miller.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 430 U. S. 195</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case is not strictly analogous to <em>Bouie.</em>  The statutory language there was "narrow and precise," 378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html#352">378 U. S. 352</a></span>, and that fact was important to our holding that the expansive construction adopted by the State Supreme Court deprived the accused of fair warning.  In contrast, the statute involved here always has used sweeping language to describe that which is forbidden. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  But precisely because the statute is sweeping, its reach necessarily has been confined within the constitutional limits announced by this Court.  <em>Memoirs</em> severely restricted its application.  <em>Miller</em> also restricts its application beyond what the language might indicate, but <em>Miller</em> undeniably relaxes the <em>Memoirs</em> restriction. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The effect is the same as the new construction in <em>Bouie.</em>  Petitioners, engaged in the dicey business of marketing films subject to possible challenge, had no fair warning that their products might be subjected to the new standards. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 430 U. S. 196</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We have ten special care to insist on fair warning when a statute regulates expression and implicates First Amendment values.  <em>See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html">424 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#40">424 U.

We therefore hold, in accordance with <em>Bouie,</em> that the Due Process Clause precludes the application to petitioners of the standards announced in <em>Miller v. California</em> to the extent that those standards may impose criminal liability for conduct not punishable under <em>Memoirs.</em>  Specifically, since the petitioners were indicted for conduct occurring prior to our decision in <em>Miller,</em> they are entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it finds that the materials involved are "utterly without redeeming social value." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  At the same time, we reaffirm our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 430 U. S. 197</a></p><p> holding in <em>Hamling v.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Two Courts of Appeals have found instructions derived from <em>Miller</em> appropriate in prosecutions based on conduct occurring before the <em>Miller</em> decision came down:  <em>United States v. Marks,</em> 520 F.2d 913 (CA6 1975) (the instant case); and <em>United States v. Friedman,</em> 528 F.2d 784 (CA10 1976), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 75-1663.  Three Courts of Appeals have reversed convictions where <em>Miller</em> instructions were given by the District Court:  <em>United States v. Wasserman,</em> 504 F.2d 1012 (CA5 1974); <em>United States v. Jacobs,</em> 513 F.2d 564 (CA9 1974); <em>United States v.

City of Columbia,</em> ostensibly similar to the challenge that is sustained here.  418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#115">418 U. S. 115</a></span>-116.  But the similarity is superficial only.  There the petitioners focused on part (b) of the <em>Miller</em> test.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  They argued that their convictions could not stand because <em>Miller</em> requires that the categories of material punishable under the statute must be specifically enumerated in the statute or in authoritative judicial construction.  No such limiting construction had been announced at the time they engaged in the conduct that led to their convictions.  We held that this made out no claim under <em>Bouie,</em> for part (b) did not expand the reach of the statute.</p>\n<p>"[T]he enumeration of specific categories of material in <em>Miller</em> which might be found obscene did not purport to make criminal, for the purpose of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1461, conduct which had not previously been thought criminal."</p>\n<p>418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#116">418 U. S. 116</a></span>.</p>\n<p>For the reasons noted in text, the same cannot be said of part (c) of the <em>Miller</em> test, shifting from "utterly without redeeming social value" to "lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value."  This was implicitly recognized by the Court in <em>Hamling</em> itself.  There, the trial took place before <em>Miller,</em> and the jury had been instructed in accordance with <em>Memoirs.</em>  Its verdict necessarily meant that it found the materials to be utterly without redeeming social value.  This Court examined the record and determined that the jury\'s verdict "was supported by the evidence and consistent with the <em>Memoirs</em> formulation of obscenity."  418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#100">418 U. S. 100</a></span>.  We did not avoid that inquiry on the ground that <em>Memoirs</em> had no relevance, as we might have done if <em>Miller</em> applied retroactively in all respects.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals stated, apparently without viewing the materials, 520 F.2d at 923 n. 1 (McCree, J., dissenting), that, in its opinion, the materials here were obscene under either <em>Memoirs</em> or <em>Miller.</em>  520 F.2d at 922.  Such a conclusion, absent other dependable means of knowing the character of the materials, is of dubious value.  But even if we accept the court\'s conclusion, under these circumstances, it is not an adequate substitute for the decision in the first instance of a properly instructed jury, as to this important element of the offense under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1465.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals apparently thought that our remand in <em>Miller</em> and the companion cases necessarily meant that <em>Miller</em> standards were fully retroactive.  520 F.2d at 920.  But the passage from <em>Hamling</em> quoted in the text, which simply reaffirms a principle implicit in <em>Miller,</em> makes it clear that the remands carried no such implication.  Our 1973 cases were remanded for the courts below to apply the "benefits" of <em>Miller.</em> <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>In view of our disposition of the case, we have no occasion to reach the other questions presented in the petition.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court insofar as it holds that the retroactive application of the definition of obscenity announced in <em>Miller v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U. S. 15</a></span> (1973), to the potential detriment of a criminal defendant, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  <em>See Bouie v. City of Columbia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html">378 U. S. 347</a></span> (1964).</p>\n<p>I cannot join, however, in the judgment remanding the case for a new trial.  Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1465.  I adhere to the view that this statute is "<em>clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.\'"  <em>See, e.g., Cangiano v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/934/case.html">418 U. S. 934</a></span>, 935 (1974) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), quoting <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/139/case.html">United States v.

I therefore would simply reverse.\n</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part an dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>There are three reasons which, in combination, persuade me that this criminal prosecution is constitutionally impermissible.  First, as the Court\'s opinion recognizes, this "statute regulates expression and implicates First Amendment values."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html#196">430 U. S. 196</a></span>.  However distasteful these materials are to some of us, they are nevertheless a form of communication and entertainment acceptable to a substantial segment of society; otherwise, they would have no value in the marketplace.  Second, the statute is predicated on the somewhat illogical premise that a person may be prosecuted criminally for providing another with material he has a constitutional right to possess.  <em>See Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span>.  Third, the present constitutional standards, both substantive and procedural, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html">*</a></span> which apply to these prosecutions are so intolerably vague that evenhanded enforcement of the law is a virtual impossibility.  Indeed, my brief experience on the Court has persuaded me that grossly disparate treatment of similar offenders is a characteristic of the criminal enforcement of obscenity law.  Accordingly, while I agree with everything said in the Court\'s opinion, I am unable to join its judgment remanding the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p>* How, for example, can an appellate court intelligently determine whether a jury has properly identified the relevant community standards?</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
