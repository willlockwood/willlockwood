Other federal statutes also protect the interests of children with disabilities, including Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Robinson</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 992\n, this Court considered the interaction between those other laws and the IDEA, holding that the IDEA was \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive avenue\xe2\x80\x9d through which a child with a disability could challenge the adequacy of his education.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1009.  Congress responded by passing the Handicapped Children\xe2\x80\x99s Protection Act of 1986, overturning <i>Smith</i>\xe2\x80\x99s preclusion of non-IDEA claims and adding a carefully defined exhaustion provision.

When E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s parents, petitioners Stacy and Brent Fry, sought permission for Wonder to join E.\xc2\xa0F. in kindergarten, officials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused.  The officials reasoned that the human aide provided as part of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s individualized education program rendered the dog superfluous.  In response, the Frys removed E.\xc2\xa0F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her.  They also filed a complaint with the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), claiming that the exclusion of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s service animal violated her rights under Title II and \xc2\xa7504.  OCR agreed, and school officials invited E.\xc2\xa0F. to return to Ezra Eby with Wonder.  But the Frys, concerned about resentment from school officials, instead enrolled E.\xc2\xa0F. in a different school that welcomed the service dog.  The Frys then filed this suit in federal court against Ezra Eby\xe2\x80\x99s local and regional school districts and principal (collectively, the school districts), alleging that they violated Title II and \xc2\xa7504 and seeking declaratory and monetary relief.  The District Court granted the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) required the Frys to first exhaust the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) applies whenever a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s alleged harms are \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d in nature.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exhaustion of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures is unnecessary where the gravamen of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit is something other than the denial of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s core guarantee of a FAPE.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The language of \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d under the IDEA.  Establishing the scope of \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>), then, requires identifying the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress or access a benefit.  That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme.  The IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s stated purpose and specific commands center on ensuring a FAPE for children with disabilities.  And the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures test whether a school has met this obligation: Any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(E)(i).  Accordingly, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE.  If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) merely by bringing the suit under a statute other than the IDEA.  But if the remedy sought in a suit brought under a different statute is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures is not required.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) In determining whether a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE, what matters is the gravamen of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.  That inquiry makes central the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own claims, as \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) explicitly requires in asking whether a lawsuit in fact \xe2\x80\x9cseeks\xe2\x80\x9d relief available under the IDEA.  But examination of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint should consider substance, not surface: \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.  In addressing whether a complaint fits that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities.  The IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services for children with disabilities, while Title II and \xc2\xa7504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions for people with disabilities of all ages.  That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate all three statutes.  But still, these statutory differences mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \xc2\xa7504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE obligation.  One clue to the gravamen of a complaint can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.  First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school?  Second, could an adult at the school have pressed essentially the same grievance?  When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject.  But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE.  A further sign of the gravamen of a suit can emerge from the history of the proceedings.  Prior pursuit of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative remedies may provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0This case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for a proper analysis of whether the gravamen of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE.  The Frys\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s school provided.  Instead, the Frys have maintained that the school districts infringed E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal access\xe2\x80\x94even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  But the possibility remains that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.  The parties have not addressed whether the Frys initially pursued the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative remedies, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts.  On remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s dispute resolution process before filing suit.  And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.

One of its provisions, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>), addresses the Act\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with other laws protecting those children.  Section 1415(<i>l</i>) makes clear that nothing in the IDEA \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[s] or limit[s] the rights [or] remedies\xe2\x80\x9d that other federal laws, including antidiscrimination statutes, confer on children with disabilities.

To begin, a dissatisfied parent may file a complaint as to any matter concerning the provision of a FAPE with the local or state educational agency (as state law provides).  See \xc2\xa71415(b)(6).  That pleading generally triggers a \xe2\x80\x9c[p]reliminary meeting\xe2\x80\x9d involving the contending parties, \xc2\xa71415(f\xc2\xa0)(1)(B)(i); at their option, the parties may instead (or also) pursue a full-fledged mediation process, see \xc2\xa71415(e).  Assuming their impasse continues, the matter proceeds to a \xe2\x80\x9cdue pro-cess hearing\xe2\x80\x9d before an impartial hearing officer.  \xc2\xa71415(f\xc2\xa0)(1)(A); see \xc2\xa71415(f\xc2\xa0)(3)(A)(i).

If the hearing is initially conducted at the local level, the ruling is appealable to the state agency.  See \xc2\xa71415(g).  Finally, a parent unhappy with the outcome of the administrative process may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in state or federal court.  See \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Important as the IDEA is for children with disabilities, it is not the only federal statute protecting their interests.  Of particular relevance to this case are two antidiscrimination laws\xe2\x80\x94Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712131 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7794\xe2\x80\x94which<i> </i>cover both adults and children with disabilities, in both public schools and other settings.  Title II forbids any \xe2\x80\x9cpublic entity\xe2\x80\x9d from discriminating based on disability; Section 504 applies the same prohibition to any federally funded \xe2\x80\x9cprogram or activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712131\xe2\x80\x9312132;\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7794(a).

In similar vein, courts have interpreted \xc2\xa7504 as demanding certain \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d modifications to existing practices in order to \xe2\x80\x9caccommodate\xe2\x80\x9d persons with disabilities.  <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Choate</i>,\n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287\n\xe2\x80\x93300 (1985); see, <i>e.g., Sullivan </i>v. <i>Vallejo City Unified School Dist.</i>, 731 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 947, 961\xe2\x80\x93962 (ED Cal. 1990) (requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under \xc2\xa7504).

In particular, Wonder aids E.\xc2\xa0F. by \xe2\x80\x9cretrieving dropped items, helping her balance when she uses her walker, opening and closing doors, turning on and off lights, helping her take off her coat, [and] helping her transfer to and from the toilet.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 7, \xc2\xb627.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But when the Frys sought permission for Wonder to join E.\xc2\xa0F. in kindergarten, officials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused the request.  Under E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s existing IEP, a human aide provided E.\xc2\xa0F. with one-on-one support throughout the day; that two-legged assistance, the school officials thought, rendered Wonder superfluous.  In the words of one administrator, Wonder should be barred from Ezra Eby because all of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical and academic needs [were] being met through the services/programs/accommodations\xe2\x80\x9d that the school had already agreed to.  <i>Id.,</i> at 8, \xc2\xb633.  Later that year, the school officials briefly allowed Wonder to accompany E.\xc2\xa0F. to school on a trial basis; but even then, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dog was required to remain in the back of the room during classes, and was forbidden from assisting [E.\xc2\xa0F.] with many tasks he had been specifically trained to do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.,</i> \xc2\xb635.  And when the trial period concluded, the administrators again informed the Frys that Wonder was not welcome.  As a result, the Frys removed E.\xc2\xa0F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, the Frys filed a complaint with the U.\xc2\xa0S. Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), charging that Ezra Eby\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s service animal violated her rights under Title II of the ADA and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Following an investigation, OCR agreed.  The office explained in its decision letter that a school\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services: A school could offer a FAPE to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws\xe2\x80\x99 ban on discrimination.  See App. 30\xe2\x80\x9332.  And here, OCR found, Ezra Eby had indeed violated that ban, even if its use of a human aide satisfied the FAPE standard.  See <i>id.,</i> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  OCR analogized the school\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried\xe2\x80\x9d by an aide or \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] a blind student to be led [around by a] teacher\xe2\x80\x9d instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane.  <i>Id.,</i> at 35.  Regardless whether those\xe2\x80\x94or Ezra Eby\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94policies denied a FAPE, they violated Title II and \xc2\xa7504 by discriminating against children with disabilities.  See <i>id.,</i> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In response to OCR\xe2\x80\x99s decision, school officials at last agreed that E.\xc2\xa0F. could come to school with Wonder.  But after meeting with Ezra Eby\xe2\x80\x99s principal, the Frys became concerned that the school administration \xe2\x80\x9cwould resent [E.\xc2\xa0F.] and make her return to school difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief in Opposition 10, \xc2\xb648.  Accordingly, the Frys found a different public school, in a different district, where administrators and teachers enthusiastically received both E.\xc2\xa0F. and Wonder.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Frys then filed this suit in federal court against the local and regional school districts in which Ezra Eby is located, along with the school\xe2\x80\x99s principal (collectively, the school districts).  The complaint alleged that the school districts violated Title II of the ADA and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act by \xe2\x80\x9cdenying [E.\xc2\xa0F.] equal access\xe2\x80\x9d to Ezra Eby and its programs, \xe2\x80\x9crefus[ing] to reasonably accommodate\xe2\x80\x9d E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s use of a service animal, and otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ing] against [E.\xc2\xa0F.] as a person with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 15, \xc2\xb668, 17\xe2\x80\x9318, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb682\xe2\x80\x9383.  According to the complaint, E.\xc2\xa0F. suffered harm as a result of that discrimination, including \xe2\x80\x9cemotional distress and pain, embarrassment, [and] mental anguish.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, \xc2\xb651.  In their prayer for relief, the Frys sought a declaration that the school districts had violated Title II and \xc2\xa7504, along with money damages to compensate for E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s injuries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court granted the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) required the Frys to first exhaust the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 50.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  In that court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) applies if \xe2\x80\x9cthe injuries [alleged in a suit] relate to the specific substantive protections of the IDEA.\xe2\x80\x9d  788 F.\xc2\xa03d 622, 625 (2015).  And that means, the court continued, that exhaustion is necessary whenever \xe2\x80\x9cthe genesis and the manifestations\xe2\x80\x9d of the complained-of harms were \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d in nature.  <i>Id.,</i> at 627 (quoting <i>Charlie F. </i>v. <i>Board of Ed. of Skokie School Dist. 68</i>, 98 F.\xc2\xa03d 989, 993 (CA7 1996)).  On that understanding of \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>), the Sixth Circuit held, the Frys\xe2\x80\x99 suit could not proceed: Because the harms to E.\xc2\xa0F. were generally \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94most notably, the court reasoned, because \xe2\x80\x9cWonder\xe2\x80\x99s absence hurt her sense of independence and social confidence at school\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Frys had to exhaust the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures.  788 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 627.  Judge Daugh-trey dissented, emphasizing that in bringing their Title II and \xc2\xa7504 claims, the Frys \xe2\x80\x9cdid not allege the denial of a FAPE\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cseek to modify [E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s] IEP in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 634.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to address confusion in the courts of appeals as to the scope of \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement.  579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  We now vacate the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 1415(<i>l</i>) requires that a plaintiff exhaust the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures before filing an action under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws when (but only when) her suit \xe2\x80\x9cseek[s] relief that is also available\xe2\x80\x9d under the IDEA.  We first hold that to meet that statutory standard, a suit must seek relief for the denial of a FAPE, because that is the only \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d the IDEA makes \xe2\x80\x9cavail-able.\xe2\x80\x9d  We next conclude that in determining whether a suit indeed \xe2\x80\x9cseeks\xe2\x80\x9d relief for such a denial, a court should look to the substance, or gravamen, of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In this Court, the parties have reached substantial agreement about what \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d the IDEA makes \xe2\x80\x9cavail-able\xe2\x80\x9d for children with disabilities\xe2\x80\x94and about how the Sixth Circuit went wrong in addressing that question.  The Frys maintain that such a child can obtain remedies under the IDEA for decisions that deprive her of a FAPE, but none for those that do not.  So in the Frys\xe2\x80\x99 view, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement can come into play only when a suit concerns the denial of a FAPE\xe2\x80\x94and not, as the Sixth Circuit held, when it merely has some articulable connection to the education of a child with a disability.  See Reply Brief 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  The school districts, for their part, also believe that the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion standard \xe2\x80\x9cgoes too far\xe2\x80\x9d because it could mandate exhaustion when a plaintiff is \xe2\x80\x9cseeking relief that is <i>not</i> in substance avail-able\xe2\x80\x9d under the IDEA.  Brief for Respondents 30.  And in particular, the school districts acknowledge that the IDEA makes remedies available only in suits that \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly implicate[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d a FAPE\xe2\x80\x94so that only in those suits can \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) apply.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  For the reasons that follow, we agree with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 shared view: The only relief that an IDEA officer can give\xe2\x80\x94hence the thing a plaintiff must seek in order to trigger \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion rule\xe2\x80\x94is relief for the denial of a FAPE.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We begin, as always, with the statutory language at issue, which (at risk of repetition) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d under the IDEA.  The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of a lawsuit is the \xe2\x80\x9credress[\xc2\xa0] or benefit\xe2\x80\x9d that attends a favor-able judgment.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1161 (5th ed. 1979).  And such relief is \xe2\x80\x9cavailable,\xe2\x80\x9d as we recently explained, when it is \xe2\x80\x9caccessible or may be obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ross</i> v. <i>Blake</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8) (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 150 (1993)).  So to establish the scope of \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>), we must identify the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress (or, similarly, to access a benefit).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme.  In its first section, the IDEA declares as its first purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A).  That principal purpose then becomes the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal command: A State receiving federal funding under the IDEA must make such an education \xe2\x80\x9cavailable to all children with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71412(a)(1)(A).  The guarantee of a FAPE to those children gives rise to the bulk of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s more specific provisions.  For example, the IEP\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe centerpiece of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s education delivery system\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94serves as the \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of providing a FAPE.  <i>Honig</i>, 484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311; <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 181; see <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And finally, as all the above suggests, the FAPE requirement provides the yardstick for measuring the adequacy of the education that a school offers to a child with a disability: Under that standard, this Court has held, a child is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful\xe2\x80\x9d access to education based on her individual needs.  <i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures test whether a school has met that obligation\xe2\x80\x94and so center on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE requirement.  As noted earlier, any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f\xc2\xa0)(3)(E)(i); see <i>supra,</i> at 3.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Or said in Latin: In the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative process, a FAPE denial is the <i>sine qua non</i>.  Suppose that a parent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint protests a school\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide some accommodation for a child with a disability.  If that accommodation is needed to fulfill the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE requirement, the hearing officer must order relief.  But if it is not, he cannot\xe2\x80\x94even though the dispute is between a child with a disability and the school she attends.  There might be good reasons, unrelated to a FAPE, for the school to make the requested accommodation.  Indeed, another federal law (like the ADA or Rehabilitation Act) might <i>require </i>the accommodation on one of those alternative grounds.  See <i>infra</i>, at 15.  But still, the hearing officer cannot provide the requested relief.  His role, under the IDEA, is to enforce the child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right\xe2\x80\x9d to a FAPE.  <i>Smith, </i>468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 1010.  And that is all.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For that reason, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a free appropriate public education.  If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) merely by bringing her suit under a statute other than the IDEA\xe2\x80\x94as when, for example, the plaintiffs in <i>Smith </i>claimed that a school\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide a FAPE also violated the Rehabilitation Act.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Rather, that plaintiff must first submit her case to an IDEA hearing officer, experienced in addressing exactly the issues she raises.  But if, in a suit brought under a different statute, the remedy sought is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures is not required.  After all, the plaintiff could not get any relief from those procedures: A hearing officer, as just explained, would have to send her away empty-handed.  And that is true even when the suit arises directly from a school\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of a child with a disability\xe2\x80\x94and so could be said to relate in some way to her education.  A school\xe2\x80\x99s conduct toward such a child\xe2\x80\x94say, some refusal to make an accommodation\xe2\x80\x94might injure her in ways unrelated to a FAPE, which are addressed in statutes other than the IDEA.  A complaint seeking redress for those other harms, independent of any FAPE denial, is not subject to \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion rule because, once again, the only \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d the IDEA makes \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d is relief for the denial of a FAPE.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Still, an important question remains: How is a court to tell when a plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cseeks\xe2\x80\x9d relief for the denial of a FAPE and when she does not?  Here, too, the parties have found some common ground: By looking, they both say, to the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d of, rather than the labels used in, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  Brief for Respondents 20; Reply Brief 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And here, too, we agree with that view: What matters is the crux\xe2\x80\x94or, in legal-speak, the gravamen\xe2\x80\x94of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That inquiry makes central the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own claims, as \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) explicitly requires.  The statutory language asks whether a lawsuit in fact \xe2\x80\x9cseeks\xe2\x80\x9d relief available under the IDEA\xe2\x80\x94not, as a stricter exhaustion statute might, whether the suit \xe2\x80\x9ccould have sought\xe2\x80\x9d relief avail-able under the IDEA (or, what is much the same, whether any remedies \xe2\x80\x9care\xe2\x80\x9d available under that law).  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20 (contrasting \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) with the exhaustion provision in the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a)).  In effect, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) treats the plaintiff as \xe2\x80\x9cthe master of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d: She identifies its remedial basis\xe2\x80\x94and is subject to exhaustion or not based on that choice.  <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386\n, and n.\xc2\xa07 (1987).  A court deciding whether \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) applies must therefore examine whether a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint\xe2\x80\x94the principal instrument by which she describes her case\xe2\x80\x94seeks relief for the de-nial of an appropriate education.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that examination should consider substance, not surface.  The use (or non-use) of particular labels and terms is not what matters.  The inquiry, for example, does not ride on whether a complaint includes (or, alternatively, omits) the precise words(?) \xe2\x80\x9cFAPE\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIEP.\xe2\x80\x9d  After all, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s premise is that the plaintiff is suing under a statute <i>other than </i>the IDEA, like the Rehabilitation Act; in such a suit, the plaintiff might see no need to use the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive language\xe2\x80\x94even if she is in essence contesting the adequacy of a special education program.  And still more critically, a \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d approach would make \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion rule too easy to bypass.  Just last Term, a similar worry led us to hold that a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act turns on the \xe2\x80\x9cgravamen,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cessentials,\xe2\x80\x9d of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  <i>OBB Personenverkehr AG</i> v. <i>Sachs</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6, 8, 9).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny other approach,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwould allow plaintiffs to evade the Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions through artful pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  So too here.  Section 1415(<i>l</i>) is not merely a pleading hurdle.  It requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addressing whether a complaint fits that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities\xe2\x80\x94the IDEA on the one hand, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act (most notably) on the other.  The IDEA, of course, protects only \xe2\x80\x9cchildren\xe2\x80\x9d (well, really, adolescents too) and concerns only their schooling.  \xc2\xa71412(a)(1)(A).  And as earlier noted, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to provide each child with meaningful access to education by offering individualized instruction and related services appropriate to her \xe2\x80\x9cunique needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71401(29); see <i>Rowley</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192, 198; <i>supra,</i> at 11.  By contrast, Title II of the ADA and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act cover people with disabilities of all ages, and do so both inside and outside schools.  And those statutes aim to root out disability-based discrimination, enabling each covered person (sometimes by means of reasonable accommodations) to participate equally to all others in public facilities and federally funded programs.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In short, the IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services, while Title II and \xc2\xa7504 promise non-discriminatory access to public institutions.  That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate all three statutes\xe2\x80\x94which is why, as in <i>Smith</i>, a plaintiff might seek relief for the denial of a FAPE under Title II and \xc2\xa7504 as well as the IDEA.  But still, the statutory differences just discussed mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \xc2\xa7504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s FAPE obligation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One clue to whether the gravamen of a complaint against a school concerns the denial of a FAPE, or instead addresses disability-based discrimination, can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.  First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was <i>not </i>a school\xe2\x80\x94say, a public theater or library?  And second, could an <i>adult </i>at the school\xe2\x80\x94say, an employee or visitor\xe2\x80\x94have pressed essentially the same grievance?  When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject; after all, in those other situations there is no FAPE obligation and yet the same basic suit could go forward.  But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE, even if it does not explicitly say so; for the FAPE requirement is all that explains why only a child in the school setting (not an adult in that setting or a child in some other) has a viable claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take two contrasting examples.  Suppose first that a wheelchair-bound child sues his school for discrimination under Title II (again, without mentioning the denial of a FAPE) because the building lacks access ramps.  In some sense, that architectural feature has educational consequences, and a different lawsuit might have alleged that it violates the IDEA: After all, if the child cannot get inside the school, he cannot receive instruction there; and if he must be carried inside, he may not achieve the sense of independence conducive to academic (or later to real-world) success.  But is the denial of a FAPE really the gravamen of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s Title II complaint?  Consider that the child could file the same basic complaint if a municipal library or theater had no ramps.  And similarly, an employee or visitor could bring a mostly identical complaint against the school.  That the claim can stay the same in those alternative scenarios suggests that its essence is equality of access to public facilities, not adequacy of special education.  See <i>supra,</i> at 7 (describing OCR\xe2\x80\x99s use of a similar example).  And so \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) does not require exhaustion.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But suppose next that a student with a learning disability sues his school under Title II for failing to provide remedial tutoring in mathematics.  That suit, too, might be cast as one for disability-based discrimination, grounded on the school\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to make a reasonable accommo-dation; the complaint might make no reference at all to a FAPE or an IEP.  But can anyone imagine the student making the same claim against a public theater or library?  Or, similarly, imagine an adult visitor or employee suing the school to obtain a math tutorial?  The difficulty of transplanting the complaint to those other contexts suggests that its essence\xe2\x80\x94even though not its wording\xe2\x80\x94is the provision of a FAPE, thus bringing \xc2\xa71415(<i>l\xc2\xa0</i>) into play.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A further sign that the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a FAPE can emerge from the history of the proceedings.  In particular, a court may consider that a plaintiff has previously invoked the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s formal procedures to handle the dispute\xe2\x80\x94thus starting to exhaust the Act\xe2\x80\x99s remedies before switching midstream.  Recall that a parent dissatisfied with her child\xe2\x80\x99s education initiates those administrative procedures by filing a complaint, which triggers a preliminary meeting (or possibly mediation) and then a due process hearing.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  A plain-tiff\xe2\x80\x99s initial choice to pursue that process may suggest that she is indeed seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE\xe2\x80\x94with the shift to judicial proceedings prior to full exhaustion reflecting only strategic calculations about how to maximize the prospects of such a remedy.  Whether that is so depends on the facts; a court may conclude, for example, that the move to a courtroom came from a late-acquired awareness that the school had fulfilled its FAPE obligation and that the grievance involves something else entirely.  But prior pursuit of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative reme-dies will often provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals did not undertake the analysis we have just set forward.  As noted above, it asked whether E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s injuries were, broadly speaking, \xe2\x80\x9ceducational\xe2\x80\x9d in nature.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8; 788 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 627 (reasoning that the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of allowing Wonder to attend [school] with E.\xc2\xa0F. was educational\xe2\x80\x9d because it would foster \xe2\x80\x9cher sense of independence and social confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is \xe2\x80\x9cthe sort of interest the IDEA protects\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is not the same as asking whether the gravamen of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE.  And that difference in standard may have led to a difference in result in this case.  Understood correctly, \xc2\xa71415(<i>l</i>) might not require exhaustion of the Frys\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  We lack some important information on that score, however, and so we remand the issue to the court below.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Frys\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the ade-quacy of the special education services E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s school provided.  The school districts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crefusal to allow Wonder to act as a service dog,\xe2\x80\x9d the complaint states, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminated against [E.\xc2\xa0F.] as a person with disabilities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by denying her equal access\xe2\x80\x9d to public facilities.  App. to Brief in Opposition 15, Complaint \xc2\xb668.  The complaint contains no allegation about the denial of a FAPE or about any deficiency in E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s IEP.  More, it does not accuse the school even in general terms of refusing to provide the educational instruction and services that E.\xc2\xa0F. needs.  See 788 F. 3d, at 631 (acknowledging that the Frys do not \xe2\x80\x9cstate that Wonder enhances E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s educational opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Frys explained in this Court: The school districts \xe2\x80\x9chave said all along that because they gave [E.\xc2\xa0F.] a one-on-one [human] aide, that all of her .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. educational needs were satisfied.  And we have not challenged that, and it would be difficult for us to challenge that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  The Frys instead maintained, just as OCR had earlier found, that the school districts infringed E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal access\xe2\x80\x94even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  See App. to Brief in Opposition 15, 18\xe2\x80\x9319, Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 69, 85, 87; App. 34\xe2\x80\x9337; <i>supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And nothing in the nature of the Frys\xe2\x80\x99 suit suggests any implicit focus on the adequacy of E.\xc2\xa0F.\xe2\x80\x99s education.  Consider, as suggested above, that the Frys could have filed essentially the same complaint if a public library or theater had refused admittance to Wonder.  See <i>supra,</i> at 16.  Or similarly, consider that an adult visitor to the school could have leveled much the same charges if prevented from entering with his service dog.  See <i>ibid.  </i>In each case, the plaintiff would challenge a public facility\xe2\x80\x99s policy of precluding service dogs (just as a blind person might challenge a policy of barring guide dogs, see <i>supra</i>, at 7) as violating Title II\xe2\x80\x99s and \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s equal access requirements.  The suit would have nothing to do with the provision of educational services.  From all that we know now, that is exactly the kind of action the Frys have brought.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But we do not foreclose the possibility that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.  As earlier discussed, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s initial pursuit of the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative remedies can serve as evidence that the gravamen of her later suit is the denial of a FAPE, even though that does not appear on the face of her complaint.  See <i>supra,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The Frys may or may not have sought those remedies before filing this case: None of the parties here have addressed that issue, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts.  Accordingly, on remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s dispute resolution process before bringing this suit.  And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With these instructions and for the reasons stated,we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0At the time (and until 1990), the IDEA was called the Education of the Handicapped Act, or EHA.

They suppose that a teacher, acting out of animus or frustration, strikes a student with a disability, who then sues the school under a statute other than the IDEA.

But the school districts opine, we think correctly, that the substance of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim is unlikely to involve the adequacy of special education\xe2\x80\x94and thus is unlikely to require exhaustion.  See <i>ibid. </i> A telling indicator of that conclusion is that a child could file the same kind of suit against an official at another public facility for inflicting such physical abuse\xe2\x80\x94as could an adult subject to similar treatment by a school official.

This clue also seems to me to be ill-advised.  It is easy to imagine circumstances under which parents might start down the IDEA road and then change course and file an action under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that seeks relief that the IDEA cannot provide.  The parents might be advised by their attorney that the relief they were seeking under the IDEA is not available under that law but is available under another.  Or the parents might change their minds about the relief that they want, give up on the relief that the IDEA can provide, and turn to another statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the Court provides these clues for the purpose of assisting the lower courts, I am afraid that they may have the opposite effect.
