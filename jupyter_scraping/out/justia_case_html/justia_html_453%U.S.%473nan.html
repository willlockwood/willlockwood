One of petitioner\'s employees (also a respondent), working on an oil drilling platform above the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf, was injured while, because of a storm, he was being evacuated from the platform aboard a boat chartered by Mobil.  The employee brought suit for damages in a Texas state court, alleging negligence by Mobil and the boat owner.  Mobil filed a third-party complaint for indemnification against petitioner.  The trial court rejected petitioner\'s contention that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint because Mobil\'s cause of action arose under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which vested exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in a federal district court.  During the trial, the court denied petitioner\'s request to instruct the jury that personal injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation and that they should not increase or decrease an award in contemplation of tax consequences.  The jury found Mobil negligent and awarded the employee $900,000 for his injuries.  It also found that the employee sustained his injuries while performing work subject to the contract of indemnification.  The court then entered judgment against petitioner in the amount of $900,000.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, and the Texas Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

However, OCSLA mandates that the law of the adjacent State (Louisiana here) applies as federal law "[t]o the extent [it is] not inconsistent" with federal law.  The question whether this incorporation of state law precludes a court from finding that state law is "inconsistent" with the federal common law rule announced in <em>Liepelt</em> need be answered here only if Louisiana law would not require that the damages instruction be given upon timely request.

We also consider whether the rule of <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Liepelt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/490/case.html">444 U. S. 490</a></span> (1980), that the jury be instructed that personal injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation, is applicable to such a case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent, Mobil Oil Corp., contracted with petitioner, Gulf Offshore Co., for the latter to perform certain completion operations on oil drilling platforms offshore of Louisiana.  As part of the agreement, petitioner promised to indemnify Mobil for all claims resulting directly or indirectly from the work.  While the work was in progress in September, 1975, the advent of Hurricane Eloise required that workers be evacuated from oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Steven Gaedecke was an employee of petitioner working on an oil drilling platform above the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf.  As the storm approached, a boat chartered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 453 U. S. 476</a></p><p> by Mobil took him safely aboard.  Shortly thereafter, while assisting crewmen attempting to evacuate other workers from the platforms in turbulent sea, he was washed across the deck of the vessel by a wave.  He suffered injuries, primarily to his back.</p>\n<p>Gaedecke brought this suit for damages in the District Court of Harris County, a Texas state court alleging negligence by Mobil and the boat owner.  Mobil filed a third-party complaint for indemnification against petitioner. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In its third-party answer, petitioner denied that the state court had subject matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint.  Petitioner argued that Mobil\'s cause of action arose under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), and that OCSLA vested exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in a United States district court.  The Texas trial court rejected this contention, and the case went to trial before a jury.</p>\n<p>In submitting the case to the jury, the trial court denied a request by petitioner to instruct them that personal injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation and that they should not increase or decrease an award in contemplation of tax consequences.  The jury found Mobil negligent and awarded Gaedecke $900,000 for his injuries.  The jury also found, however, that Gaedecke sustained his injuries while performing work subject to the contract of indemnification.  Based on the two verdicts, the trial judge entered judgment against petitioner in the amount of $900,000.</p>\n<p>The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed.  594 S.W.2d 496 (1979).  It held that the Texas state courts had subject </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 453 U. S. 477</a></p><p> matter jurisdiction over the causes of action. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It acknowledged that OCSLA governed the case, but found no explicit command in the Act that federal court jurisdiction be exclusive.  The court also observed that exclusive federal court jurisdiction was unnecessary, because the Act incorporates as federal law in personal injury actions the laws of the State adjacent to the scene of the events, when not inconsistent with other federal laws.  43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(2).  Thus, the court reasoned, "[t]he end result would be an application of the same laws no matter where the forum was located, whether state or federal."  594 S.W.2d at 502.  The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation.  The Texas Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict over whether federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over suits arising under OCSLA [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and to consider whether an instruction that damages are not taxable is appropriate in such a case.  449 U.S. 1033 (1980).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The general principle of state court jurisdiction over cases arising under federal laws is straightforward:  state courts may assume subject matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action absent provision by Congress to the contrary or disabling incompatibility between the federal claim and state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 453 U.

S. 136</a></span> (1876).  This rule is premised on the relation between the States and the National Government within our federal system, <em>see</em> The Federalist No. 82 (Hamilton).  The two exercise concurrent sovereignty, although the Constitution limits the powers of each and requires the States to recognize federal law as paramount.  Federal law confers rights binding on state courts, the subject matter jurisdiction of which is governed in the first instance by state laws. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In considering the propriety of state court jurisdiction over any particular federal claim, the Court begins with the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction.  <em>See California v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/59/case.html">440 U. S. 59</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/59/case.html#66">440 U.

Congress, however, may confine jurisdiction to the federal courts either explicitly or implicitly.  Thus, the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests.  <em>See ibid.; Claflin, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html#137">93 U.

Congress did grant United States district courts "original </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 453 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It is black letter law, however, that the mere grant of jurisdiction to a federal court does not operate to oust a state court from concurrent jurisdiction over the cause of action.

This argument is premised on a perceived incompatibility between exclusive federal sovereignty over the Outer Continental Shelf and state court jurisdiction over controversies relating to the Shelf.  We think petitioner mistakes the purpose of OCSLA and the policies necessitating exclusive federal court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>OCSLA extends the "Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States" to the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf and to "artificial islands and fixed structures" built for discovery, extraction, and transportation of minerals.  43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(1).  All law applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf is federal law, but to fill the substantial "gaps" in the coverage of federal law, OCSLA borrows the "applicable and not inconsistent" laws of the adjacent States as surrogate federal law.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 453 U.

Thus, a personal injury action involving events occurring on the Shelf is governed by federal law, the content of which is borrowed from the law of the adjacent State, here, Louisiana.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/352/case.html#362">395 U.

This argument again confuses the political jurisdiction of a State with its judicial jurisdiction.  Section 1333(a)(3) speaks to the geographic boundaries of state sovereignty, because Congress primarily was concerned in enacting OCSLA to assure federal control over the Shelf and its resources.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em>  The language of the provision refers to "any interest in or jurisdiction over" real property, minerals, and revenues, not over causes of action.  Indeed, opponents of OCSLA urged Congress to extend the political boundaries of the States seaward over the Shelf, at least for some purposes.  <em>See</em> 99 Cong.Rec. 7230 (remarks of Sen. Ellender), 7232 (remark of Sen. Long) (1953).  The Senate Report explains that \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(3) was intended to make plain that the adoption of state law as federal law cannot be the basis for a claim by the State "for participation in the administration of or revenues from the areas outside of State boundaries."  1953 S.Rep. at 23.</p>\n<p>We do not think the legislative history of OCSLA can be read to rebut the presumption of concurrent state court jurisdiction, given Congress\' silence on the subject in the statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 453 U. S. 483</a></p><p> itself.  Petitioner relies principally on criticisms by the two Senators from Louisiana, Ellender and Long, who opposed the bill that eventually became OCSLA. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Yet "[t]he fears and doubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to the construction of legislation."  <em>Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html">341 U.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Moreover, the amendments offered by the Senators sought to confer political control over the Shelf and its mineral wealth on the States, not jurisdiction on the state courts over OCSLA cases.  <em>See</em> 9 Cong.Rec. 7230 (Sen. Ellender), 7232 (Sen. Long) (1953). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The operation of OCSLA will not be frustrated by state court jurisdiction over personal injury actions.  The factors generally recommending exclusive federal court jurisdiction over an area of federal law include [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] the desirability of uniform </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 453 U. S. 484</a></p><p> interpretation, the expertise of federal judges in federal law, and the assumed greater hospitality of federal courts to peculiarly federal claims. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  These factors cannot support exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims whose governing rules are borrowed from state law.  There is no need for uniform interpretation of laws that vary from State to State.  State judges have greater expertise in applying these laws and certainly cannot be thought unsympathetic to a claim only because it is labeled federal, rather than state, law.</p>\n<p>Allowing personal injury and contract actions in state courts will advance interests identified by Congress in enacting OCSLA.  A recurring consideration in the deliberations leading to enactment was</p>\n<p>"the special relationship between the men working on these [platforms] and the adjacent shore to which they commute to visit their families."</p>\n<p><em>Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty Co.,</em> 395 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/352/case.html#365">395 U. S. 365</a></span>.  Allowing state court jurisdiction over these cases will allow these workers, and their lawyers, to pursue individual claims in familiar, convenient, and possibly less expensive fora.  <em>See Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#103">404 U. S. 103</a></span> (state statute of limitations applies to personal injury actions arising under OCSLA).</p>\n<p>In summary, nothing in the language, structure, legislative history, or underlying policies of OCSLA suggests that Congress intended federal courts to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over personal injury actions arising under OCSLA.  The Texas courts had jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Civil Appeals held that petitioner was not entitled to an instruction cautioning the jury that personal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 453 U. S. 485</a></p><p> injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation, \xc2\xa7 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 104(a)(2).  In so ruling, the court relied on <em>Johnson v. Penrod Drilling Co.,</em> 510 F.2d 234, 236-237 (CA5) (en banc) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied,</em> 423 U.S. 839 (1975), a Jones Act case where the Court of Appeals prohibited presenting evidence or instructing the jury as to the impact of taxes on damages awards based on lost wages.  This Court subsequently held that a defendant in a suit brought under the Federal Employers\' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 51 <em>et seq.,</em> is entitled to an instruction that damages for lost future wages are not subject to federal income taxation.  <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Liepelt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/490/case.html">444 U. S. 490</a></span> (1980). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Petitioner now argues that <em>Liepelt</em> applies to an OCSLA personal injury action, and that this case should be remanded for a new trial on damages before a properly instructed jury. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Our first task is to determine the source of law that will govern whether such an instruction must be available in an OCSLA case.  OCSLA, as discussed above, mandates that state laws apply as federal laws "[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with this subchapter or with other Federal laws."  43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(2).  In any particular case, the adjacent State\'s law applies to those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 453 U. S. 486</a></p><p> areas "which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The statute thus contains a explicit choice of law provision.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em>  The parties agree that the substantive law of Louisiana applies to this case unless it is inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p>To apply the statutory directive, a court must consider the content of both potentially applicable federal and state law.  Subsequent to the decision of the Texas court, as noted above, we held in <em>Liepelt, supra,</em> that a defendant in an FELA case is entitled to an instruction that damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  As FELA afforded no guidance on this issue, the holding articulated a federal common law rule.  The purpose was to eliminate from the deliberations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 453 U. S. 487</a></p><p> of juries "an area of doubt or speculation that might have an improper impact on the computation of the amount of damages."  444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/490/case.html#498">444 U. S. 498</a></span>. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Thus, the instruction furthers strong federal policies of fairness and efficiency in litigation of federal claims.  If Congress had been silent about the source of federal law in an OCSLA personal injury case, <em>Liepelt</em> would require that the instruction be given.</p>\n<p>But Congress was not silent.  It incorporated for this case the applicable law of Louisiana, but only "[t]o the extent [it is] not inconsistent" with federal law.  The statute does not distinguish between federal statutory and judge-made law.  It would seem then that, if Louisiana law is "inconsistent," <em>Liepelt</em> controls.  Doubt arises, however, because, in OCSLA, Congress borrowed a remedy provided by state law, and thereby "specifically rejected national uniformity" as a paramount goal.  <em>Chevron Oil v. Huson,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#104">404 U. S. 104</a></span>.  In <em>Chevron,</em> we held that Louisiana, rather than federal, common law provided the federal statute of limitations for personal injury damages actions under OCSLA.  We recognized that</p>\n<p>"Congress made clear provision for filling the \'gaps\' in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 453 U. S. 488</a></p><p> federal law; it did not intend that federal courts fill those \'gaps\' themselves by creating new federal common law."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#104">404 U. S. 104</a></span>-105.  In this case, we face an analogous question:  does the incorporation of state law preclude a court from finding that state law is "inconsistent" with a federal common law rule generally applicable to federal damages actions?</p>\n<p>We need answer this question only if Louisiana law would not require that the instruction be given upon timely request.  The court below never addressed this question, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] but relied solely on federal case law now superseded.  Under these circumstances, it is the better practice to remand this case to the Texas Court of Civil Appeals for a determination of whether Louisiana law requires the instruction, and, if it does not, whether <em>Liepelt</em> displaces the state rule in an OCSLA case.  If the court decides that it was error to refuse the instruction, it may then address respondents\' argument that petitioner was not prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Mobil claimed indemnification on the grounds of both its contract with petitioner and the allegation that petitioner\'s negligence caused the accident.  Prior to trial, Gaedecke entered into a conditional settlement agreement with Mobil, which limited his potential recovery against Mobil to $200,000; in return, Mobil agreed to proceed against petitioner for indemnification only on the basis of the contract.  Gaedecke also settled his claim with the boat owner.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Texas had <em>in personam</em> jurisdiction over Mobil and petitioner, each of whom does business in Texas.  Gaedecke was a resident of Harris County, Tex.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Pool v. Kemper Ins. Group,</em> 386 So.2d 1006 (La.App.1980); <em>Friedrich v.

If Congress does not confer jurisdiction on federal courts to hear a particular federal claim, the state courts stand ready to vindicate the federal right, subject always to review, of course, in this Court.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html">Martin v.

This practical concern was more important before the statutory creation in 1875 of general federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress amended and recodified the jurisdictional provisions of OCSLA in 1978, without effecting any change that casts light on the issue of exclusive federal court jurisdiction before us today.

No. 95-1091, p. 114 (1978).  <em>But cf.</em> Pub.L. 95-372, Title II, \xc2\xa7 208(a)(2)(B), 92 Stat. 657 (contemplating suit by the Attorney General in state court to remedy violations of the Act).  The grant of jurisdiction to a federal district court is now codified at 43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1349(b)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. III).  In this opinion, we employ the Code citations prior to the recodification.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>This principle defeats petitioner\'s reliance on the provision in \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(2):  "All of such applicable laws shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the United States."  The phrase "such applicable laws" refers to the laws of the adjacent States, which \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(2) incorporates as federal law for the Outer Continental Shelf.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#480">453 U. S. 480</a></span>-481.  The language relied upon merely makes clear that these borrowed state laws are to be enforced like other federal laws, and nothing indicates an intent to exclude state courts from the subject matter jurisdiction they exercise generally over federal claims.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative history confirms that the purpose of OCSLA was</p>\n<p>"to assert the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Federal Government of the United States over the seabed and subsoil of the outer Continental Shelf, and to provide for the development of its vast mineral resources."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 411, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1953) (hereinafter 1953 S.Rep.).  Congress enacted OCSLA in the wake of decisions by this Court that the Federal Government enjoyed sovereignty and ownership of the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf to the exclusion of adjacent States.  <em>See United States v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/707/case.html">339 U. S. 707</a></span> (1950); <em>United States v.

Congress chose to retain exclusive federal control of the administration of the Shelf because it underlay the high seas and the assertion of sovereignty there implicated the foreign policies of the Nation.  <em>See</em> 1953 S.Rep. at 6.  Much of OCSLA provides a federal framework for the granting of leases for exploration and extraction of minerals from the submerged lands of the Shelf.  <em>See</em> 43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1334-1343.</p>\n<p>Congress was not unaware, however, of the close, longstanding relationship between the Shelf and the adjacent States.  <em>See</em> 1953 S.Rep. at 6.  This concern manifested itself primarily in the incorporation of the law of adjacent States to fill gaps in federal law.  <em>See Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/352/case.html">395 U.

It should be emphasized that this case only involves state court jurisdiction over actions based on incorporated state law.  We express no opinion on whether state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction over actions based on the substantive provisions of OCSLA.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>OCSLA does supersede the normal choice of law rules that the forum would apply.  <em>See Chevron Oil Co. v.

But Congress rejected the Department\'s premise that the Shelf is "not comparable to . . . federally owned areas within a State."  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See Rodrigue v.

Section 1333(a)(1) rather provides that the federal laws apply to the Shelf "to the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Senator Long did express the fear that OCSLA placed exclusive jurisdiction over all civil suits in federal district courts.  1953 S.Rep. at 66 (minority report); 99 Cong.Rec. 7233 (1953).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Most of the Senators\' statements regarding OCSLA\'s effect on state court jurisdiction criticize placing exclusive criminal jurisdiction in federal courts.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 7231-7232 (Sen.

Also, exclusive federal jurisdiction will not prevent a state court from deciding a federal question collaterally even if it would not have subject matter jurisdiction over a case raising the question directly.  <em>See</em> Note, Exclusive Jurisdiction of Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 509, 510 (1957).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Redish  Muench, Adjudication of Federal Causes of Action in State Court, 75 Mich.L.Rev. 311, 329-335 (1978); Note, 70 Harv.L.Rev. <em>supra,</em> n. 12, at 511-515.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Liepelt</em> also found error in the trial court\'s refusal to allow the defendant to introduce evidence showing the effect of income taxes on the plaintiff\'s future earnings.  444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/490/case.html#493">444 U.

Cortese,</em> 450 U.S. 981 (1981), and it followed the holding in <em>Guerra.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion as to Parts I and II, and I concur in the decision to remand this case for further proceedings as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 453 U. S. 489</a></p><p> to the applicability of the rule adopted in <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Liepelt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/490/case.html">444 U. S. 490</a></span> (1980).  I write separately because I have reservations about the Court\'s expressed intention to apply the <em>Liepelt</em> rule expansively, a ruling I consider unwise and unnecessary to this case in its present posture.</p>\n<p>As the Court makes clear, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#488">453 U. S. 488</a></span>, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, on remand, must determine, first, what Louisiana law requires as to this form of instruction, and, second, whether that state rule is "inconsistent" with OCSLA or "other Federal laws."  43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1333(a)(2).  The Court acknowledges, and I agree, that the choice of law provision contained in OCSLA creates "[d]oubt," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#487">453 U. S. 487</a></span>, as to whether Congress intended state law or federal law to govern the grant of this instruction.  As I understand OCSLA, the purpose of incorporating state law was to permit actions arising on these federal lands to be determined by rules essentially the same as those applicable to actions arising on the bordering state lands.  Congress apparently intended to provide a kind of local uniformity of result, regardless of whether the action arose on shelf lands or on neighboring state lands.  I would read the statute, thus, to encourage use of state law, and I would permit the state court to weigh, as an initial matter and only if the Louisiana rule differs from the <em>Liepelt</em> rule, whether Congress\' desire for local uniformity outweighs any perceived need, as a matter of federal common law, for the instruction.  I do not find it self-evident that <em>Liepelt</em> created a general "federal common law rule" that so greatly "furthers strong federal policies of fairness and efficiency in litigation of federal claims," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#486">453 U. S. 486</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#487">453 U. S. 487</a></span>, as to require its application in cases governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.  In my view, this question was not settled in <em>Liepelt,</em> and it remains open for future adjudication.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
