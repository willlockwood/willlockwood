S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  The District Court dismissed in part on the ground that the allegations did not show that Arizona law would impose liability upon a private person in similar circumstances.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning from two premises: (1) Where unique governmental functions are at issue, the Act waives sovereign immunity if a state or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred, and (2) federal mine inspections are such unique governmental functions since there is no private-sector analogue for mine inspections.  Because Arizona law would make a state or municipal entity liable in the circumstances alleged, the Circuit concluded that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity was waived.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Under \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), the United States waives sovereign immunity only where local law would make a \xe2\x80\x9cprivate person\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>liable in tort, not where local law would make \xe2\x80\x9ca state or municipal entity\xe2\x80\x9d liable.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s first premise is too broad, reading into the Act something that is not there.  Section 1346(b)(1) says that it waives sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances where the United States, if a<em> private person</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States, if a state or municipal entity,\xe2\x80\x9d would be liable.  (Emphasis added.)  This Court has consistently adhered to this \xe2\x80\x9cprivate person\xe2\x80\x9d standard, even when uniquely governmental functions are at issue.  <em>Indian Towing Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/61/index.html">350 U.

Even though both these cases involved Government efforts to <em>escape </em>liability by pointing to the <em>absence </em>of municipal entity liability, there is no reason for treating differently a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s effort to <em>base </em>liability solely upon the fact that a State would impose liability upon a state governmental entity.  Nothing in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s context, history, or objectives or in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions suggests otherwise.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s second premise reads the Act too narrowly.  Section 2674 makes the United States liable \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under <em>like</em> <em>circumstances</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The words \xe2\x80\x9clike circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d do not restrict a court\'s inquiry to the <em>same circumstances, </em>but require it to look further afield.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Indian Towing</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 64.  The Government in effect concedes, and other Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions applying <em>Indian Towing</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic suggest, that private person analogies exist for the federal mine inspectors\xe2\x80\x99 conduct at issue.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  We here interpret these words to mean what they say, namely, that the United States waives sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d where local law would make a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>private person</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>liable in tort.  (Emphasis added.)  And we reverse a line of Ninth Circuit precedent permitting courts in certain circumstances to base a waiver simply upon a finding that local law would make a \xe2\x80\x9cstate or municipal entit[y]\xe2\x80\x9d liable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hines</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d 1442, 1448 (1995); <em>Cimo</em> v. <em>INS</em>, 16 F.\xc2\xa03d 1039, 1041 (1994); <em>Cameron</em> v. <em>Janssen Bros.

The Federal District Court dismissed the lawsuit in part upon the ground that their allegations were insufficient to show that Arizona law would impose liability upon a private person in similar circumstances.  The Ninth Circuit, in a brief <em>per curiam</em> opinion, reversed this determination.  It reasoned from two premises.  First, where \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unique governmental functions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are at issue, the Act waives sovereign immunity if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a state or municipal entity would be [subject to liability] under the law [\xe2\x80\xa6] where the activity occurred.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  362 F.\xc2\xa03d 1236, 1240 (2004) (citing <em>Hines</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 1448, and quoting <em>Doggett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 689, and <em>Concrete Tie of San Diego, Inc.</em> v. <em>Liberty Constr., Inc.</em>, 107 F.\xc2\xa03d 1368, 1371 (CA9 1997))<em>.  </em>Second, federal mine inspections being regulatory in nature are such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unique governmental functions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no private-sector analogue for mine inspections.\xe2\x80\x9d  362 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1240 (quoting in part <em>Doggett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 689). <em> </em>The Circuit then held that Arizona law would make \xe2\x80\x9cstate or municipal entities\xe2\x80\x9d liable in the circumstances alleged; hence the FTCA waives the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity.  362 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1240.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>We disagree with both of the Ninth Circuit\'s legal premises.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first premise is too broad, for it reads into the Act something that is not there.  The Act says that it waives sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances where the United States, if a<em> private person</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States, if a state or municipal entity,\xe2\x80\x9d would be liable.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Our cases have consistently adhered to this \xe2\x80\x9cprivate person\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  In <em>Indian Towing Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/61/index.html">350 U. S. 61</a>, 64 (1955), this Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno liability for negligent performance of \xe2\x80\x98uniquely governmental functions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  It held that the Act requires a court to look to the state-law liability of private entities, not to that of public entities, when assessing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s liability under the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cin the performance of activities which private persons do not perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Rayonier Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/315/index.html">352 U. S. 315</a>, 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (1957), the Court rejected a claim that the scope of FTCA liability for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98uniquely governmental\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d functions depends on whether state law \xe2\x80\x9cimposes liability on municipal or other local governments for the negligence of their agents acting in\xe2\x80\x9d similar circumstances.  And even though both these cases involved Government efforts to <em>escape </em>liability by pointing to the <em>absence </em>of municipal entity liability, we are unaware of any reason for treating differently a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s effort to <em>base </em>liability solely upon the fact that a State would impose liability upon a municipal (or other state governmental) entity.  Indeed, we have found nothing in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s context, history, or objectives or in the opinions of this Court suggesting a waiver of sovereign immunity solely upon that basis.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s second premise rests upon a reading of the Act that is too narrow.  The Act makes the United States liable \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under <em>like</em> <em>circumstances</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72674 (emphasis added).  As this Court said in <em>Indian Towing, </em>the words \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98like circumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d do not restrict a court\'s inquiry to the <em>same circumstances, </em>but require it to look further afield.  350 U. S., at 64; see also S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 32 (1946) (purpose of FTCA was to make the tort liability of the United States \xe2\x80\x9cthe same as that of a private person under like circumstance, in accordance with the local law\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court there considered a claim that the Coast Guard, responsible for operating a lighthouse, had failed \xe2\x80\x9cto check\xe2\x80\x9d the light\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbattery and sun relay system,\xe2\x80\x9d had failed \xe2\x80\x9cto make a proper examination\xe2\x80\x9d of outside \xe2\x80\x9cconnections,\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to check the light\xe2\x80\x9d on a regular basis, and had failed to \xe2\x80\x9crepair the light or give warning that the light was not operating.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Indian Towing</em>, 350 U. S., at 62.  These allegations, the Court held, were analogous to allegations of negligence by a private person \xe2\x80\x9cwho undertakes to warn the public of danger and thereby induces reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 64\xe2\x80\x9365.  It is \xe2\x80\x9chornbook tort law,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court added, that such a person \xe2\x80\x9cmust perform his \xe2\x80\x98good Samaritan\xe2\x80\x99 task in a careful manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government in effect concedes that similar \xe2\x80\x9cgood Samaritan\xe2\x80\x9d analogies exist for the conduct at issue here.  It says that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are private persons in \xe2\x80\x98like circumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to federal mine inspectors, namely \xe2\x80\x9cprivate persons who conduct safety inspections.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for United States 3.  And other Courts of Appeals have found ready private person analogies for Government tasks of this kind in FTCA cases.  E.g.</em>, <em>Dorking Genetics </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 76 F.\xc2\xa03d 1261 (CA2 1996) (inspection of cattle); <em>Florida Auto Auction of Orlando, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 74 F.\xc2\xa03d 498 (CA4 1996) (inspection of automobile titles); <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 49 F.\xc2\xa03d 607 (CA10 1995) (mine inspections); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 17 F.\xc2\xa03d 890 (CA6 1994) (same); <em>Howell </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 932 F.\xc2\xa02d 915 (CA11 1991) (inspection of airplanes).  These cases all properly apply the logic of <em>Indian Towing</em>.  Private individuals, who do not operate lighthouses, nonetheless may create a relationship with third parties that is similar to the relationship between a lighthouse operator and a ship dependent on the lighthouse\xe2\x80\x99s beacon.  <em>Indian Towing</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 64\xe2\x80\x9365, 69.  The Ninth Circuit should have looked for a similar analogy in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the Government\'s concession that a private person analogy exists in this case, the parties disagree about precisely which Arizona tort law doctrine applies here.
