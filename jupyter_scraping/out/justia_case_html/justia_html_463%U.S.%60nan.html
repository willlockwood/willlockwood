BRENNAN, J., took no part in the decision of the case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Title 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives.  The District Court held that, as applied to appellee\'s mailings, the statute violates the First Amendment.  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 3001(e)(2) states that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny unsolicited advertisement of matter which is designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception is nonmailable matter, shall not be carried or delivered by mail, and shall be disposed of as the Postal Service directs. . . . [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>As interpreted by Postal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 463 U. S. 62</a></p><p> Service regulations, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the statutory provision does not apply to unsolicited advertisements in which the mailer has no commercial interest.  In addition to the civil consequences of a violation of \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2), 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1461 makes it a crime knowingly to use the mails for anything declared by \xc2\xa7 3001(e) to be nonmailable. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellee Youngs Drug Products Corp. (Youngs) is engaged in the manufacture, sale, and distribution of contraceptives.  Youngs markets its products primarily through sales to chain warehouses and wholesale distributors, who in turn sell contraceptives to retail pharmacists, who then sell those products to individual customers.  Appellee publicizes the availability and desirability of its products by various methods.  This litigation resulted from Youngs\' decision to undertake a campaign of unsolicited mass mailings to members of the public.  In conjunction with its wholesalers and retailers, Youngs seeks to mail to the public on an unsolicited basis three types of materials:</p>\n<p>"-- multi-page, multi-item flyers promoting a large variety of products available at a drugstore, including prophylactics;"</p>\n<p>"-- flyers exclusively or substantially devoted to promoting prophylactics;"</p>\n<p>"-- informational pamphlets discussing the desirability and availability of prophylactics in general or Youngs\' products in particular. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 463 U. S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1979, the Postal Service traced to a wholesaler of Youngs\' products an allegation of an unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements.  The Service warned the wholesaler that the mailing violated 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2).  Subsequently, Youngs contacted the Service and furnished it with copies of Youngs\' three types of proposed mailings, stating its view that the statute could not constitutionally restrict the mailings.  The Service rejected Youngs\' legal argument and notified the company that the proposed mailings would violate \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2).  Youngs then brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  It claimed that the statute, as applied to its proposed mailings, violated the First Amendment, and that Youngs and its wholesaler were refraining from distributing the advertisements because of the Service\'s warning.</p>\n<p>The District Court determined that \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2), by its plain language, prohibited all three types of proposed mailings.  The court then addressed the constitutionality of the statute as applied to these mailings.  Finding all three types of materials to be commercial solicitations, the court considered the constitutionality of the statute within the framework established by this Court for analyzing restrictions imposed on commercial speech.  The court concluded that the statutory prohibition was more extensive than necessary to the interests asserted by the Government, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 463 U. S. 64</a></p><p> it therefore held that the statute\'s absolute ban on the three types of mailings violated the First Amendment. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Beginning with <em>Bigelow v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html">421 U. S. 809</a></span> (1975), this Court extended the protection of the First Amendment to commercial speech. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Nonetheless, our decisions have recognized</p>\n<p>"the \'common-sense\' distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech."</p>\n<p><em>Ohralik v.

Thus, we have held that the Constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 463 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>See Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\'n of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/case.html">447 U.

By contrast, regulation of commercial speech based on content is less problematic.  In light of the greater potential for deception or confusion in the context of certain advertising messages, <em>see In re R.M.J.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html">455 U. S. 191</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#200">455 U. S. 200</a></span> (1982), content-based restrictions on commercial speech may be permissible.  <em>See Friedman v. Rogers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/1/case.html">440 U. S. 1</a></span> (1979) (upholding prohibition on use of trade names by optometrists).</p>\n<p>Because the degree of protection afforded by the First Amendment depends on whether the activity sought to be regulated constitutes commercial or noncommercial speech, we must first determine the proper classification of the mailings at issue here.  Appellee contends that its proposed mailings constitute "fully protected" speech, so that \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) amounts to an impermissible content-based restriction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 463 U. S. 66</a></p><p> on such expression. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Appellants argue, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and the District Court held, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] that the proposed mailings are all commercial speech.  The application of \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) to appellee\'s proposed mailings must be examined carefully to ensure that speech deserving of greater constitutional protection is not inadvertently suppressed. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Most of appellee\'s mailings fall within the core notion of commercial speech -- "speech which does <em>no more than propose a commercial transaction.\'"  <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/748/case.html#762">425 U. S. 762</a></span>, quoting Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm\'n, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/376/case.html">413 U. S. 376</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/376/case.html#385">413 U. S. 385</a></span> (1973). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Youngs\' informational pamphlets, however, cannot be characterized merely as proposals to engage in commercial transactions.  Their proper classification as commercial or noncommercial speech thus presents a closer question.  The mere fact that these pamphlets are conceded to be advertisements clearly does not compel the conclusion that they are commercial speech.  <em>See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#265">376 U. S. 265</a></span>-266 (1964).  Similarly, the reference to a specific product does not, by itself, render the pamphlets commercial speech. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  <em>See Associated Students for Univ. of Cal. at Riverside v. Attorney General,</em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 463 U. S. 67</a></em></p><p><em> 368 F.Supp. 11, 24 (CD Cal.1973).  Finally, the fact that Youngs has an economic motivation for mailing the pamphlets would clearly be insufficient, by itself, to turn the materials into commercial speech.  <em>See Bigelow v. Virginia,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html#818">421 U. S. 818</a></span>; <em>Ginbzurg v.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/case.html">310 U. S. 88</a></span> (1940).\n</em></p>\n<p>The combination of all these characteristics, however, provides strong support for the District Court\'s conclusion that the informational pamphlets are properly characterized as commercial speech. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The mailings constitute commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 463 U. S. 68</a></p><p> of important public issues [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] such as venereal disease and family planning.  We have made clear that advertising which "links a product to a current public debate" is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech.  <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm\'n of New York,</em> 447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/case.html#563">447 U. S. 563</a></span>, n. 5.  A company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct comments on public issues, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] so there is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions.  <em>See ibid.</em>  Advertisers should not be permitted to immunize false or misleading product information from government regulation simply by including references to public issues.  <em>Cf. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/490/case.html">453 U. S. 490</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/490/case.html#540">453 U. S. 540</a></span> (1981) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that all of the mailings in this case are entitled to the qualified but nonetheless substantial protection accorded to commercial speech.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>"The protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation."</p>\n<p><em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm\'n of New York,</em> 447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/case.html#563">447 U. S. 563</a></span>.  In <em>Central Hudson,</em> we adopted a four-part analysis for assessing the validity of restrictions on commercial speech.  First, we determine whether the expression is constitutionally protected.  For commercial speech to receive such protection, "it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/case.html#566">447 U. S. 566</a></span>.  Second, we ask whether the governmental interest is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 463 U. S. 69</a></p><p> substantial.  If so, we must then determine whether the regulation directly advances the government interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Applying this analysis, we conclude that \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) is unconstitutional as applied to appellee\'s mailings.</p>\n<p>We turn first to the protection afforded by the First Amendment.  The State may deal effectively with false, deceptive, or misleading sales techniques.  <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,</em> 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/748/case.html#771">425 U. S. 771</a></span>-772.  The State may also prohibit commercial speech related to illegal behavior.  <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm\'n,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/376/case.html#388">413 U. S. 388</a></span>.  In this case, however, appellants have never claimed that Youngs\' proposed mailings fall into any of these categories.  To the contrary, advertising for contraceptives not only implicates "<em>substantial individual and societal interests\'" in the free flow of commercial information, but also relates to activity which is protected from unwarranted state interference.  <em>See Carey v. Population Services International,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html">431 U. S. 678</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#700">431 U.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Youngs\' proposed commercial speech is therefore clearly protected by the First Amendment. In deed, where -- as in this case -- a speaker desires to convey truthful information relevant to important social issues such as family planning and the prevention of venereal disease, we have previously found the First Amendment interest served by such speech paramount.  <em>See Carey v. Population Services International, supra; Bigelow v. Virginia, supra.</em> [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 463 U.

Act of Mar. 3, 1873, ch. 258, \xc2\xa7 2, 17 Stat. 599.

We have, of course, recognized the important interest in allowing addressees to give notice to a mailer that they wish no further mailings which, in their sole discretion, they believe to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative.  <em>See Rowan v.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  But we have never held that the Government itself can shut off the flow of mailings to protect those recipients who might potentially be offended.

As a means of effectuating this interest, however, \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) fails to withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p>To begin with, \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) provides only the most limited incremental support for the interest asserted.  We can reasonably assume that parents already exercise substantial control over the disposition of mail once it enters their mailboxes.  Under 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3008, parents can also exercise control over information that flows into their mailboxes.  And parents must already cope with the multitude of external stimuli that color their children\'s perception of sensitive subjects. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Under these circumstances, a ban on unsolicited advertisements serves only to assist those parents who desire to keep their children from confronting such mailings, who are otherwise unable to do so, and whose children have remained relatively free from such stimuli.</p>\n<p>This marginal degree of protection is achieved by purging all mailboxes of unsolicited material that is entirely suitable for adults.  We have previously made clear that a restriction of this scope is more extensive than the Constitution permits, for the government may not "reduce the adult population . . . to reading only what is fit for children."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/380/case.html">Butler v.

[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  At the same time, the majority "emphasize[d] the narrowness of our holding," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/case.html#750">438 U.

Our decisions have recognized that the special interest of the Federal Government in regulation of the broadcast media [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] does not readily translate into a justification for regulation of other means of communication.  <em>See Consolidated Edison Co. v.

In particular, an advertisement is not deemed unsolicited</p>\n<p>"if it is contained in a publication for which the addressee has paid or promised to pay a consideration or which he has otherwise indicated he desires to receive."</p>\n<p>In addition, the provision does not apply to advertisements mailed to certain recipients such as a manufacturer of contraceptives, a licensed physician, or a pharmacist.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2)(A) and (B).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Domestic Mail Manual \xc2\xa7 123.434 (July 7, 1981).

The first, entitled "Condoms and Human Sexuality," is a 12-page pamphlet describing the use, manufacture, desirability, and availability of condoms, and providing detailed descriptions of various Trojan-brand condoms manufactured by Youngs.  The second, entitled "Plain Talk about Venereal Disease," is an eight-page pamphlet discussing at length the problem of venereal disease and the use and advantages of condoms in aiding the prevention of venereal disease.  The only identification of Youngs or its products is at the bottom of the last page of the pamphlet, which states that the pamphlet has been contributed as a public service by Youngs, the distributor of Trojan-brand prophylactics.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court ordered that the multi-item drugstore flyers containing promotion of contraceptives could be mailed to the same extent such flyers could be mailed if they did not contain such promotion.  With respect to flyers and pamphlets devoted to promoting the desirability or availability of contraceptives, the court\'s order states that such materials were mailable only under four conditions:</p>\n<p>"First, they must be mailed in an envelope that completely obscures from the sight of the addressee the contents.  Second, the envelope must contain a prominent notice stating in capital letters that the enclosed material has not been solicited in any way by the recipient.  Third, the envelope must contain a prominent warning that the contents are \'promotional material for contraceptive products.\'  Fourth, the envelope must contain a notice, in less prominent lettering than the warning and the other notice, but not in \'fine print,\' that federal law permits the recipient to have his name removed from the mailing list of the mailer of that envelope, and citing to 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3008(a)."</p>\n<p>526 F.Supp. 823, 830 (1981).</p>\n<p>Youngs did not file a cross-appeal challenging these restrictions, and their propriety is therefore not before us in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Before that time, purely commercial advertising received no First Amendment protection.  <em>See Valentine v.

To the extent any of appellee\'s mailings could be considered noncommercial speech, our conclusion that \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) is unconstitutional as applied would be reinforced.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, the drugstore flyer consists primarily of price and quantity information.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>One of the informational pamphlets, "Condoms and Human Sexuality," specifically refers to a number of Trojan-brand condoms manufactured by appellee and describes the advantages of each type.</p>\n<p>The other informational pamphlet, "Plain Talk about Venereal Disease," repeatedly discusses condoms without any specific reference to those manufactured by appellee.  The only reference to appellee\'s products is contained at the very bottom of the last page, where appellee is identified as the distributor of Trojan-brand prophylactics.  That a product is referred to generically does not, however, remove it from the realm of commercial speech.  For example, a company with sufficient control of the market for a product may be able to promote the product without reference to its own brand names.  Or a trade association may make statements about a product without reference to specific brand names.  <em>See, e.g., National Comm\'n on Egg Nutrition v. FTC,</em> 570 F.2d 157 (CA7 1977) (enforcing in part a Federal Trade Commission order prohibiting false and misleading advertising by an egg industry trade association concerning the relationship between cholesterol, eggs, and heart disease).  In this case, Youngs describes itself as "the leader in the manufacture and sale" of contraceptives.

Of course, a different conclusion may be appropriate in a case where the pamphlet advertises an activity itself protected by the First Amendment.  <em>See Murdock v.

But because the home mailbox has features which distinguish it from a public hall or public park, where it may be assumed that all who are present wish to hear the views of the particular speaker then on the rostrum, it cannot be totally assimilated for purposes of analysis with these traditional public forums.  Several people within a family or living group may have free access to a mailbox, including minor children; and obviously not every piece of mail received has been either expressly or impliedly solicited.  It is the unsolicited mass mailings sent by appellee designed to promote the use of condoms that gives rise to this litigation.</p>\n<p>Our earlier cases have developed an analytic framework for commercial speech cases.</p>\n<p>"At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment.  For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.

The Government may properly act to protect people from unreasonable intrusions into their homes.</p>\n<p>The questions whether \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) directly advances these interests, and whether it is more extensive than necessary, are more problematic.  Under 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3008, an individual can have his name removed from Youngs\' mailing list if he so wishes.  <em>See Rowan v. Post Office Dept., supra,</em> (holding \xc2\xa7 3008 constitutional).  Thus, individuals are able to avoid the information in Youngs\' advertisements after one exposure.

Although this restriction directly advances weighty governmental interests, it is somewhat more extensive than is necessary to serve those interests.  On balance, I conclude that this restriction on Youngs\' commercial speech [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] has not been adequately justified.  Section 3001(e)(2) therefore violates the First Amendment as applied to Youngs and to material of the type Youngs has indicated that it plans to send, and I agree that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Postal Service acknowledges that these justifications were not the reasons why \xc2\xa7 3001(e)(2) was originally enacted.

Public Service Comm\'n of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/case.html">447 U. S. 557</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/case.html#579">447 U. S. 579</a></span> (1980) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>I agree, of course, that the commercial aspects of a message may provide a justification for regulation that is not present when the communication has no commercial character.  The interest in protecting consumers from commercial harm justifies a requirement that advertising be truthful; no such interest applies to fairy tales or soap operas.  But advertisements may be complex mixtures of commercial and noncommercial elements:  the noncommercial message does not obviate the need for appropriate commercial regulation (<em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/case.html#68">463 U. S. 68</a></span>); conversely, the commercial element does not necessarily provide a valid basis for noncommercial censorship.</p>\n<p>Appellee\'s pamphlet entitled "Plain Talk about Venereal Disease" highlights the classification problem.  On the one hand, the pamphlet includes statements that implicitly extol the quality of the appellee\'s products. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  A law that protects </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 463 U. S. 82</a></p><p> the public from suffering commercial harm as a result of such statements would appropriately be evaluated as a regulation of commercial speech.  On the other hand, most of the pamphlet is devoted to a discussion of the symptoms, significant risks, and possibility of treatment for venereal disease. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] That discussion does not appear to endanger any commercial interest whatsoever; it serves only to inform the public about a medical issue of regrettably great significance.</p>\n<p>I have not yet been persuaded that the commercial motivation of an author is sufficient to alter the state\'s power to regulate speech.  Anthony Comstock surely had a constitutional right to speak out against the use of contraceptives in his day.  Like Comstock, many persons today are morally opposed to contraception, and the First Amendment commands the government to allow them to express their views in appropriate ways and in appropriate places.  I believe that Amendment affords the same protection to this appellee\'s views regarding the hygienic and family planning advantages of its contraceptive products.</p>\n<p>Because significant speech so often comprises both commercial and noncommercial elements, it may be more fruitful to focus on the nature of the challenged regulation, rather </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 463 U. S. 83</a></p><p> than the proper label for the communication.  <em>Cf.</em> Farber, Commercial Speech and First Amendment Theory, 74 NW.U.L.Rev. 372, 386-390 (1979).  The statute at issue in this case prohibits the mailing of "[a]ny unsolicited advertisement of matter which is designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception."  Any legitimate interests the statute may serve are unrelated to the prevention of harm to participants in commercial exchanges. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Thus, because it restricts speech by the appellee that has a significant noncommercial component, I have scrutinized this statute in the same manner as I would scrutinize a prohibition on unsolicited mailings by an organization with absolutely no commercial interest in the subject.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Assuming that this case deals only with commercial speech, the Court implies, if it does not actually hold, that the fact that protected speech may be offensive to some persons is not a "sufficient justification for a prohibition of commercial speech."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/case.html#72">463 U. S. 72</a></span>.  I think it essential to emphasize once again, however, that</p>\n<p>"a communication may be offensive in two different ways.  Independently of the message the speaker intends to convey, the form of his communication may be offensive -- perhaps because it is too loud or too ugly in a particular setting.  Other speeches, even though elegantly phrased in dulcet tones, are offensive simply because the listener disagrees with the speaker\'s message."</p>\n<p><em>Consolidated Edison Co. v.

Governmental suppression of a specific point of view strikes at the core of First Amendment values. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  In contrast, regulations of form and context may strike a constitutionally appropriate balance between the advocate\'s right to convey a message and the recipient\'s interest in the quality of his environment:</p>\n<p>"he fact that the advertising of a particular subject matter is <em>sometimes</em> offensive does not deprive all such advertising of First Amendment protection; but it is equally clear to me that the existence of such protection does not deprive the State of all power to regulate such advertising in order to minimize its offensiveness.

It prohibits appellee from mailing any unsolicited advertisement of contraceptives, no matter how unobtrusive and tactful; yet it permits anyone to mail unsolicited advertisements of devices intended to facilitate conception, no matter how coarse or grotesque.  It thus excludes one advocate from a forum to which adversaries have unlimited access.  I concur in the Court\'s judgment that the First Amendment prohibits the application of the statute to these materials.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The pamphlet states that it was contributed by the appellee as a public service, identifying the brand name of appellee\'s products.

This sore is called a Chancre (pronounced shank-er).  It appears between two to six weeks after exposure to the infected person.  This Chancre or sore will disappear even without treatment, but this only means that the disease has gone deeper into the body.  <em>The disease is not cured.</em>  The secondary stage of Syphilis, which begins two to six months after the Chancre, can include skin rashes over all or part of the body, baldness, sore throat, fever and headaches.  Even these will disappear without treatment, <em>but the disease is still in the body</em> . . . just waiting to create such \'final\' problems as crippling the nervous system, syphilitic insanity, heart disease and death."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 28.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the right to decide whether to bear or beget a child is constitutionally protected, a government may not justify inhibiting access to contraceptives by claiming that, by their very nature, they harm consumers.  <em>See Carey v.
