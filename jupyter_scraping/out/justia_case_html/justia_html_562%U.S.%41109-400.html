PROCTOR HOSPITAL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">STAUB <em>v</em>. PROCTOR HOSPITAL</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93400.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 2, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 1, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">While employed as an angiography technician by respondent Proctor Hospital, petitioner Staub was a member of the United States Army Reserve.  Both his immediate supervisor (Mulally) and Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor (Korenchuk) were hostile to his military obligations.  Mulally gave Staub disciplinary warning which included a directive requiring Staub to report to her or Korenchuk when his cases were completed.  After receiving a report from Korenchuk that Staub had violated the Corrective Action, Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of human resources (Buck) reviewed Staub\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file and decided to fire him.  Staub filed a grievance, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his military obligations, but Buck adhered to her decision.  Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which forbids an employer to deny \xe2\x80\x9cemployment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment\xe2\x80\x9d based on a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmembership\xe2\x80\x9d in or \xe2\x80\x9cobligation to perform service in a uniformed service,\xe2\x80\x9d 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74311(a), and provides that liability is established \xe2\x80\x9cif the person\xe2\x80\x99s membership \xe2\x80\xa6 is a motivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74311(c).  He contended not that Buck was motivated by hostility to his military obligations, but that Mulally and Korenchuk were, and that their actions influenced Buck\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  A jury found Proctor liable and awarded Staub damages, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s and Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s advice in making her decision.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.  In construing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court starts from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.  See, <em>e.g., Burlington N. &amp; S. F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Intentional torts such as the one here \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally require that the actor intend \xe2\x80\x98the consequences\xe2\x80\x99 of an act,\xe2\x80\x99 not simply \xe2\x80\x98the act itself.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kawaauhau</em> v. <em>Geiger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/57/index.html">523 U. S. 57</a>, 61\xe2\x80\x9362.  However, Proctor errs in contending that an employer is not liable unless the <em>de facto</em> decisionmaker is motivated by discriminatory animus.  So long as the earlier agent intended, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required for USERRA liability.  Moreover, it is axiomatic under tort law that the decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of judgment does not prevent the earlier agent\xe2\x80\x99s action from being the proximate cause of the harm.  See <em>Hemi Group, LLC</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/559/1/index.html">559 U. S. 1</a>, ___.  Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm.  See <em>Exxon Co., U. S. A.</em> v. <em>Sofec, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/830/index.html">517 U. S. 830</a>, 837.  Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s approach would have an improbable consequence: If an employer isolates a personnel official from its supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce the adverse action.  Proctor also errs in arguing that a decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s independent investigation, and rejection, of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the prior discrimination.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Applying this analysis here, the Seventh Circuit erred in holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Both Mulally and Korenchuk acted within the scope of their employment when they took the actions that allegedly caused Buck to fire Staub.  There was also evidence that their actions were motivated by hostility toward Staub\xe2\x80\x99s military obligations, and that those actions were causal factors underlying Buck\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Finally, there was evidence that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to cause Staub\xe2\x80\x99s termination.  The Seventh Circuit is to consider in the first instance whether the variance between the jury instruction given at trial and the rule adopted here was harmless error or should mandate a new trial.

Staub and Proctor hotly dispute the facts surrounding the firing, but because a jury found for Staub in his claim of employment discrimination against Proctor, we describe the facts viewed in the light most favorable to him.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While employed by Proctor, Staub was a member of the United States Army Reserve, which required him to attend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for two to three weeks a year.  Both Janice Mulally, Staub\xe2\x80\x99s immediate supervisor, and Michael Korenchuk, Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor, were hostile to Staub\xe2\x80\x99s military obligations.  Mulally scheduled Staub for additional shifts without notice so that he would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pa[y] back the department for everyone else having to bend over backwards to cover [his] schedule for the Reserves.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  560 F.\xc2\xa03d 647, 652 (CA7 2009).  She also informed Staub\xe2\x80\x99s co-worker, Leslie Sweborg, that Staub\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98military duty had been a strain on th[e] department,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and asked Sweborg to help her \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98get rid of him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Korenchuk referred to Staub\xe2\x80\x99s military obligations as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a b[u]nch of smoking and joking and [a] waste of taxpayers[\xe2\x80\x99] money.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  He was also aware that Mulally was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98out to get\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Staub.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a \xe2\x80\x9cCorrective Action\xe2\x80\x9d disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a company rule requiring him to stay in his work area whenever he was not working with a patient.  The Corrective Action included a directive requiring Staub to report to Mulally or Korenchuk \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when [he] ha[d] no patients and [the angio] cases [we]re complete[d].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 653.  According to Staub, Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s justification for the Corrective Action was false for two reasons: First, the company rule invoked by Mulally did not exist; and second, even if it did, Staub did not violate it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 2, 2004, Angie Day, Staub\xe2\x80\x99s co-worker, complained to Linda Buck, Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of human resources, and Garrett McGowan, Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s chief operating officer, about Staub\xe2\x80\x99s frequent unavailability and abruptness.  McGowan directed Korenchuk and Buck to create a plan that would solve Staub\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98availability\xe2\x80\x99 problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 654.  But three weeks later, before they had time to do so, Korenchuk informed Buck that Staub had left his desk without informing a supervisor, in violation of the January Corrective Action.  Staub now contends this accusation was false: he had left Korenchuk a voice-mail notification that he was leaving his desk.  Buck relied on Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s accusation, however, and after reviewing Staub\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file, she decided to fire him.  The termination notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive issued in the January 2004 Corrective Action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Staub challenged his firing through Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process, claiming that Mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the Corrective Action out of hostility toward his military obligations.  Buck did not follow\nup with Mulally about this claim.  After discussing the matter with another personnel officer, Buck adhered to her decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74301 <em>et seq.,</em> claiming that his discharge was motivated by hostility to his obligations as a military reservist.  His contention was not that Buck had any such hostility but that Mulally and Korenchuk did, and that their actions influenced Buck\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate employment decision.  A jury found that Staub\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary status was a motivating factor in [Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s] decision to discharge him,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 68a, and awarded $57,640 in damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  560 F.\xc2\xa03d 647.  The court observed that Staub had brought a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cat\xe2\x80\x99s paw\xe2\x80\x99 case,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable for the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with making the ultimate employment decision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 655\xe2\x80\x93656.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It explained that under Seventh Circuit precedent, a \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x99s paw\xe2\x80\x9d case could not succeed unless the nondecisionmaker exercised such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98singular influence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d over the decisionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product of \xe2\x80\x9cblind reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 659.  It then noted that \xe2\x80\x9cBuck looked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said,\xe2\x80\x9d relying in part on her conversation with Day and her review of Staub\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court \xe2\x80\x9cadmit[ted] that Buck\xe2\x80\x99s investigation could have been more robust,\xe2\x80\x9d since it \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to pursue Staub\xe2\x80\x99s theory that Mulally fabricated the write-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But the court said that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98singular influence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require the decisionmaker to be a paragon of independence\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough that the decisionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single source of information and conducts her own investigation into the facts relevant to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the undisputed evidence established that Buck was not wholly dependent on the advice of Korenchuk and Mulally, the court held that Proctor was entitled to judgment.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  559 U.

The problem we confront arises when that official has no discriminatory animus but is influenced by previous company action that is the product of a like animus in someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In approaching this question, we start from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.  See <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/47/index.html">551 U.

S. 742</a>, 764 (1998).  Intentional torts such as this, \xe2\x80\x9cas distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, \xe2\x80\xa6 generally require that the actor intend \xe2\x80\x98the <em>consequences</em>\xe2\x80\x99 of an act,\xe2\x80\x99 not simply \xe2\x80\x98the act itself.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kawaauhau</em> v. <em>Geiger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/57/index.html">523 U. S. 57</a>, 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s personnel record was caused to be put there, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Korenchuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and Korenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal.  But discrimination was no part of Buck\xe2\x80\x99s reason for the dismissal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with discriminatory animus, the act they committed\xe2\x80\x94the mere making of the reports\xe2\x80\x94was not a denial of \xe2\x80\x9cinitial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment,\xe2\x80\x9d as liability under USERRA requires.  If dismissal was not the object of Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s and Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s reports, it may have been\ntheir result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but that is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk\nresponsible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mulally and Korenchuk, but their employer.  Perhaps, therefore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s agents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the act of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor.  Again we consult general principles of law, agency law, which form the background against which federal tort laws are enacted.  See <em>Meyer</em> v. <em>Holley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/280/index.html">537 U. S. 280</a>, 285 (2003); <em>Burlington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 754\xe2\x80\x93755.  Here, however, the answer is not so clear.  The Restatement of Agency suggests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot generally be combined with the harmful action of another agent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires both.  See Restatement (Second) Agency \xc2\xa7275, Illustration 4 (1958).  Some of the cases involving federal torts apply that rule.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Science Applications Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em>, 626 F.\xc2\xa03d 1257, 1273\xe2\x80\x931276 (CADC 2010); <em>Chaney</em> v. <em>Dreyfus Service Corp.</em>, 595 F.\xc2\xa03d 219, 241 (CA5 2010); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Philip Morris USA Inc.</em>, 566 F.\xc2\xa03d 1095, 1122 (CADC 2009).  But another case involving a federal tort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the contrary.  See <em>United States ex rel. Harrison</em> v. <em>Westinghouse Savannah River Co.</em>, 352 F.\xc2\xa03d 908, 918\xe2\x80\x93919 (CA4 2003); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bank of New England, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, 821 F.\xc2\xa02d 844, 856 (CA1 1987).  Ultimately, we think it unnecessary in this case to decide what the background rule of agency law may be, since the former line of authority is suggested by the governing text, which requires that discrimination be \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d <em>in the adverse action</em>.  When a decision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the part of the firing agent, but partly on the basis of a report prompted (unbeknownst to that agent) by discrimination, discrimination might perhaps be called a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccausal factor\xe2\x80\x9d in the decision; but it seems to us a considerable stretch to call it \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proctor, on the other hand, contends that the employer is not liable unless the <em>de facto </em>decisionmaker (the technical decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x99s paw\xe2\x80\x9d) is motivated by discriminatory animus.  This avoids the aggregation of animus and adverse action, but it seems to us not the only application of general tort law that can do so.  Animus and responsibility for the adverse action can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here, Staub\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct.  So long as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be liable under USERRA.  And it is axiomatic under tort law that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does not prevent the earlier agent\xe2\x80\x99s action (and hence the earlier agent\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory animus) from being the proximate cause of the harm.  Proximate cause requires only \xe2\x80\x9csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\xe2\x80\x9d and excludes only those \xe2\x80\x9clink[s] that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hemi Group, LLC</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/559/1/index.html">559 U. S. 1</a>, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We do not think that the ultimate decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of judgment automatically renders the link to the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s bias \xe2\x80\x9cremote\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpurely contingent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of judgment is <em>also </em>a proximate cause of the employment decision, but it is common for injuries to have multiple proximate causes.  See <em>Sosa</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/692/index.html">542 U. S. 692</a>, 704 (2004).  Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm.  A cause can be thought \xe2\x80\x9csuperseding\xe2\x80\x9d only if it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccause of independent origin that was not foreseeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Co., U. S. A.</em> v. <em>Sofec, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/830/index.html">517 U. S. 830</a>, 837 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives an unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent employer discrimination.  An employer\xe2\x80\x99s authority to reward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multiple agents.  The one who makes the ultimate decision does so on the basis of performance assessments by other supervisors.  Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s view would have the improbable consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel official from an employee\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee\xe2\x80\x99s personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were <em>designed and intended</em> to produce the adverse action.  That seems to us an implausible meaning of the text, and one that is not compelled by its words.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s mere exercise of independent judgment does not suffice to negate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s independent investigation (and rejection) of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of discriminatory animus ought to do so.   We decline to adopt such a hard-and-fast rule.  As we have already acknowledged, the requirement that the biased supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s action be a causal factor of the ultimate employment action incorporates the traditional tort-law concept of proximate cause.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Anza</em> v. <em>Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/451/index.html">547 U. S. 451</a>, 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (2006); <em>Sosa</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 703.  Thus, if the employer\xe2\x80\x99s investigation results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s original biased action (by the terms of USERRA it is the employer\xe2\x80\x99s burden to establish that), then the employer will not be liable.  But the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s biased report may remain a causal factor if the independent investigation takes it into account without determining that the adverse action was, apart from the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, entirely justified.  We are aware of no principle in tort or agency law under which an employer\xe2\x80\x99s mere conduct of an independent investigation has a claim-preclusive effect.  Nor do we think the independent investigation somehow relieves the employer of \xe2\x80\x9cfault.\xe2\x80\x9d  The employer is at fault because one of its agents committed an action based on discriminatory animus that was intended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse employment decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito claims that our failure to adopt a rule immunizing an employer who performs an independent investigation reflects a \xe2\x80\x9cstray[ing] from the statutory text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment).  We do not understand this accusation.  Since a supervisor is an agent of the employer, when he causes an adverse employment action the employer causes it; and when discrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action,\xe2\x80\x9d precisely as the text requires.  Justice Alito suggests that the employer should be held liable only when it \xe2\x80\x9cshould be regarded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking power\xe2\x80\x9d to the biased supervisor.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But if the independent investigation relies on facts provided by the biased supervisor\xe2\x80\x94as is necessary in any case of cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw liability\xe2\x80\x94then the employer (either directly or through\nthe ultimate decisionmaker) will have effectively delegated the factfinding portion of the investigation to the biased supervisor.  Contrary to Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the biased supervisor is not analogous to a witness at a bench trial.  The mere witness is not an actor in the events that are the subject of the trial.  The biased supervisor and the ultimate decisionmaker, however, acted as agents of the entity that the plaintiff seeks to hold liable; each of them possessed supervisory authority delegated by their employer and exercised it in the interest of their employer.  In sum, we do not see how \xe2\x80\x9cfidelity to the statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, requires the adoption of an independent-investigation defense that appears nowhere in the text.  And we find both speculative and implausible Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s employers will systematically disfavor members of the armed services in their hiring decisions to avoid the possibility of cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw liability, a policy that would violate USERRA in any event.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is <em>intended</em> by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying our analysis to the facts of this case, it is clear that the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment must be reversed.  Both Mulally and Korenchuk were acting within the scope of their employment when they took the actions that allegedly caused Buck to fire Staub.  A \xe2\x80\x9creprimand \xe2\x80\xa6 for workplace failings\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes conduct within the scope of an agent\xe2\x80\x99s employment.  <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a>, 798\xe2\x80\x93799 (1998).  As the Seventh Circuit recognized, there was evidence that Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s and Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s actions were motivated by hostility toward Staub\xe2\x80\x99s military obligations.  There was also evidence that Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s and Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s actions were causal factors underlying Buck\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire Staub.  Buck\xe2\x80\x99s termination notice expressly stated that Staub was terminated because he had \xe2\x80\x9cignored\xe2\x80\x9d the directive in the Corrective Action.  Finally, there was evidence that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to cause Staub to be terminated.  Mulally stated she was trying to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98get rid of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Staub, and Korenchuk was aware that Mulally was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98out to get\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Staub.  Moreover, Korenchuk informed Buck, Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s personnel officer responsible for terminating employees, of Staub\xe2\x80\x99s alleged noncompliance with Mulally\xe2\x80\x99s Corrective Action, and Buck fired Staub immediately thereafter; a reasonable jury could infer that Korenchuk intended that Staub be fired.  The Seventh Circuit therefore erred in holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is less clear whether the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict should be reinstated or whether Proctor is entitled to a new trial.  The jury instruction did not hew precisely to the rule we adopt today; it required only that the jury find that \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary status was a motivating factor in [Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s] decision to discharge him.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 68a.  Whether the variance between the instruction and our rule was harmless error or should mandate a new trial is a matter the Seventh Circuit may consider in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice</em> Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x99s paw\xe2\x80\x9d derives from a fable conceived by Aesop, put into verse by La Fontaine in 1679, and injected into United States employment discrimination law by Posner in 1990.  See <em>Shager</em> v. <em>Upjohn Co.</em>, 913 F.\xc2\xa02d 398, 405 (CA7).  In the fable, a monkey induces a cat by flattery to extract roasting chestnuts from the fire.  After the cat has done so, burning its paws in the process, the monkey makes off with the chestnuts and leaves the cat with nothing.  A coda to the fable (relevant only marginally, if at all, to employment law) observes that the cat is similar to princes who, flattered by the king, perform services on the king\xe2\x80\x99s behalf and receive no reward.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under the traditional doctrine of proximate cause, a tortfeasor is sometimes, but not always, liable when he intends to cause an adverse action and a different adverse action results.

We express no view as to whether the employer would be liable if a co-worker, rather than a supervisor, committed a discriminatory act that influenced the ultimate employment decision.  We also observe that Staub took advantage of Proctor\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process, and we express no view as to whether Proctor would have an affirmative defense if he did not.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74311(c)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For present purposes, the key phrase is \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d is a factor that \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] \xe2\x80\xa6 a motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1475 (1971) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmotivate\xe2\x80\x9d).  A \xe2\x80\x9cmotive,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, is \xe2\x80\x9csomething within a person \xe2\x80\xa6 that incites him to action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Thus, in order for discrimination to be \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor in [an] employer\xe2\x80\x99s action,\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination must be present \xe2\x80\x9cwithin,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, in the mind of, the person who makes the decision to take that action.  And \xe2\x80\x9cthe employer\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x9d here is the decision to fire petitioner.  Thus, petitioner, in order to recover, was required to show that discrimination motivated <em>that</em> action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, strays from the statutory text by holding that it is enough for an employee to show that discrimination motivated <em>some other action </em>and that this latter action, in turn, caused the termination decision.  That is simply not what the statute says.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court fears this interpretation of the statute would allow an employer to escape liability by assigning formal decisionmaking authority to an officer who may merely rubberstamp the recommendation of others who are motivated by antimilitary animus.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8.  But fidelity to the statutory text does not lead to this result.  Where the officer with formal decisionmaking authority merely rubberstamps the recommendation of others, the employer, I would hold, has actually delegated the decisionmaking responsibility to those whose recommendation is rubberstamped.  I would reach a similar conclusion where the officer with the formal decisionmaking authority is put on notice that adverse information about an employee may be based on antimilitary animus but does not undertake an independent investigation of the matter.  In that situation, too, the employer should be regarded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking power to those who are responsible for memorializing and transmitting the adverse information that is accepted without examination.  The same cannot be said, however, where the officer with formal decisionmaking responsibility, having been alerted to the possibility that adverse information may be tainted, undertakes a reasonable investigation and finds insufficient evidence to dispute the accuracy of that information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nor can the employer be said to have \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively delegated\xe2\x80\x9d decisionmaking authority any time a decisionmaker \xe2\x80\x9crelies on facts provided by [a] biased supervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  A decisionmaker who credits information provided by another person\xe2\x80\x94for example, a judge who credits the testimony of a witness in a bench trial\xe2\x80\x94does not thereby delegate a portion of the decisionmaking authority to the person who provides the information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation of \xc2\xa74311(c)(1) heeds the statutory text and would provide fair treatment for both employers and employees who are members of the uniformed services.  It would also encourage employers to establish internal grievance procedures similar to those that have been adopted following our decisions in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a> (1998), and <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a> (1998).  Such procedures would often provide relief for employees without the need for litigation, and they would provide protection for employers who proceed in good faith.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary approach, by contrast, is almost certain to lead to confusion and is likely to produce results that will not serve the interests of either employers or employees who are members of the uniformed services.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will impose liability unfairly on employers who make every effort to comply with the law, and it may have the perverse effect of discouraging employers from hiring applicants who are members of the Reserves or the National Guard.  In addition, by leaving open the possibility that an employer may be held liable if it innocently takes into account adverse information provided, not by a supervisor, but by a low-level employee, see <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, n.\xc2\xa04, the Court increases the confusion that its decision is likely to produce.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I cannot accept the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa74311(c)(1), but I nevertheless agree that the decision below must be reversed.  There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that at least Korenchuk was actually delegated part of the decisionmaking authority in this case.  Korenchuk was the head of the unit in which Staub worked and it was Korenchuk who told Buck that Staub left his work area without informing his supervisors.  There was evidence that Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s accusation formed the basis of Buck\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire Staub, and that Buck simply accepted the accusation at face value.  According to one version of events, Buck fired Staub immediately after Korenchuk informed her of Staub\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct, and she cited only that misconduct in the termination notice provided to Staub.  See 5 Record 128\xe2\x80\x93129, 267\xe2\x80\x93268, 380\xe2\x80\x93386; App. 74a.  All of this is enough to show that Korenchuk was in effect delegated some of Buck\xe2\x80\x99s termination authority.  There was also evidence from which it may be inferred that displeasure with Staub\xe2\x80\x99s Reserve responsibilities was a motivating factor in Korenchuk\xe2\x80\x99s actions.<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See 5 Record 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (testimony that Korenchuk made negative remarks about Staub\xe2\x80\x99s Reserve duties before firing him in 1998); <em>id.</em>, at 124\xe2\x80\x93126, 352 (testimony that Korenchuk informed Staub of the revenue lost while he was on Active Duty in 2003, that Korenchuk was aware in January 2004 that Staub might be called to Active Duty again, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]udget was a big issue with [Korenchuk]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
