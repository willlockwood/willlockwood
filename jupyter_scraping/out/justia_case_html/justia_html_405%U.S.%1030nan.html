Code. Section 23(a) of the Act provides that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, or any court decisions ... to the contrary, the Secretary of Transportation and the government of the District of Columbia shall ... construct" certain specified "routes on the Interstate System within the District of Columbia ." (Emphasis added.) In 23(b), Congress singled out four particular projects, including this one, for special treatment by providing that work on those projects was to commend "[n]ot later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this section." In an earlier phase of the litigation involved in the instant petition, the Court of Appeals rejected the petitioners\' contention that 23 rendered inapplicable the pre- construction planning and public hearing requirements set out in various sections of Title 23 of the United States Code.

On remand following that decision, the District Court found that the petitioners had complied with all applicable provisions of Title 23 except those of 128 relating to public hearings and those of 109 relating to safety standards and other requirements. The Court of Appeals, in the decision that we are now being asked to review, reversed in part, holding that the petitioners had failed to comply with a number of additional pre- construction provisions of Title 23. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1949569">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> VOLPE, SEC.
