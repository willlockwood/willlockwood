It is there provided that the citation must be signed by the chief justice or judge or chancellor of the court rendering or passing the judgment or decree complained of or by a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  But the citation in the case before us was signed by a district judge.  This was without authority of law, and the citation was therefore without effect.
