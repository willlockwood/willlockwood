JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The People of Puerto Rico, the petitioner, brought this suit in the Insular District Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, against the respondent Russell &amp; Co., a <em>sociedad en comandita</em> organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, to recover certain assessments levied on lands of Russell &amp; Co., under an act of the Legislature of Puerto Rico.  The individual respondents, members of the <em>sociedad,</em> none of whom are citizens of Puerto Rico or domiciled there, were not named as defendants.  They appeared specially in the Insular Court and removed the cause to the United States District Court for Puerto Rico.  That court denied a motion to remand and gave its decree for respondents on the ground, first raised by the answer, that the assessments </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 288 U. S. 478</a></p><p> sued for were levied in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Organic Act of Porto Rico, March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951, forbidding the enactment of any law impairing the obligation of contract.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, 60 F.2d 10; this Court granted certiorari. 287 U.S. 593.</p>\n<p>Section 41 of the Organic Act confers on the United States District Court for Puerto Rico "jurisdiction of all cases cognizable in the district courts of the United States," and also</p>\n<p>"jurisdiction of all controversies where all of the parties on either side of the controversy are citizens . . . of a foreign State or States, or citizens of a State, Territory, or District of the United States not domiciled in Porto Rico, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or cost, the sum or value of $3,000."</p>\n<p>By \xc2\xa7 42,</p>\n<p>"the laws of the United States relating to . . . removal of causes, and other matters or proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the several States shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the district court of the United States and the courts of Porto Rico. . . ."</p>\n<p>Thus, suits arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States are within the jurisdiction of the District Court for Puerto Rico (\xc2\xa7 24, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 41), and civil suits begun in the Insular Court over which the federal court has original jurisdiction may be removed in accordance with the provisions of \xc2\xa7 28 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 71).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, if the individual members of the <em>sociedad</em> are "parties" within the meaning of the Organic Act, \xc2\xa7 41, <em>supra,</em> the suit is one within the jurisdiction of the District Court because of their nonresidence, diversity of citizenship being unnecessary.  <em>See Porto Rico Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. v. Mor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/345/case.html">253 U. S. 345</a></span>.  And, if the nonresidence of the individual members would confer jurisdiction upon the federal court in a suit against the <em>sociedad</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 288 U. S. 479</a></p><p> originally instituted there, we will assume, for present purposes, that it would also suffice to justify removal by the individuals, even though the Insular Court refuses to recognize them as parties.  <em>Compare McLaughlin v. Hallowell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/278/case.html">228 U. S. 278</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/278/case.html#290">228 U. S. 290</a></span>.  The petitioner argues, nevertheless, that the suit was not removable because of citizenship, for the reason that the <em>sociedad</em> is a juridical entity under Puerto Rican law and, as in the case of a corporation, its domicile, rather than that of its members, determines citizenship for purposes of federal jurisdiction.  If the petitioner\'s contention is sound, the District Court was without jurisdiction unless the suit was, as the respondents argue, one arising under the laws of the United States.  The questions raised by these contentions must therefore first be answered.</p>\n<p>For almost a century, in ascertaining whether there is the requisite diversity of citizenship to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts, we have looked to the domicile of a corporation, not that of its individual stockholders, as controlling.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html">Louisville R. Co. v. Letson,</a></span></em> 2 How. 497; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/55/80/case.html">Rundle v.

In its final form, this rule of jurisdiction was stated in terms of a "conclusive presumption" that the stockholders are citizens of the state of the corporate domicile, <em>see Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R., supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>; <em>Covington Draw Bridge Co. v.

James, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html#554">161 U. S. 554</a></span>; but even those who formulated the rule found its theoretical justification only in the complete legal personality with which corporations are endowed.  Fictitious that personality may be, in the sense that the fact that the corporation is composed of a plurality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 288 U. S. 480</a></p><p> of individuals, themselves legal persons, is disregarded, but "it is a fiction created by law with intent that it should be acted on as if true."  <em>Klein v.

This treatment of the aggregate for other purposes as a person distinct from its members, with capacity to perform all legal acts, made it possible and convenient to treat it so for purposes of federal jurisdiction as well.  But status as a unit for purposes of suit alone, as in the case of a joint stock company, <em>see Chapman v. Barney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/129/677/case.html">129 U.

Board of Trustees,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/195/207/case.html">195 U. S. 207</a></span>, has been deemed a legal personality too incomplete; what was but an association of individuals for so many ends and a juridical entity for only a few was not easily to be treated as if it were a single citizen.</p>\n<p>The tradition of the common law is to treat as legal persons only incorporated groups, and to assimilate all others to partnerships.  <em>Chapman v. Barney, supra; Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. v. Jones, supra.</em>  The tradition of the civil law, as expressed in the Code of Puerto Rico, is otherwise. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/476/case.html">*</a></span>  Therefore, to call the <em>sociedad en</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 288 U. S. 481</a></p><p> <em>comandita</em> a limited partnership in the common law sense, as the respondents and others have done, is to invoke a false analogy.  In the law of its creation, the <em>sociedad</em> is consistently regarded as a juridical person.  It may contract, own property, and transact business, sue and be sued in its own name and right.  Civil Code (1930), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 27 to 30; Code of Commerce (1930), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 95, 97, 123, 124.  Its members are not thought to have a sufficient personal interest in a suit brought against the entity to entitle them to intervene as parties defendant.  <em>See People v. Rivera Zayas,</em> 29 P.R. 423, 430.  It is created by articles of association filed as public records.  Code of Commerce, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 95, 98; <em>compare</em> Civil Code, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1558, 1560.  Where the articles so provide, the <em>sociedad</em> endures for a period prescribed by them regardless of the death or withdrawal of individual members.  Civil Code, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1591, 1596, 1598; Code of Commerce, \xc2\xa7 141.  Powers of management may be vested in managers designated by the articles from among the members whose participation is unlimited, and they alone may perform acts legally binding on the <em>sociedad.</em>  Civil Code, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1583, 1589; Code of Commerce, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102, 106, 125.  Its members are not primarily liable for its acts and debts (Code of Commerce, \xc2\xa7 156), and its creditors are preferred with respect to its assets and property over the creditors of individual members, although the latter may reach the interests of the individual members in the common capital.  Civil Code, \xc2\xa7 1590; <em>see Quintana Bros. &amp; Co. U.S. Ramirez &amp; Co.,</em> 22 P.R. 707, 716.  Although the members whose participation is unlimited are made contingently liable for the debts of the <em>sociedad</em> in the event that its assets are insufficient to satisfy them (Code of Commerce, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 125, 156; <em>see Successors of M. Lamadrid &amp; Co. v. Torrens, Mortorell &amp; Co.,</em> 28 P.R. 824), this liability is of no more consequence for present purposes than that imposed on corporate stockholders by the statutes of some states.  <em>Compare Louisville</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 288 U. S. 482</a></p><p> <em>R. Co. v. Letson, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html#557">43 U. S. 557</a></span>-558; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/566/case.html">Liverpool Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts,</a></span></em> 10 Wall. 566,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/566/case.html#575">77 U. S. 575</a></span>.  These characteristics under the Codes of Puerto Rico give content to their declaration that the <em>sociedad</em> is a juridical person.  That personality is so complete in contemplation of the law of Puerto Rico that we see no adequate reason for holding that the <em>sociedad</em> has a different status for purposes of federal jurisdiction than a corporation organized under that law.  In neither case may nonresidents of Puerto Rico, who have taken advantage of its laws to organize a juridical entity for the purpose of carrying on business there, remove from the Insular Courts controversies arising under local law.</p>\n<p>Respondents\' contention that the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States, and therefore removable irrespective of the citizenship of the defendant, rests upon two grounds:  first, that the suit was brought pursuant to an Act of Congress of April 23, 1928, 45 Stat. 447, and second that the plaintiff in the District Court, the People of Puerto Rico, derives its power as a sovereign political entity from the Organic Act, under which the insular government was organized.</p>\n<p>The Act of Congress first mentioned was adopted as a result of earlier litigation with respect to the present tax.  Respondent and others originally brought suits in the federal District Court of Puerto Rico to enjoin collection of the tax, pending which Congress, by Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1421, forbade the maintenance of any suit in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico to restrain the collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico.  Following that prohibition, this Court, in <em>Smallwood v. Gallardo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/275/56/case.html">275 U. S. 56</a></span>, held that all such injunction cases then pending in the federal courts were abated by the statute, and the suit brought by respondents was accordingly dismissed.  <em>Gallardo v. Havemeyer,</em> 21 F.2d 1012.  Subsequently, Congress passed the law of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 288 U. S. 483</a></p><p> April 23, 1928, by which it was provided that, in cases where the taxpayer had by such suits obtained an injunction restraining collection of the tax, the Treasurer of Puerto Rico should</p>\n<p>"enforce the collection of the tax so enjoined . . . by a suit at law, instead of by attachment, embargo, distraint, or any other form of summary administrative proceeding. . . ."</p>\n<p>Respondents argue that, as the authority to recover the tax by suit, rather than by attachment or other summary method, was conferred by act of Congress, the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States.</p>\n<p>We do not stop to examine the answering contention of petitioner that the act of Congress was not an enabling act, but operated only to preclude resort by the insular government to the summary remedies otherwise available for the collection of the tax.  For we think that, even though petitioner derived its authority to maintain the suit from the act of Congress, it did not arise under the laws of the United States within the meaning of the jurisdictional statutes.</p>\n<p>The suit was brought to recover assessments levied under the act of the Puerto Rican Legislature, but not to enforce a right created by a law of the United States.  No question of interpretation or enforcement of the federal statute appears upon the face of the complaint.  Federal jurisdiction may be invoked to vindicate a right or privilege claimed under a federal statute.  It may not be invoked where the right asserted is nonfederal, merely because the plaintiff\'s right to sue is derived from federal law, or because the property involved was obtained under federal statute.  The federal nature of the right to be established is decisive -- not the source of the authority to establish it.  <em>Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/177/505/case.html">177 U. S. 505</a></span>; <em>Blackburn v.
