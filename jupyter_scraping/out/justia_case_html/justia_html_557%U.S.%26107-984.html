The Clean Water Act (CWA), <em>inter alia,</em> classifies crushed rock as a \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7352(6); forbids its discharge \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as in compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the Act, \xc2\xa7301(a); empowers the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to \xe2\x80\x9cissue permits \xe2\x80\xa6 for the discharge of \xe2\x80\xa6 fill material,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7404(a); and authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to \xe2\x80\x9cissue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in [\xc2\xa7404],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7402(a).

Coeur Alaska obtained a \xc2\xa7404 permit for the slurry discharge from the Corps and a \xc2\xa7402 permit for the lake water discharge from the EPA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent environmental groups (collectively, SEACC) sued the Corps and several of its officials under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the CWA \xc2\xa7404 permit was not \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with law,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A), because (1) Coeur Alaska should have sought a CWA \xc2\xa7402 permit from the EPA instead, just as it did for the lake water discharge; and (2) the slurry discharge would violate the \xe2\x80\x9cnew source performance standard\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA had promulgated under CWA \xc2\xa7306(b), forbidding froth-flotation gold mines to discharge \xe2\x80\x9cprocess wastewater,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes solid wastes, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).  Coeur Alaska and petitioner Alaska intervened as defendants.

Because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court accepts the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation as correct.  <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U.

Thus, says SEACC, the slurry discharge is \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d under CWA \xc2\xa7306(e), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cany owner \xe2\x80\xa6 of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Petitioners and the federal agencies counter that CWA \xc2\xa7404 grants the Corps authority to determine whether to issue a permit allowing the slurry discharge without regard to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard or \xc2\xa7306(e)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.

On the one hand, \xc2\xa7306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new source performance standard is \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without an exception for fill material.  On the other hand, \xc2\xa7404 grants the Corps blanket authority to permit the discharge of fill material\xe2\x80\x94without mentioning \xc2\xa7306.  This tension indicates that Congress has not \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly spoken\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprecise question\xe2\x80\x9d at issue.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A.

For example, each of the two principal regulations seems to stand on its own without reference to the other.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard contains no exception for fill material, and it forbids any discharge of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess wastewater,\xe2\x80\x9d including solid wastes.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).  The agencies\xe2\x80\x99 joint regulation defining fill material includes \xe2\x80\x9cslurry or \xe2\x80\xa6 similar mining-related materials,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7232.2, but contains no exception for slurry regulated by an EPA performance standard.  Additional regulations noted by the parties offer no basis for reconciliation.

The question at issue is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the two agencies\xe2\x80\x99 practice and policy, as recited in the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s internal \xe2\x80\x9cRegas Memorandum\xe2\x80\x9d (Memorandum), which explains that the performance standard applies only to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek, and not to the initial discharge of slurry into the lake.  Though the Memorandum is not subject to sufficiently formal procedures to merit full <em>Chevron </em>deference, the Court defers to it because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Auer, supra</em>, at 461.  Five factors inform that conclusion: The Memorandum (1) confines its own scope to closed bodies of water like the lake here, thereby preserving a role for the performance standards; (2) guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards; (3) employs the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the aquatic environment; (4) does not allow toxic compounds to be discharged into navigable waters; and (5) reconciles \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7306, 402, and 404, and the regulations implementing them, better than any of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 alternatives.  The Court agrees with the parties that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and regulations.

Though SEACC cites three such statements, its arguments are not convincing.

The MOA does not address the question presented by these cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, and is, in fact, consistent with the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill material and that \xc2\xa7306 does not apply to these discharges.

Reg. 31135.  If a discharge does not qualify as fill, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard applies.

The first is whether the Act gives authority to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, or instead to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to issue a permit for the discharge of mining waste, called slurry.  The Corps of Engineers has issued a permit to petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc. (Coeur Alaska), for a discharge of slurry into a lake in Southeast Alaska.  The second question is whether, when the Corps issued that permit, the agency acted in accordance with law.  We conclude that the Corps was the appropriate agency to issue the permit and that the permit is lawful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to the first question, \xc2\xa7404(a) of the CWA grants the Corps the power to \xe2\x80\x9cissue permits\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0for the discharge of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0fill material.\xe2\x80\x9d  86 Stat. 884; 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(a).  But the EPA also has authority to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants.  Section 402 of the Act grants the EPA authority to \xe2\x80\x9cissue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7404. 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(a).   We conclude that because the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge is defined by regulation as \xe2\x80\x9cfill material,\xe2\x80\x9d 40 CFR \xc2\xa7232.2 (2008), Coeur Alaska properly obtained its permit from the Corps of Engineers, under \xc2\xa7404, rather than from the EPA, under \xc2\xa7402.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second question is whether the Corps permit is lawful.  Three environmental groups, respondents here, sued the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the issuance of the permit by the Corps was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  The environmental groups are Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, Sierra Club, and Lynn Canal Conservation (collectively, SEACC).  The State of Alaska and Coeur Alaska are petitioners here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC argues that the permit from the Corps is unlawful because the discharge of slurry would violate an EPA regulation promulgated under \xc2\xa7306(b) of the CWA, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71316(b).  The EPA regulation, which is called a \xe2\x80\x9cnew source performance standard,\xe2\x80\x9d forbids mines like Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s from discharging \xe2\x80\x9cprocess wastewater\xe2\x80\x9d into the navigable waters.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).  Coeur Alaska, the State of Alaska, and the federal agencies maintain that the Corps permit is lawful nonetheless because the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard does not apply to discharges of fill material.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reversing the judgment of the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard applies to this discharge so that the permit from the Corps is unlawful.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Coeur Alaska plans to reopen the Kensington Gold Mine, located some 45 miles north of Juneau, Alaska.  The mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska seeks to make it profitable once more by using a technique known as \xe2\x80\x9cfroth flotation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Coeur Alaska will churn the mine\xe2\x80\x99s crushed rock in tanks of frothing water.  Chemicals in the water will cause gold-bearing minerals to float to the surface, where they will be skimmed off.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At issue is Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s plan to dispose of the mixture of crushed rock and water left behind in the tanks.  This mixture is called slurry.  Some 30 percent of the slurry\xe2\x80\x99s volume is crushed rock, resembling wet sand, which is called tailings.

Solid tailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface returns to the mine to be used again.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than build a tailings pond, Coeur Alaska proposes to use Lower Slate Lake, located some three miles from the mine in the Tongass National Forest.  This lake is small\xe2\x80\x94800 feet at its widest crossing, 2,000 feet at its longest, and 23 acres in area.  See App. 138a, 212a.  Though small, the lake is 51 feet deep at its maximum. The parties agree the lake is a navigable water of the United States and so is subject to the CWA.  They also agree there can be no discharge into the lake except as the CWA and any lawful permit allow.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the life of the mine, Coeur Alaska intends to put 4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake.  This will raise the lakebed 50 feet\xe2\x80\x94to what is now the lake\xe2\x80\x99s surface\xe2\x80\x94and will increase the lake\xe2\x80\x99s area from 23 to about 60 acres.  <em>Id.,</em> at 361a (62 acres), 212a (56 acres).  To contain this wider, shallower body of water, Coeur Alaska will dam the lake\xe2\x80\x99s downstream shore.  The transformed lake will be isolated from other surface water.  Creeks and stormwater runoff will detour around it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 298a.  Ultimately, lakewater will be cleaned by purification systems and will flow from the lake to a stream and thence onward.  <em>Id., </em>at 309a\xe2\x80\x93312a.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Numerous state and federal agencies reviewed and approved Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s plans.

The Corps must apply guidelines written by the EPA pursuant to \xc2\xa7404(b).  See <em>ibid.;</em> 40 CFR pt. 230 (EPA guidelines).  Applying those guidelines here, the Corps determined that Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s plan to use Lower Slate Lake as a tailings pond was the \xe2\x80\x9cleast environmentally damaging practicable\xe2\x80\x9d way to dispose of the tailings.  App. 366a.

And during that temporary disruption, Coeur Alaska will divert waters around the lake through pipelines built for this purpose.  <em>Id.,</em> at 298a.  Coeur Alaska will also treat water flowing from the lake into downstream waters, pursuant to strict EPA criteria.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> see Part I\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, <em>infra</em>.

Pursuant to this authority, the EPA in 1982 promulgated a new source performance standard restricting discharges from new froth-flotation gold mines like Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s.  The standard is stringent: It allows \xe2\x80\x9cno discharge of process wastewater\xe2\x80\x9d from these mines.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that standard to the discharge of water from Lower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants the water may contain.

The Corps permit was not in accordance with law, SEACC argued, for two reasons.  First, in SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s view, the permit was issued by the wrong agency\xe2\x80\x94Coeur Alaska ought to have sought a \xc2\xa7402 permit from the EPA, just as the company did for the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, <em>supra.</em>  Second, SEACC contended that regardless of which agency issued the permit, the discharge itself is unlawful because it will violate the EPA new source performance standard for froth-flotation gold mines.  (This is the same performance standard described above, which the EPA has already applied to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.  See <em>ibid.</em>)<em> </em>SEACC argued that this performance standard also applies to the discharge of slurry into the lake.  It contended further that the performance standard is a binding implementation of \xc2\xa7306.  Section 306(e) of the CWA makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d for Coeur Alaska to \xe2\x80\x9coperate\xe2\x80\x9d the mine \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard.  33 U.

The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s function is different, in regulating fill, from its function in regulating other pollutants, but the agency does exercise some authority.  Section 404 assigns the EPA two tasks in regard to fill material.  First, the EPA must write guidelines for the Corps to follow in determining whether to permit a discharge of fill material.  CWA \xc2\xa7404(b); 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(b).  Second, the Act gives the EPA authority to \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit\xe2\x80\x9d any decision by the Corps to issue a permit for a particular disposal site.  CWA \xc2\xa7404(c); 33 U.

Those regulations provide that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdo not require [\xc2\xa7402] permits\xe2\x80\x9d from the EPA.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s view, this regulation implies that some \xe2\x80\x9cfill material\xe2\x80\x9d discharges are not regulated under \xc2\xa7404\xe2\x80\x94else, SEACC asks, why would the regulation lack a comma before the word \xe2\x80\x9cwhich,\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby imply that only a subset of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarges of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 fill material\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cregulated under section 404.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The agencies, however, have interpreted this regulation otherwise.  In the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 view the regulation essentially restates the text of \xc2\xa7402, and forbids the EPA from issuing permits for discharges that \xe2\x80\x9care regulated under section 404.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.3(b); cf.

Its concession on this point is appropriate because slurry falls well within the central understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9cfill,\xe2\x80\x9d as shown by the examples given by the regulation.

But these extreme instances are not presented by the cases now before us.  If, in a future case, a discharger of one of these solids were to seek a \xc2\xa7404 permit, the dispositive question for the agencies would be whether the solid at issue\xe2\x80\x94for instance, \xe2\x80\x9cfeces and uneaten feed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94came within the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfill.\xe2\x80\x9d  SEACC cites no instance in which the agencies have so interpreted their fill regulation.  If that instance did arise, and the agencies were to interpret the fill regulation as SEACC fears, then SEACC could challenge that decision as an unlawful interpretation of the fill regulation; or SEACC could claim that the fill regulation as interpreted is an unreasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa7404.  The difficulties are not presented here, however, because the slurry meets the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s definition of fill.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than challenge the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 decision to define the slurry as fill, SEACC instead contends that \xc2\xa7404 contains an implicit exception.

Those guidelines do not strip the Corps of power to issue permits for fill in cases where the fill is also subject to an EPA new source performance standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7404 would create numerous difficulties for the regulated industry.  As the regulatory regime stands now, a discharger must ask a simple question\xe2\x80\x94is the substance to be discharged fill material or not?  The fill regulation, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7232.2, offers a clear answer to that question; and under the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 view, that answer decides the matter\xe2\x80\x94if the discharge is fill, the discharger must seek a \xc2\xa7404 permit from the Corps; if not, only then must the discharger consider whether any EPA performance standard applies, so that the discharger requires a \xc2\xa7402 permit from the EPA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, however, the discharger would face a more difficult problem.  The discharger would have to ask\xe2\x80\x94is the fill material also subject to one of the many hundreds of EPA performance standards, so that the permit must come from the EPA, not the Corps?  The statute gives no indication that Congress intended to burden industry with that confusing division of permit authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulatory scheme discloses a defined, and workable, line for determining whether the Corps or the EPA has the permit authority.  Under this framework, the Corps of Engineers, and not the EPA, has authority to permit Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s discharge of the slurry.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second question remains: In issuing the permit did the Corps act in violation of a statutory mandate so that the issuance was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in accordance with law\xe2\x80\x9d?  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  SEACC contends that the slurry discharge will violate the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard and that the Corps permit is made \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d by CWA \xc2\xa7306(e).  Petitioners and the agencies argue that the permit is lawful because the EPA performance standard, and \xc2\xa7306(e), do not apply to fill material regulated by the Corps.  In order to determine whether the Corps permit is lawful we must answer the question: Do EPA performance standards, and \xc2\xa7306(e), apply to discharges of fill material?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We address in turn the statutory text of the CWA, the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 regulations construing it, and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent interpretation of those regulations.  Because Congress has not \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly spoken\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprecise question\xe2\x80\x9d of whether an EPA performance standard applies to discharges of fill material, the statute alone does not resolve the case.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842 (1984).  We look first to the agency regulations, which are entitled to deference if they resolve the ambiguity in a reasonable manner.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see <em>United States </em>v.<em> Mead Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 226\xe2\x80\x93227 (2001).  But the regulations, too, are ambiguous, so we next turn to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent interpretation of those regulations.  <em>Id., </em>at 234\xe2\x80\x93238; <em>Auer,</em> 519 U. S., at 461.  In an internal memorandum the EPA explained that its performance standards do not apply to discharges of fill material.  That interpretation is not \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and so we accept it as correct.  <em>Ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Though SEACC contends that the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 published statements and prior practice, we disagree with SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s reading of those statements and of the regulatory record.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the statutory argument, SEACC claims the CWA \xc2\xa7404 permit is unlawful because \xc2\xa7306(e) forbids the slurry discharge.  Petitioners and the federal agencies, in contrast, contend that \xc2\xa7306(e) does not apply to the slurry discharge.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To address SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s statutory argument, it is necessary to review the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities under the CWA.  As noted, \xc2\xa7306 empowers the EPA to regulate the froth-flotation gold mining industry.  See 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71316(b).  Pursuant to this authority, EPA promulgated the new source performance standard relied upon by SEACC.  The standard is stringent.  If it were to apply here, it would allow \xe2\x80\x9cno discharge of process wastewater\xe2\x80\x9d from the mine.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess wastewater\xe2\x80\x9d includes solid waste.  So the regulation forbids not only pollutants that dissolve in water but also solid pollutants suspended in water\xe2\x80\x94what the agency terms \xe2\x80\x9ctotal suspended solids,\xe2\x80\x9d or TSS.  See \xc2\xa7440.104(a) (limiting the amount of TSS from other kinds of mines); see also EPA Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category 157\xe2\x80\x93158 (Nov. 1982) (the amount of TSS in \xe2\x80\x9cwastewater\xe2\x80\x9d from froth-flotation mines is \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally high\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 175 (Table VI\xe2\x80\x936) (measuring the amounts of TSS in samples of froth-flotation mines\xe2\x80\x99 discharges); <em>id.,</em> at 194 (stating an intent to \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d TSS); <em>id., </em>at 402 (evaluating the costs of constructing a \xe2\x80\x9csettling pond\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 535 (concluding that even in mountainous regions, a froth-flotation mine will be able to construct a \xe2\x80\x9ctailings impoundment\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a disposal area for mill tailings\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were there any doubt about whether the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard forbade solids as well as soluble pollutants, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s action in these cases would resolve it.  Here, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7402 permit authorizes Coeur Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into a downstream creek, provided the water meets the quality requirements set by the performance standard.  This demonstrates that the performance standard regulates solid waste.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s permit not only restricts the amount of total suspended solids, App. 327a (Table 3), but also forbids the mine from allowing any \xe2\x80\x9cfloating solids\xe2\x80\x9d to flow from the lake.  <em>Id.,</em> at 328a.  No party disputes the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate these discharges of solid mining waste; and no party questions the validity of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard when it is applicable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the performance standard applies to a point source, \xc2\xa7306(e) makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d for that point source to violate it: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.\xe2\x80\x9d  CWA \xc2\xa7306(e), 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71316(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC argues that this provision, \xc2\xa7306(e), forbids the mine from discharging slurry into Lower Slate Lake.  SEACC contends the new source performance standard is, in the words of \xc2\xa7306(e), \xe2\x80\x9capplicable to\xe2\x80\x9d the mine.  Both the text of the performance standard and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s application of it to the discharge of mining waste from Lower Slate Lake demonstrate that the performance standard is \xe2\x80\x9capplicable to\xe2\x80\x9d Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s mine in some circumstances.  And so, SEACC reasons, it follows that because the new source performance standard forbids even minute discharges of solid waste, it also forbids the slurry discharge, 30% of which is solid waste.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For their part, the State of Alaska and the federal agencies claim that the Act is unambiguous in the opposite direction.  They rely on \xc2\xa7404 of the Act.  As explained above, that section authorizes the Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue a permit allowing the discharge of the slurry.  Petitioners and the agencies argue that \xc2\xa7404 grants the Corps authority to do so without regard to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard or the \xc2\xa7306(e) prohibition discussed above.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners and the agencies make two statutory arguments based on \xc2\xa7404\xe2\x80\x99s silence in regard to \xc2\xa7306.  First, they note that nothing in \xc2\xa7404 requires the Corps to consider the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard or the \xc2\xa7306(e) prohibition.  That silence advances the argument that \xc2\xa7404\xe2\x80\x99s grant of authority to \xe2\x80\x9cissue permits\xe2\x80\x9d contradicts \xc2\xa7306(e)\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that discharges in violation of new source performance standards are \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, petitioners and the agencies point to \xc2\xa7404(p), which protects \xc2\xa7404 permitees from enforcement actions by the EPA or private citizens:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCompliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0shall be deemed compliance, for purposes of sections 1319 [CWA \xc2\xa7309] and 1365 [CWA \xc2\xa7505] of this title, with sections 1311 [CWA \xc2\xa7301], 1317 [CWA \xc2\xa7307], and 1343 [CWA \xc2\xa7403] of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(p).</p>\n<p align="left">\nHere again, their argument is that silence is significant.  Section 404(p) protects the permitee from lawsuits alleging violations of CWA \xc2\xa7301 (which bars the discharge of \xe2\x80\x9cany pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as in compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the Act), \xc2\xa7307 (which bars the discharge of \xe2\x80\x9ctoxic pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d); and \xc2\xa7403 (which bars discharges into the sea).  But \xc2\xa7404(p) does not<em> </em>in express terms protect the permitee from a lawsuit alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7306(e) or of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standards.  Section 404(p)\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding \xc2\xa7306 is made even more significant because a parallel provision in \xc2\xa7402 does protect a \xc2\xa7402 permitee from an enforcement action alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7306.  CWA \xc2\xa7402(k), 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(k).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 omission of \xc2\xa7306 from \xc2\xa7404, and its inclusion of \xc2\xa7306 in \xc2\xa7402(k), is evidence that Congress did not intend \xc2\xa7306(e) to apply to Corps \xc2\xa7404 permits or to discharges of fill material.  If \xc2\xa7306 did apply, then the Corps would be required to evaluate each permit application for compliance with \xc2\xa7306, and issue a permit only if it found the discharge would comply with \xc2\xa7306.  But even if that finding were made, it is not clear that the \xc2\xa7404 permitee would be protected from a suit seeking a judicial determination that the discharge violates \xc2\xa7306.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether \xc2\xa7306 applies to discharges of fill material regulated under \xc2\xa7404.  On the one hand, \xc2\xa7306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new source performance standard is \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without any exception for fill material.  On the other hand, \xc2\xa7404 grants the Corps blanket authority to permit the discharge of fill material\xe2\x80\x94without any mention of \xc2\xa7306.  This tension indicates that Congress has not \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly spoken\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprecise question\xe2\x80\x9d of whether \xc2\xa7306 applies to discharges of fill material.  <em>Chevron, </em>467 U. S., at 842.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before turning to how the agencies have resolved that question, we consider the formal regulations that bear on \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7306 and 404.  See <em>Mead</em>, 533 U. S., at 234\xe2\x80\x93238.  The regulations, like the statutes, do not address the question whether \xc2\xa7306, and the EPA new source performance standards promulgated under it, apply to \xc2\xa7404 permits and the discharges they authorize.  There is no regulation, for example, interpreting \xc2\xa7306(e)\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstandard of performance applicable to such source\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to mean that a performance standard ceases to be \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d the moment the discharge qualifies as fill material, which would resolve the cases in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  Nor is there a regulation providing that the Corps, in deciding whether to grant a permit under \xc2\xa7404, must deny that permit if the discharge would violate \xc2\xa7306(e), which would decide the cases for SEACC.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than address the tension between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7306 and 404, the regulations instead implement the statutory framework without elaboration on this point.  Each of the two principal regulations, which have been mentioned above, seems to stand on its own without reference to the other.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard contains no exception for fill material; and it forbids any discharge of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess wastewater,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that includes solid wastes.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1); see Part III\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x931, <em>supra.</em>  The agencies\xe2\x80\x99 joint regulation defining fill material is also unqualified.  It includes \xe2\x80\x9cslurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials\xe2\x80\x9d in its definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of fill material,\xe2\x80\x9d 40 CFR \xc2\xa7232.2; and it contains no exception for slurry that is regulated by an EPA performance standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties point to additional regulations, but these provisions do not offer a clear basis of reconciliation.  An EPA regulation, mentioned above, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdo not require [\xc2\xa7402] permits\xe2\x80\x9d from the EPA.  \xc2\xa7122.3.  As we have explained, however, this merely states that a permit for this discharge cannot be issued by the EPA.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  The regulation does not answer the question whether the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard, and \xc2\xa7306(e), apply to a discharge regulated by the Corps under \xc2\xa7404.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The agencies also direct us to the \xc2\xa7404(b) guidelines written by the EPA to guide the Corps permitting decision.  See 40 CFR pt. 230.  The agencies note that these guidelines do not expressly require the Corps, in issuing a permit, to consider whether the discharge would violate EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standards.  Here we think failure to mention \xc2\xa7306 or the EPA new source performance standards does offer some indication that these are not relevant to the \xc2\xa7404 permit, though the argument falls short of being conclusive.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 own regulations require the agency to evaluate permit applications \xe2\x80\x9cfor compliance with applicable [EPA] effluent limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(d) (2008).  The regulations do not answer whether the new source performance standard is \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to a discharge of fill material.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations do not give a definitive answer to the question whether \xc2\xa7306 applies to discharges regulated by the Corps under \xc2\xa7404, but we do find that agency interpretation and agency application of the regulations are instructive and to the point.  <em>Auer</em>, 519 U. S., at 461.  The question is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the practice and policy of the two agencies, all as recited in a memorandum written in May 2004 by Diane Regas, then the Director of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, to Randy Smith, the Director of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regional Office of Water with responsibility over the mine.  App. 141a\xe2\x80\x93149a (Regas Memorandum).  The Memorandum, though not subject to sufficiently formal procedures to merit <em>Chevron </em>deference, see <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 234\xe2\x80\x93238, is entitled to a measure of deference because it interprets the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 own regulatory scheme.  See <em>Auer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 461.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Regas Memorandum explains:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAs a result [of the fact that the discharge is regulated under \xc2\xa7404], the regulatory regime applicable to discharges under section 402, including effluent limitations guidelines and standards, such as those applicable to gold ore mining\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0do not apply to the placement of tailings into the proposed impoundment [of Lower Slate Lake]<em>.</em>  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.3(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 144a\xe2\x80\x93145a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe regulation that the Memorandum cites\xe2\x80\x9440 CFR \xc2\xa7122.3\xe2\x80\x94is one we considered above and found ambiguous.  That regulation provides: \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdo not require [\xc2\xa7402] permits.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Regas Memorandum takes an instructive interpretive step when it explains that because the discharge \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not require\xe2\x80\x9d an EPA permit, <em>ibid.</em>, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the discharge.  App. 145a.  The Memorandum presents a reasonable interpretation of the regulatory regime.  We defer to the interpretation because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer, supra</em>, at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Five factors inform that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard.  It confines the Memorandum\xe2\x80\x99s scope to closed bodies of water, like the lake here.  App. 142a\xe2\x80\x93143a, n.\xc2\xa01.  When slurry is discharged into a closed body of water, the Memorandum explains, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard retains an important role in regulating the discharge into surrounding waters.  The Memorandum does not purport to invalidate the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Memorandum acknowledges that this is not an instance in which the discharger attempts to evade the requirements of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard.  The Kensington Mine is not, for example, a project that smuggles a discharge of EPA-regulated pollutants into a separate discharge of Corps-regulated fill material.  The instant cases do not present a process or plan designed to manipulate the outer boundaries of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfill material\xe2\x80\x9d by labeling minute quantities of EPA-regulated solids as fill.  The Memorandum states that when a discharge has only an \xe2\x80\x9cincidental filling effect,\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard continues to govern that discharge.  <em>Id.,</em> at 145a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Memorandum\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation preserves the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authority to determine whether a discharge is in the public interest.  See 33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(a)(1); 40 CFR \xc2\xa7230.10.  The Corps has significant expertise in making this determination.  Applying it, the Corps determined that placing slurry in the lake will improve that body of water by making it wider, shallower, and so more capable of sustaining aquatic life.  The Corps determined, furthermore, that the alternative\xe2\x80\x94a heap of tailings larger than the Pentagon placed upon wetlands\xe2\x80\x94would cause more harm to the environment.  Because the Memorandum preserves an important role for the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expertise, its conclusion that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard does not apply is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Regas Memorandum\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not allow toxic pollutants (as distinguished from other, less dangerous pollutants, such as slurry) to enter the navigable waters.  The EPA has regulated toxic pollutants under a separate provision, \xc2\xa7307 of the CWA, and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7404(b) guidelines require the Corps to deny a \xc2\xa7404 permit for any discharge that would violate the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7307 toxic-effluent limitations.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7230.10(b)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, as a final reason to defer to the Regas Memorandum, we find it a sensible and rational construction that reconciles \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7306, 402, and 404, and the regulations implementing them, which the alternatives put forward by the parties do not.  SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s argument, that \xc2\xa7402 applies to this discharge and not \xc2\xa7404, is not consistent with the statute and regulations, as already noted.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing whether the CWA contemplated that both agencies would issue a permit for a discharge.  556 U. S. ___ (2009).  A two-permit regime would allow the EPA to apply its performance standard, while the Corps could apply its \xc2\xa7404(b) criteria.  The parties agree, however, that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and the regulations.  We conclude that this is correct.  A two-permit regime would cause confusion, delay, expense, and uncertainty in the permitting process.  In agreement with all of the parties, we conclude that, when a permit is required to discharge fill material, either a \xc2\xa7402 or a \xc2\xa7404 permit is necessary.  Here, we now hold, \xc2\xa7404 applies, not \xc2\xa7402.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Regas Memorandum\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 regulations is consistent with the regulatory scheme as a whole.  The Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standards; it guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards; it employs the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the aquatic environment; it does not allow toxic pollutants to be discharged; and we have been offered no better way to harmonize the regulations.  We defer to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that its performance standard does not apply to the initial discharge of slurry into the lake but applies only to the later discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC argues against deference to the Regas Memorandum.  In its view the Regas Memorandum is contrary to published agency statements and earlier agency practice.  SEACC cites three agency statements: A 1986 \xe2\x80\x9cmemorandum of understanding\xe2\x80\x9d between the EPA and the Corps regarding the definition of fill material; the preamble to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 current 2002 fill regulation; and comments made by the agencies in promulgating the 2002 fill regulation.  These arguments are not convincing.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1986, to reconcile their then-differing definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cfill material,\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA and the Corps issued a \xe2\x80\x9cmemorandum of agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  51 Fed. Reg. 8871 (MOA).  The memorandum was not made subject to notice-and-comment procedures, but it was published in the Federal Register.  It defined the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cfill material\xe2\x80\x9d until the current definition took effect in 2002.  Brief for Federal Respondents 30\xe2\x80\x9331, n. 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC points to paragraph B(5) of the MOA, which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] pollutant (other than dredged material) will normally be considered by EPA and the Corps to be subject to section 402 if it is a discharge in liquid, semi-liquid, or suspended form or if it is a discharge of solid material of a homogeneous nature normally associated with single industry wastes\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. . These materials include placer mining wastes, phosphate mining wastes, titanium mining wastes, sand and gravel wastes, fly ash, and drilling muds. As appropriate, EPA and the Corps will identify additional such materials.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>51 Fed. Reg. 8872.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt is true, as SEACC notes, that this passage suggests that \xc2\xa7402 will \xe2\x80\x9cnormally\xe2\x80\x9d apply to discharges of \xe2\x80\x9csuspended\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> solid\xe2\x80\x94pollutants.  But that statement is not contrary to the Regas Memorandum, which acknowledges that the EPA retains authority under \xc2\xa7402 to regulate the discharge of suspended solids from Lower Slate Lake into downstream waters.  This passage does not address the question presented by these cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, as to whether the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard applies when the discharge qualifies as fill material.  In fact, the MOA\xe2\x80\x99s preamble suggests that when a discharge qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cfill material,\xe2\x80\x9d the Corps retains authority to regulate it under \xc2\xa7404:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDischarges listed in the Corps definition of \xe2\x80\x98discharge of fill material,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0remain subject to section 404 even if they occur in association with discharges of wastes meeting the criteria in the agreement for section 402 discharges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 8871.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The MOA is quite consistent with the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill material and that \xc2\xa7306 does not apply to these discharges.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC draws our attention to the preamble of the current fill material regulation.  67 Fed. Reg. 31129 (2002) (final rule).  It cites the opening passages of the preamble, which state:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]oday\xe2\x80\x99s rule is generally consistent with current agency practice and so it does not expand the types of discharges that will be covered under section 404.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 31133.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn SEACC\xe2\x80\x99s view, this passage demonstrates that the fill rule was not intended to displace the pre-existing froth-flotation gold mine performance standard, which has been on the books since 1982.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The preamble goes on to say, in a section entitled \xe2\x80\x9cEffluent Guideline Limitations and 402 Permits\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e emphasize that today\xe2\x80\x99s rule generally is intended to maintain our existing approach to regulating pollutants under either section 402 or 404 of the CWA.  Effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance standards (\xe2\x80\x98effluent guidelines\xe2\x80\x99) promulgated under section 304 and 306 of the CWA establish limitations and standards for specified wastestreams from industrial categories, and those limitations and standards are incorporated into permits issued under section 402 of the Act.  EPA has never sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines.  Rather, effluent guidelines restrict discharges of pollutants from identified wastestreams based upon the pollutant reduction capabilities of available treatment technologies.  Recognizing that some discharges (such as suspended or settleable solids) can have the associated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants, we do not consider such pollutants to be \xe2\x80\x98fill material,\xe2\x80\x99 and nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s rule changes that view.  Nor does today\xe2\x80\x99s rule change any determination we have made regarding discharges that are subject to an effluent limitation guideline and standards, which will continue to be regulated under section 402 of the CWA.  Similarly, this rule does not alter the manner in which water quality standards currently apply under the section 402 or the section 404 programs.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 31135.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAlthough the preamble asserts it does not change agency policy with regard to EPA performance standards and \xc2\xa7402 permitting decisions, it is explicit in noting that the EPA has \xe2\x80\x9cnever sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The preamble, then, is consistent with the Regas Memorandum.  If a discharge does not qualify as fill material, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s new source performance standard applies.  If the discharge qualifies as fill, the performance standard does not apply; and there was no earlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC also cites remarks made by the agencies in response to public comments on the proposed fill material regulation.  App. 22a\xe2\x80\x93127a.  These remarks were incorporated by reference into the administrative record.  67 Fed. Reg. 31131.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to a question about whether \xe2\x80\x9cmine tailings\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to section 404 regulation as opposed to section 402\xe2\x80\x9d under the 2002 fill regulation, the agencies stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s final rule clarifies that any material that has the effect of fill is regulated under section 404 and further that the placement of \xe2\x80\x98overburden, slurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials\xe2\x80\x99 is considered a discharge of fill material.  Nevertheless, if EPA has previously determined that certain materials are subject to an [effluent limitation guideline] under specific circumstances, then that determination remains valid.  Moreover,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0permits issued pursuant to section 402 are intended to regulate process water and provide effluent limits that are protective of receiving water quality.  This distinction provides the framework for today\xe2\x80\x99s rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 48a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis statement is not conclusive of the issue.  SEACC notes that this response, like the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s preamble, pledges that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpreviou[s]\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0determination[s]\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to the application of performance standards \xe2\x80\x9cremai[n] valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  But, as noted above, the Regas Memorandum has followed this policy by applying the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.  The response does not state that the EPA will apply its performance standards to discharges of fill material.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The agencies\xe2\x80\x99 published statements indicate adherence to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s previous application and interpretation of its performance standards.  SEACC cannot show that the agencies have changed their interpretation or application of their regulations. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has applied one of its performance standards to a discharge of fill material.  By contrast, Coeur Alaska cites two instances in which the Corps issued a \xc2\xa7404 permit authorizing a mine to discharge solid waste (tailings) as fill material.  See Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 40\xe2\x80\x9342.  SEACC objects that those two \xc2\xa7404 permits authorized discharges that used the tailings to construct useful structures\xe2\x80\x94a dam in one case, a tailings pond in another.  Here, by contrast, SEACC contends that the primary purpose of the discharge is to use a navigable water to dispose of waste.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But that objection misses the point.  The two \xc2\xa7404 permits cited by Coeur Alaska illustrate that the agencies did not have a prior practice of applying EPA performance standards to discharges of mining wastes that qualify as fill material.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SEACC has not demonstrated that the agencies have changed their policy, and it cannot show that the Regas Memorandum is contrary to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 published statements.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We accord deference to the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable decision to continue their prior practice.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962999">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nCOEUR ALASKA, INC.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(a), or as a \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7402 and 306, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71342(a), 1316(a).  Within this zone, the law authorizes the environmental agencies to classify material as the one or the other, so long as they act within the bounds of relevant regulations, and provided that the classification, considered in terms of the purposes of the statutes and relevant regulations, is reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach reflects the difficulty of applying \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7402 and 306 literally to <em>every</em> new-source-related discharge of a \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) applies \xc2\xa7306 new source \xe2\x80\x9cperformance standards\xe2\x80\x9d to a wide variety of discharges, ranging, for example, from those involved in the processing of apples into apple juice or apple cider, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7407.10 (2008); to the manufacturing of cement, \xc2\xa7411.10; to the production of fresh meat cuts by a meat cutter, \xc2\xa7432.60; and to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products by fermentation, \xc2\xa7439.10.  See generally 40 CFR pts. 405\xe2\x80\x93471 (containing more than 800 pages of \xe2\x80\x9cnew source performance\xe2\x80\x9d and effluent limitation regulations).  At the same time the regulations for any one point source often regulate numerous chemicals, minerals, and other substances produced by that point source; in the case of fermentation products, for example, the regulations provide performance standards for roughly 30 different chemicals.  \xc2\xa7439.15.  These \xe2\x80\x9cstandards of performance\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology \xe2\x80\xa6 including, where practicable, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71316(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To literally apply these performance standards so as to forbid the use of any of these substances as \xe2\x80\x9cfill,\xe2\x80\x9d even when, say, they constitute no more than trace elements in dirt, crushed rock, or sand that is clearly being used as \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d to build a levee or to replace dirt removed from a lake bottom may prove unnecessarily strict, cf. \xc2\xa71362(6) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9crock\xe2\x80\x9d), to the point that such application would undermine the objective of \xc2\xa7404, which foresees the use of \xe2\x80\x9cdredged or fill material\xe2\x80\x9d in certain circumstances and with approval of the relevant agencies.  \xc2\xa71344.  At minimum, the EPA might reasonably read the statute and the applicable regulations as allowing the use of such material, say crushed rock, as \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d in some of these situations.  Cf. <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93844 (1984); <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, I recognize the danger that Justice Ginsburg warns against, namely, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hole categories of regulated industries\xe2\x80\x9d might \xe2\x80\x9cgain immunity from a variety of pollution-control standards,\xe2\x80\x9d if, say, a \xc2\xa7404-permit applicant simply adds \xe2\x80\x9csufficient solid matter\xe2\x80\x9d to a pollutant \xe2\x80\x9cto raise the bottom of a water body,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby turning a \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant\xe2\x80\x9d governed by \xc2\xa7306 into \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d governed by \xc2\xa7404.  <em>Post</em>, at 7 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet there are safeguards against that occurring.  For one thing, as the Court recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, it is not the case that <em>any </em>material that has the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effect of \xe2\x80\xa6 [c]hanging the bottom elevation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the body of water is automatically subject to \xc2\xa7404, not \xc2\xa7402.  The EPA has never suggested that it would interpret the regulations so as to turn \xc2\xa7404 into a loophole, permitting evasion of a \xe2\x80\x9cperformance standard\xe2\x80\x9d simply because a polluter discharges enough pollutant to raise the bottom elevation of the body of water.  For another thing, even where a matter is determined reasonably to be \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently falls within \xc2\xa7404, the EPA can retain an important role in the permitting process.  That is because the EPA may veto any \xc2\xa7404 plan that it finds has an \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, wildlife, or recreational areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71344(c).  Finally, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to apply \xc2\xa7306, but to allow permitting to proceed under \xc2\xa7404, must be a reasonable decision; and court review will help assure that is so.  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these cases, it seems to me that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute as permitting the EPA/Corps of Engineers \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d definition to apply to the cases at hand is reasonable, hence lawful.  Lower Slate Lake, located roughly three miles from the Kensington Gold Mine, is 51 feet deep, 800 feet wide, and 2,000 feet long; downstream from the lake is Slate Creek.  Faced with a difficult choice between creating a huge pile of slurry on nearby wetlands or using part of the lake as a storage facility for mine tailings, see App. 294a\xe2\x80\x93298a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x938, the EPA arrived at a compromise.  On the one hand, it would treat mine tailings placed directly into the lake as \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d under the \xc2\xa7404 permitting program.  App. 144a.  The tailings, the EPA recognized, would have the \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate effect of filling the areas of water into which they are discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But it would also treat any spillover of the tailings, or chemicals from the tailings, into any nearby waterway, most particularly Slate Creek (running out of Slate Lake) as requiring a \xc2\xa7402 permit.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7306 \xe2\x80\x9cperformance standard\xe2\x80\x9d would apply and that standard insists upon <em>no discharge of process wastewater at all. </em> <em>Id.</em>, at 145a; see also 40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b).  The EPA reached this result because it recognized that, even though pollutants discharged into the creek might come \xe2\x80\x9cin the form of suspended and settleable solids,\xe2\x80\x9d such solids would \xe2\x80\x9chave, at most, an incidental filling effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 145a.  The EPA thereby sought to apply the distinction it had previously recognized between discharges that have the immediate effect of raising the bottom elevation of water, and those that only have the \xe2\x80\x9cassociated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 67 Fed. Reg. 31135 (2002) (concluding that \xc2\xa7402 applies to the latter); see also Brief for G. Tracy Mehan III as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot say whether the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s compromise represents the best overall environmental result; but I do believe it amounts to the kind of detailed decision that the statutes delegate authority to the EPA, not the courts, to make (subject to the bounds of reasonableness).  I believe the Court\xe2\x80\x99s views are consistent with those I here express.  And with that understanding, I join its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962998">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n557 U.

One must conclude, then, that if today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is <em>not</em> according the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable and authoritative interpretation of the Clean Water Act <em>Chevron </em>deference, it is according some <em>new</em> type of deference\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to be called in the future <em>Coeur Alaska </em>deference\xe2\x80\x94which is identical to <em>Chevron </em>deference except for the name.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s deference to the EPA and the Corps of Engineers in today\xe2\x80\x99s cases is eminently reasonable.

See Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards, 47 Fed. Reg. 54598 (1982).  Existing mills, the Agency found, were already achieving zero discharge; it was therefore practicable, EPA concluded, for new mills to do as well.  <em>Id., </em>at 54602.  Accordingly, under 40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1), new mines using the froth-flotation method, as Coeur Alaska proposes to do, may not discharge wastewater directly into waters of the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The nationwide pollution-control requirements just described are implemented through the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting scheme set forth in \xc2\xa7402 and administered by EPA and the States.  The NPDES is the linchpin of the Act, for it transforms generally applicable effluent limitations into the individual obligations of each discharger.  <em>EPA</em> v. <em>California ex rel.

The discharge of a pollutant is generally prohibited unless the source has obtained a NPDES permit.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>EPA</em> v. <em>National Crushed Stone Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/64/index.html">449 U. S. 64</a>, 71 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 402 authorizes the establishment of the [NPDES], under which every discharger of pollutants is required to obtain a permit.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act also establishes a separate permitting scheme, administered by the Corps, for discharges of \xe2\x80\x9cdredged or fill material.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U.

The \xc2\xa7404 program does not implement the uniform, technology-based pollution-control standards set out, <em>inter alia</em>, in \xc2\xa7306.  Instead, \xc2\xa7404 permits are subject to regulatory guidelines based generally on the impact of a discharge on the receiving environment.  See \xc2\xa71344(b); <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the above-described statutory background indicates, Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s claim to a \xc2\xa7404 permit carries weighty implications.  If eligible for that permit, Coeur Alaska can evade the exacting performance standard prescribed by EPA for froth-flotation mills.  It may, instead, use Lower Slate Lake \xe2\x80\x9cas the settling pond and disposal site for the tailings.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 360a (Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Record of Decision).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under \xc2\xa7306(e) eligible to receive a \xc2\xa7404 permit as a discharge of fill material?  All agree on preliminary matters.  Only one agency, the Corps or EPA, can issue a permit for the discharge.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10, 22.  Only EPA, through the NPDES program, issues permits that implement \xc2\xa7306.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2.  Further, \xc2\xa7306(e) and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s froth-flotation performance standard, unless inapplicable here, bar Coeur Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s proposed discharge.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No part of the statutory scheme, in my view, calls into question the governance of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s performance standard.  The text of \xc2\xa7306(e) states a clear proscription: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U.

Under the standard of performance relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cthere shall be no discharge of process wastewater to navigable waters from mills that use the froth-flotation process\xe2\x80\x9d for mining gold.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7440.104(b)(1).  The Act imposes these requirements without qualification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 404, stating that the Corps \xe2\x80\x9cmay issue permits\xe2\x80\x9d for the discharge of \xe2\x80\x9cdredged or fill material,\xe2\x80\x9d does not create an exception to \xc2\xa7306(e)\xe2\x80\x99s plain command.  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(a).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Section 404 neither mentions \xc2\xa7306 nor states a contrary requirement. <em> </em>The Act can be home to both provisions, with no words added or omitted, so long as the category of \xe2\x80\x9cdredged or fill material\xe2\x80\x9d eligible for a \xc2\xa7404 permit is read in harmony with \xc2\xa7306.  Doing so yields a simple rule: Discharges governed by EPA performance standards are subject to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s administration and receive permits under the NPDES, not \xc2\xa7404.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading accords with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structure and objectives.  It retains, through the NPDES, uniform application of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s core pollution-control requirements, and it respects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 special concern for new sources.  Leaving pollution-related decisions to EPA, moreover, is consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation to that agency of primary responsibility to administer the Act.  Most fundamental, adhering to \xc2\xa7306(e)\xe2\x80\x99s instruction honors the overriding statutory goal of eliminating water pollution, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 particular rejection of the use of navigable waters as waste disposal sites.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  See also 33 U.

A discharge of a pollutant, otherwise prohibited by firm statutory command, becomes lawful if it contains sufficient solid matter to raise the bottom of a water body, transformed into a waste disposal facility.  Whole categories of regulated industries can thereby gain immunity from a variety of pollution-control standards.  The loophole would swallow not only standards governing mining activities, see 40 CFR pt. 440 (effluent limitations and new source performance standards for ore mining and dressing); <em>id.</em>, pt. 434 (coal mining); <em>id.</em>, pt. 436 (mineral mining), but also standards for dozens of other categories of regulated point sources, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>pt. 411 (cement manufacturing); <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>pt. 425 (leather tanning and finishing); <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>pt. 432 (meat and poultry products processing).

Providing an escape hatch for polluters whose discharges contain solid matter, it bears noting, is particularly perverse; the Act specifically focuses on solids as harmful pollutants.  See 33 U.

Congress, as the Court reads the Act, silently upended, in an ancillary permitting provision, its painstaking pollution-control scheme.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.<em> </em>Congress did so, the Court holds, notwithstanding the lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 stated effort \xe2\x80\x9cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity\xe2\x80\x9d of the waters of the United States, 33 U.

His concerns are imaginative, but it is questionable whether they are real.  Apple juice processors, meatcutters, cement manufacturers, and pharmaceutical producers do not ordinarily build levees\xe2\x80\x94and it is almost inconceivable that they would do so using the waste generated by their highly specific<font b="1"> industrial processes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 40 CFR \xc2\xa7411.10 (performance standard for particular cement manufacturing process).<font b="1">  Levee construction generally is undertaken by developers or government, entities not subject to performance standards for such a project.  This litigation, furthermore, does not illustrate the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulty\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Breyer perceives.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1.  Coeur Alaska does not seek to build a levee or return dirt to a lake; it simply wants to use Lower Slate Lake as a waste disposal site.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Breyer identifies are hardly reassuring.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (concurring opinion).  Given today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it is optimistic to expect that EPA or the courts will act vigorously to prevent evasion of performance standards.  Nor is EPA\xe2\x80\x99s veto power under \xc2\xa7404(c) of the Clean Water Act an adequate substitute for adherence to \xc2\xa7306.
