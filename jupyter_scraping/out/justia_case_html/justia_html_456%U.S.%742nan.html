Section 210 of PURPA\'s Title II seeks to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power facilities, and directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in consultation with state regulatory authorities, to promulgate rules to carry out this goal.  Section 210 then requires the state authorities, after notice and hearing, to implement such rules, and authorizes the FERC to exempt cogeneration and small power facilities from certain state and federal regulations.  The State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (appellees) brought an action in Federal District Court against the FERC and the Secretary of Energy (appellants), seeking a declaratory judgment that Titles I and III and \xc2\xa7 210 are unconstitutional because they exceed congressional power under the Commerce Clause and constitute an invasion of state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.

We conclude that appellees\' challenge lacks merit, and we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On November 9, 1978, President Carter signed PURPA into law. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Act was part of a package of legislation, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] approved the same day, designed to combat the nationwide energy crisis.</p>\n<p>At the time, it was said that the generation of electricity consumed more than 25% of all energy resources used in the United States.  S.Rep. No. 95-442, p. 7 (1977).  Approximately one-third of the electricity in this country was generated through use of oil and natural gas, and electricity generation was one of the fastest growing segments of the Nation\'s economy.  S.Rep. No. 95-361, p. 32 (1977).  In part because of their reliance on oil and gas, electricity utilities were plagued with increasing costs and decreasing efficiency in the use of their generating capacities; each of these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 456 U. S. 746</a></p><p> factors had an adverse effect on rates to consumers and on the economy as a whole.  S.Rep. No. 95-442 at 9.  Congress accordingly determined that conservation by electricity utilities of oil and natural gas was essential to the success of any effort to lessen the country\'s dependence on foreign oil, to avoid a repetition of the shortage of natural gas that had been experienced in 1977, and to control consumer costs.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Titles I and III\n</em></p>\n<p>PURPA\'s Titles I and III, which relate to regulatory policies for electricity and gas utilities, respectively, are administered (with minor exceptions) by the Secretary of Energy.  These provisions are designed to encourage the adoption of certain retail regulatory practices.  The Titles share three goals:  (1) to encourage "conservation of energy supplied by . . . utilities"; (2) to encourage "the optimization of the efficiency of use of facilities and resources" by utilities; and (3) to encourage "equitable rates to . . . consumers."  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101 and 301, 92 Stat. 3120 and 3149, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2611 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3201 (1976 ed., Supp. IV). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  To achieve these goals, Titles I and III direct state utility regulatory commissions and nonregulated utilities to "consider" the adoption and implementation of specific "rate design" and regulatory standards.</p>\n<p>Section 111(d) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2621(d), requires each state regulatory authority and nonregulated utility to consider the use of six different approaches to structuring rates:  (1) promulgation, for each class of electricity consumers, of rates that, "to the maximum extent practicable," would "reflect the costs of . . . service to such class"; (2) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 456 U. S. 747</a></p><p> elimination of declining block rates; [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] (3) adoption of time-of-day rates; [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] (4) promulgation of seasonal rates; [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] (5) adoption of interruptible rates; [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and (6) use of load management techniques. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Act directed each state authority and nonregulated utility to consider these factors not later than two years after PURPA\'s enactment, that is, by November 8, 1980, and provided that the authority or utility, by November 8, 1981, was to have made a decision whether to adopt the standards.  \xc2\xa7 2622(b).  The statute does not provide penalties for failure to meet these deadlines; the state authority or nonregulated utility is merely directed to consider the standards at the first rate proceeding initiated by the authority after November 9, 1980.  \xc2\xa7 2622(c).</p>\n<p>Section 113 of PURPA, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2623, requires each state regulatory authority and nonregulated utility to consider the adoption of a second set of standards relating to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 456 U. S. 748</a></p><p> terms and conditions of electricity service:  (1) prohibition of master metering in new buildings; [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] (2) restrictions on the use of automatic adjustment clauses; [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] (3) disclosure to consumers of information regarding rate schedules; (4) promulgation of procedural requirements relating to termination of service; and (5) prohibition of the recovery of advertising costs from consumers.  Similarly, \xc2\xa7 303, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3203, requires consideration of the last two standards -- procedures for termination of service and the nonrecovery of advertising costs -- for natural gas utilities.  A decision as to the standards contained in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 113 and 303 was to have been made by November, 1980, although, again, no penalty was provided by the statute for failure to meet the deadline.</p>\n<p>Finally, \xc2\xa7 114 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2624, directs each state authority and nonregulated utility to consider promulgation of "lifeline rates" -- that is, lower rates for service that meets the essential needs of residential consumers -- if such rates have not been adopted by November, 1980.</p>\n<p>Titles I and III also prescribe certain procedures to be followed by the state regulatory authority and the nonregulated utility when considering the proposed standards.  Each standard is to be examined at a public hearing after notice, and a written statement of reasons must be made available to the public if the standards are not adopted.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2621(b) and (c)(2), and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2623(a) and (c); 15  S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3203(a) and (c).  "Any person" may bring an action in state court to enforce the obligation to hold a hearing and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="749">Page 456 U. S. 749</a></p><p> make determinations on the PURPA standards.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2633(c)(1); 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3207(b)(1).</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Energy, any affected utility, and any consumer served by an affected utility is given the right to intervene and participate in any rate-related proceeding considering the Title I standards.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2631(a).  Under Title III, the Secretary alone has the right to intervene.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3205.  Any person (including the Secretary) who intervenes or otherwise participates in the proceeding may obtain review in state court of any administrative determination concerning the Title I standards, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2633 (c)(1), and the Secretary has the right to participate as an <em>amicus</em> in any Title III judicial review proceeding initiated by another.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3207(b)(2).  The right to intervene is enforceable against the state regulatory authority by an action in federal court.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2633(b); 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3207(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Titles I and III also set forth certain reporting requirements.  Within one year of PURPA\'s enactment, and annually thereafter for 10 years, each state regulatory authority and nonregulated utility is to report to the Secretary "respecting its consideration of the standards established."  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2626(a); 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3209(a).  The Secretary, in turn, is to submit a summary and analysis of these reports to Congress.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2626(b); 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3209(b).  Electricity utilities also are required to collect information concerning their service costs.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2643.  This information is to be filed periodically with appellant Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and with appropriate state regulatory agencies, and is to be made available to the public.  Title III requires the Secretary, in consultation with FERC, state regulatory authorities, gas utilities, and gas consumers, to submit a report to Congress on gas utility rate design.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3206.</p>\n<p>Despite the extent and detail of the federal proposals, however, no state authority or nonregulated utility is required to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 456 U. S. 750</a></p><p> adopt or implement the specified rate design or regulatory standards.  Thus, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2621(a) and 2623(a) and 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3203(a) all provide:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated . . . utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement [or adopt] any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law."</p>\n<p>Similarly, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2627(b) and 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3208 make it clear that any state regulatory authority or nonregulated utility may adopt regulations or rates that are "different from any standard established by this [subchapter or] chapter."</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Section 210\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 210 of PURPA\'s Title II, 92 Stat. 3144, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3, seeks to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] Congress believed that increased use of these sources of energy would reduce the demand for traditional fossil fuels.  But it also felt that two problems impeded the development of nontraditional generating facilities:  (1) traditional electricity utilities were reluctant to purchase power from, and to sell power to, the nontraditional facilities, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and (2) the regulation of these alternative energy sources by state and federal utility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 456 U. S. 751</a></p><p> authorities imposed financial burdens upon the nontraditional facilities, and thus discouraged their development. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>In order to overcome the first of these perceived problems, \xc2\xa7 210(a) directs FERC, in consultation with state regulatory authorities, to promulgate "such rules as it determines necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production," including rules requiring utilities to offer to sell electricity to, and purchase electricity from, qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.  Section 210(f), 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(f), requires each state regulatory authority and nonregulated utility to implement FERC\'s rules.  And \xc2\xa7 210(h), 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(h), authorizes FERC to enforce this requirement in federal court against any state authority or nonregulated utility; if FERC fails to act after request, any qualifying utility may bring suit.</p>\n<p>To solve the second problem perceived by Congress, \xc2\xa7 210(e), 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(e), directs FERC to prescribe rules exempting the favored cogeneration and small power facilities from certain state and federal laws governing electricity utilities.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this statutory authorization, FERC has adopted regulations relating to purchases and sales of electricity to and from cogeneration and small power facilities.  <em>See</em> 18 CFR pt. 292 (1980); 45 Fed.Reg. 12214-12237 (1980).  These afford state regulatory authorities and nonregulated utilities latitude in determining the manner in which the regulations are to be implemented.  Thus, a state commission may comply with the statutory requirements by issuing regulations, by resolving disputes on a case-by-case basis, or by taking any other action reasonably designed to give effect to FERC\'s rules. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 456 U. S. 752</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In April, 1979, the State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Service Commission, appellees here, filed this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against FERC and the Secretary of Energy, seeking a declaratory judgment that PURPA\'s Titles I and III and \xc2\xa7 210 are unconstitutional.  App. 3. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Appellees maintained that PURPA was beyond the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause and that it constituted an invasion of state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court, in an unreported opinion, held that, in enacting PURPA, Congress had exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause.

The court observed that the Mississippi Public Service Commission, by state statute, possessed the "power and authority to regulate and control intrastate activities and policies of all utilities operating within the sovereign state of Mississippi." <em>Id.</em> at 2a.

Congress there determined that</p>\n<p>"the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, the preservation of national security, and the proper exercise of congressional authority under the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce require,"</p>\n<p>among other things, a program for increased conservation of electric energy, increased efficiency in the use of facilities and resources by electricity utilities, and equitable retail rates for electricity consumers, as well as a program to improve the wholesale distribution of electric energy, and a program for the conservation of natural gas while ensuring that rates to gas consumers are equitable.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2601.  The findings, thus, are clear and specific.</p>\n<p>The Court heretofore has indicated that federal regulation of intrastate power transmission may be proper because of the interstate nature of the generation and supply of electric power.  <em>FPC v.

Committees in both Houses of Congress noted the magnitude of the Nation\'s energy problems and the need to alleviate those problems by promoting energy conservation and more efficient use of energy resources.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 95-442, at 7-10; H.R.Rep. No. 95-543, vol. I, pp. 5-10 (1977); H.R.Rep. No. 95-496, pt. 4, pp. 3-7, 125-130 (1977). [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Congress was aware that domestic oil production had lagged behind demand, and that the Nation had become increasingly dependent on foreign oil.  <em>Id.</em> at 3.  The House Committee observed:</p>\n<p>"Reliance upon imported oil to meet the bulk of U.S. oil demands could seriously jeopardize the stability of the Nation\'s economy and could undermine the independence of the United States."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-543, vol. I, at 5-6.  Indeed, the Nation had recently experienced severe shortages in its supplies of natural gas.  <em>Id.</em> at 7.  The House and Senate Committees both noted that the electricity industry consumed more than 25% of the total energy resources used in this country, while supplying only 12% of the user demand for energy.  S.Rep. No. 95442, at 7; H.R.Rep. No. 9496, pt. 4, at 125.  In recent years, the electricity utility industry had been beset by numerous problems, <em>id.</em> at 129, which resulted in higher bills for the consuming public, a result exacerbated by the rate structures employed by most utilities.  S.Rep. No. 95-442, at 26.  Congress naturally concluded that the energy problem </p><p><a class="page-number" name="757">Page 456 U. S. 757</a></p><p> was nationwide in scope, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] and that these developments demonstrated the need to establish federal standards regarding retail sales of electricity, as well as federal attempts to encourage conservation and more efficient use of scarce energy resources.  <em>See id.</em> at 24-32; H.R.Rep. No. 95-496, pt. 4, at 131-133, 136-138, 170-171.</p>\n<p>Congress also determined that the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities would conserve energy.  The evidence before Congress showed the potential contribution of these sources of energy:  it was estimated that, if proper incentives were provided, industrial cogeneration alone could account for 7-10% of the Nation\'s electrical generating capacity by 1987.  S.Rep. No. 95-442, at 21, 23.</p>\n<p>We agree with appellants that it is difficult to conceive of a more basic element of interstate commerce than electric energy, a product used in virtually every home and every commercial or manufacturing facility.  No State relies solely on its own resources in this respect.  <em>See FPC v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., supra.</em>  Indeed, the utilities involved in this very case, Mississippi Power &amp; Light Company and Mississippi Power Company, sell their retail customers power that is generated in part beyond Mississippi\'s borders, and offer reciprocal services to utilities in other States.  App. 93-94.  The intrastate activities of these utilities, although regulated by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, bring them within the reach of Congress\' power over interstate commerce.  <em>See FPC v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/453/case.html#458">404 U. S. 458</a></span>; <em>New England Power Co. v.

[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if appellees were correct in suggesting that PURPA </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 456 U. S. 758</a></p><p> will not significantly improve the Nation\'s energy situation, the congressional findings compel the conclusion that "<em>the means chosen by [Congress are] reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.\'"  <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., Inc.,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#276">452 U.

It is not for us to say whether the means chosen by Congress represent the wisest choice.  It is sufficient that Congress was not irrational in concluding that limited federal regulation of retail sales of electricity and natural gas, and of relationships between cogenerators and electric utilities, was essential to protect interstate commerce.  That is enough to place the challenged portions of PURPA within Congress\' power under the Commerce Clause. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Because PURPA\'s provisions concern private nonregulated utilities as well as state commissions, the statute necessarily is valid at least insofar as it regulates private parties.  <em>See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., Inc.,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#286">452 U. S. 286</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>The Tenth Amendment\n</em></p>\n<p>Unlike the Commerce Clause question, the Tenth Amendment issue presented here is somewhat novel.  This case obviously is related to <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976), insofar as both concern principles of state sovereignty.  But there is a significant difference as well.  <em>National League of Cities,</em> like <em>Fry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/542/case.html">421 U. S. 542</a></span> (1975), presented a problem the Court often confronts:  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 456 U. S. 759</a></p><p> the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations.  In PURPA, in contrast, the Federal Government attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals.  To an extent, this presents an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p>PURPA, for all its complexity, contains essentially three requirements:  (1) \xc2\xa7 210 has the States enforce standards promulgated by FERC; (2) Titles I and III direct the States to consider specified ratemaking standards; and (3) those Titles impose certain procedures on state commissions.  We consider these three requirements in turn:</p>\n<p>A. Section 210.  On its face, this appears to be the most intrusive of PURPA\'s provisions.  The question of its constitutionality, however, is the easiest to resolve.  Insofar as \xc2\xa7 210 authorizes FERC to exempt qualified power facilities from "State laws and regulations," it does nothing more than preempt conflicting state enactments in the traditional way.  Clearly, Congress can preempt the States completely in the regulation of retail sales by electricity and gas utilities and in the regulation of transactions between such utilities and cogenerators.  <em>Cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/761/case.html">325 U. S. 761</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/761/case.html#769">325 U. S. 769</a></span> (1945).  The propriety of this type of regulation -- so long as it is a valid exercise of the commerce power -- was made clear in <em>National League of Cities,</em> and was reaffirmed in <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn.:</em>  the Federal Government may displace state regulation even though this serves to "curtail or prohibit the States\' prerogatives to make legislative choices respecting subjects the States may consider important."  452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#290">452 U. S. 290</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Section 210\'s requirement that</p>\n<p>"each State regulatory authority shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, <em>implement</em> such rule (or revised rule) for each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority,"</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(f)(1) (emphasis added), is more troublesome.  The statute\'s substantive provisions require electricity utilities to purchase electricity from, and to sell it to, qualifying cogenerator </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 456 U. S. 760</a></p><p> and small power production facilities.  \xc2\xa7 824a-3(a).  Yet FERC has declared that state commissions may implement this by, among other things, "an undertaking to resolve disputes between qualifying facilities and electric utilities arising under [PURPA]."  18 CFR \xc2\xa7 292.401(a) (1980).  In essence, then, the statute and the implementing regulations simply require the Mississippi authorities to adjudicate disputes arising under the statute.  Dispute resolution of this kind is the very type of activity customarily engaged in by the Mississippi Public Service Commission.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 77-1-31, 77-3-5, 77-3-13(3), 77-3-21, 77-3-405 (1973).</p>\n<p><em>Testa v. Katt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html">330 U. S. 386</a></span> (1947), is instructive and controlling on this point.  There, the Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 34, as amended, created a treble damages remedy, and gave jurisdiction over claims under the Act to state, as well as federal, courts.  The courts of Rhode Island refused to entertain such claims, although they heard analogous state causes of action.  This Court upheld the federal program.  It observed that state courts have a unique role in enforcing the body of federal law, and that the Rhode Island courts had "jurisdiction adequate and appropriate under established local law to adjudicate this action."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#394">330 U. S. 394</a></span>.  Thus, the state courts were directed to heed the constitutional command that "the policy of the federal Act is the prevailing policy in every state," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#393">330 U. S. 393</a></span>, "<em>and should be respected accordingly in the courts of the State.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#392">330 U.

S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/case.html#57">223 U. S. 57</a></span> (1912).\n</em></p>\n<p>So it is here.  The Mississippi Commission has jurisdiction to entertain claims analogous to those granted by PURPA, and it can satisfy \xc2\xa7 210\'s requirements simply by opening its doors to claimants. That the Commission has administrative, as well as judicial, duties is of no significance. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Any other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 456 U. S. 761</a></p><p> conclusion would allow the States to disregard both the preeminent position held by federal law throughout the Nation, <em>cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html">14 U.

S. 340</a></span>-341 (1816), and the congressional determination that the federal rights granted by PURPA can appropriately be enforced through state adjudicatory machinery.  Such an approach, <em>Testa</em> emphasized, "flies in the face of the fact that the States of the Union constitute a nation," and "disregards the purpose and effect of Article VI of the Constitution."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#389">330 U. S. 389</a></span>.</p>\n<p>B. Mandatory Consideration of Standards.  We acknowledge that "the authority to make . . . fundamental . . . decisions" is perhaps the quintessential attribute of sovereignty.  <em>See National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#851">426 U. S. 851</a></span>.  Indeed, having the power to make decisions and to set policy is what gives the State its sovereign nature.  <em>See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U. S. 350</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html#360">433 U. S. 360</a></span> (1977) (State Supreme Court speaks as sovereign because it is the "ultimate body wielding the State\'s power over the practice of law").  It would follow that the ability of a state legislative (or, as here, administrative) body -- which makes decisions and sets policy for the State as a whole -- to consider and promulgate regulations of its choosing must be central to a State\'s role in the federal system.  Indeed, the 19th-century view, expressed in a well-known slavery case, was that Congress "has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/66/case.html">Kentucky v. Dennison,</a></span></em> 24 How. 66,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/66/case.html#107">65 U. S. 107</a></span> (1861).</p>\n<p>Recent cases, however, demonstrate that this rigid and isolated statement from <em>Kentucky v. Dennison</em> -- which suggests that the States and the Federal Government in all circumstances must be viewed as coequal sovereigns -- is not representative of the law today. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  While this Court never </p><p><a class="page-number" name="762">Page 456 U. S. 762</a></p><p> has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations, <em>cf. EPA v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/99/case.html">431 U. S. 99</a></span> (1977), there are instances where the Court has upheld federal statutory structures that, in effect, directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrain from taking certain actions.  in <em>Fry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/542/case.html">421 U. S. 542</a></span> (1975), for example, state executives were held restricted, with respect to state employees, to the wage and salary limitations established by the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.  <em>Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/658/case.html">443 U. S. 658</a></span> (1979), acknowledged a federal court\'s power to enforce a treaty by compelling a state agency to "prepare" certain rules "even if state law withholds from [it] the power to do so."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/658/case.html#695">443 U. S. 695</a></span>. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  And certainly <em>Testa v.

S. 393</a></span>, reveals that the Federal Government has some power to enlist a branch of state government -- there, the judiciary -- to further federal ends. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  In doing so, <em>Testa</em> clearly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 456 U. S. 763</a></p><p> cut back on both the quoted language and the analysis of the <em>Dennison</em> case of the preceding century. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Whatever all this may forebode for the future, or for the scope of federal authority in the event of a crisis of national </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 456 U. S. 764</a></p><p> proportions, it plainly is not necessary for the Court in this case to make a definitive choice between competing views of federal power to compel state regulatory activity.  Titles I and III of PURPA require only <em>consideration</em> of federal standards.  And if a State has no utilities commission, or simply stops regulating in the field, it need not even entertain the federal proposals.  As we have noted, the commerce power permits Congress to preempt the States entirely in the regulation of private utilities.  In a sense, then, this case is only one step beyond <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., supra.</em>  There, the Federal Government could have preempted all surface mining regulations; instead, it allowed the States to enter the field if they promulgated regulations consistent with federal standards.  In the Court\'s view, this raised no Tenth Amendment problem:</p>\n<p>"We fail to see why the Surface Mining Act should become constitutionally suspect simply because Congress chose to allow the States a regulatory role."</p>\n<p>452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#290">452 U.

S. 288</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, here Congress could have preempted the field, at least insofar as private, rather than state, activity is concerned; PURPA should not be invalid simply because, out of deference to state authority, Congress adopted a less intrusive scheme and allowed the States to continue regulating in the area on the condition that they consider the suggested federal standards. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  While the condition here is affirmative in nature -- that is, it directs the States to entertain proposals -- nothing in this Court\'s cases suggests that the nature of the condition makes it a constitutionally improper one.  There is nothing in PURPA "directly compelling" the States to enact a legislative program.  In short, because the two challenged Titles simply condition continued state involvement in a preemptible area on the consideration of federal proposals, they do not threaten the States\' "separate and independent existence," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/71/case.html">Lane County v.

To the contrary, they offer the States a vehicle for remaining active in an area of overriding concern.</p>\n<p>We recognize, of course, that the choice put to the States -- that of either abandoning regulation of the field altogether or considering the federal standards -- may be a difficult one.  And that is particularly true when Congress, as is the case here, has failed to provide an alternative regulatory mechanism to police the area in the event of state default.  Yet, in other contexts, the Court has recognized that valid federal enactments may have an effect on state policy -- and may, indeed, be designed to induce state action in areas that otherwise would be beyond Congress\' regulatory authority.  Thus, in <em>Oklahoma v. CSC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/127/case.html">330 U. S. 127</a></span> (1947), the Court upheld Congress\' power to attach conditions to grants-in-aid received by the States, although the condition under attack involved an activity that "the United States is not concerned with, and has no power to regulate."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/127/case.html#143">330 U. S. 143</a></span>.  The Tenth Amendment, the Court declared,</p>\n<p>"has been consistently construed \'as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end,\'"</p>\n<p><em>ibid.,</em> quoting <em>United States v. Darby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/case.html">312 U. S. 100</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/case.html#124">312 U. S. 124</a></span> (1941) -- the end there being the disbursement of federal funds.  Thus it cannot be constitutionally determinative that the federal regulation is likely to move the States to act in a given way, or even to "coerc[e] the States" into assuming a regulatory role by affecting their "freedom to make decisions in areas of <em>integral governmental functions.\'"  <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., Inc.,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#289">452 U. S. 289</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>Equally as important, it has always been the law that state legislative and judicial decisionmakers must give preclusive effect to federal enactments concerning nongovernmental activity, no matter what the strength of the competing local interests.  <em>See Martin v. Hunter\'s Lessee,</em> 1 Wheat. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html#340">14 U. S. 340</a></span>-341.  This requirement follows from the nature of governmental </p><p><a class="page-number" name="767">Page 456 U. S. 767</a></p><p> regulation of private activity.  "[I]ndividual businesses necessarily [are] subject to the dual sovereignty of the government of the Nation and of the State in which they reside," <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#845">426 U. S. 845</a></span>; when regulations promulgated by the sovereigns conflict, federal law necessarily controls.  This is true though Congress exercises its authority "in a manner that displaces the States\' exercise of their police powers," <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., Inc.,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#291">452 U.

S. 305</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring).  Thus it may be unlikely that the States will or easily can abandon regulation of public utilities to avoid PURPA\'s requirements.  But this does not change the constitutional analysis:  as in <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn.,</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he most that can be said is that the . . . Act establishes a program of cooperative federalism that allows the States, within limits established by federal minimum standards, to enact and administer their own regulatory programs, structured to meet their own particular needs."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#289">452 U.

S. 768</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To be sure, PURPA gives virtually any affected person the right to compel consideration of the statutory standards through judicial action.  We fail to see, however, that this places any particularly onerous burden on the State.  Mississippi, by statute, already grants</p>\n<p>"<em>[a]ny interested person</em> . . . the right to petition the [Public Service] [C]ommission for issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule or regulation,"</p>\n<p>Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 77-3-45 (1973) (emphasis added), and provides that "<em>any party</em> aggrieved by any final finding, order or judgment of the commission shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, of appeal in chancery court."  Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 77-3-67(1) (Supp.1981) (emphasis added).  Indeed, "[a]ny person whose rights may be directly affected by said appeal may appear and become a party. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  And </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 456 U.

Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 77-3-71 (1973).</p>\n<p>It is hardly clear on the statute\'s face, then, that PURPA\'s standing and appeal provisions grant any rights beyond those presently accorded by Mississippi law, and appellees point to no specific provision of the Act expanding on the State\'s existing, liberal approach to public participation in ratemaking. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] In this light, we again find the principle of <em>Testa v. Katt, supra,</em> controlling:  the State is asked only to make its administrative tribunals available for the vindication of federal, as well as state-created, rights.  PURPA, of course, establishes as federal policy the requirement that state commissions consider various ratemaking standards, and it gives individuals a right to enforce that policy; once it is established that the requirement is constitutionally supportable,</p>\n<p>"the obligation of states to enforce these federal laws is not lessened by reason of the form in which they are cast or the remedy which they provide."</p>\n<p><em>Testa v. Katt,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#391">330 U.

S. 57</a></span> (1912).</p>\n<p>In short, Titles I and III do not involve the compelled exercise of Mississippi\'s sovereign powers.  And, equally important, they do not set a mandatory agenda to be considered in all events by state legislative or administrative decisionmakers.  As we read them, Titles I and III simply establish requirements for continued state activity in an otherwise preemptible field. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Whatever the constitutional problems associated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 456 U. S. 770</a></p><p> with more intrusive federal programs, the "mandatory consideration" provisions of Titles I ad III must be validated under the principle of <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn.</em> [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>C. The Procedural Requirements.  Titles I and III also require state commissions to follow certain notice and comment procedures when acting on the proposed federal standards.  In a way, these appear more intrusive than the "consideration" provisions; while the latter are essentially hortatory, the procedural provisions obviously are prescriptive.  Appellants and <em>amici</em> Maryland <em>et al.</em> argue that the procedural requirements simply establish minimum due process standards, something Mississippi appears already to provide, [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] and therefore may be upheld as an exercise of Congress\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 456 U. S. 771</a></p><p> Fourteenth Amendment powers.  We need not go that far, however, for we uphold the procedural requirements under the same analysis employed above in connection with the "consideration" provisions.  If Congress can require a state administrative body to consider proposed regulations as a condition to its continued involvement in a preemptible field -- and we hold today that it can -- there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress\' requiring certain procedural minima as that body goes about undertaking its tasks.  The procedural requirements obviously do not compel the exercise of the State\'s sovereign powers, and do not purport to set standards to be followed in all areas of the state commission\'s endeavors.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Senate vote was taken on October 9, 1978.

Demand varies by hour and season, usually reaching a daily maximum in the afternoon and a seasonal maximum in midsummer or midwinter.  A utility must have enough generating capacity to meet that demand; steps that reduce peak demand also reduce the required amount of generating capacity and the use of "peaking" generating equipment, which frequently is gas- or oil-fueled.  Under time-of-day rates, utilities charge more for electricity consumed during peak load hours.  <em>See id.</em> at 29.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>"Seasonal rates" operate to reduce peak load by imposing higher rates during the seasons when demand is greatest.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>"Interruptible rates" tend to reduce peak load by charging less for service which the utility can interrupt, or stop, during peak demand periods.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>"Load management techniques" are methods used to reduce the demand for electricity at peak times.

Certainly, it is a curious type of federalism that encourages Congress to preempt a field entirely when its preference is to let the States retain the primary regulatory role.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s partial dissent suggests that our analysis is an "absurdity," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#781">456 U.

While these rhetorical devices make for absorbing reading, they unfortunately are substituted for useful constitutional analysis.  For while JUSTICE O\'CONNOR articulates a view of state sovereignty that is almost mystical, she entirely fails to address our central point.</p>\n<p>The partial dissent does not quarrel with the propositions that Congress may preempt the States in the regulation of private conduct, that Congress may condition the validity of State enactments in a preemptible area on their conformity with federal law, and that Congress may attempt to "coerce" the States into enacting nationally desirable legislation.  Given this, the partial dissent fails to identify precisely what is "absurd" about a scheme that gives the States a choice between regulating in conformity with federal requirements or abandoning regulation in a given field.  Though the partial dissent finds <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn.</em> inapposite, in our view, the parallel is striking:  there, the States were directed to legislate consistently with congressional enactments, or not at all; here, the States are asked to regulate in conformity with federal requirements, or not at all.  While it is true that PURPA conditions continued state regulatory activity on the performance of certain affirmative tasks, the partial dissent nowhere explains why -- so long as the field is preemptible -- the nature of the condition is relevant.  And while PURPA\'s requirements, in practice, may be more intrusive and more difficult for the States to avoid than was the legislation at issue in <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn.,</em> JUSTICE O\'CONNOR herself acknowledges that an "evaluation of intrusiveness . . . is simply irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#785">456 U. S. 785</a></span>-786.  Similarly, the difference between PURPA and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 identified by the partial dissent cannot be that only the former affects a "traditional function of state government," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#781">456 U. S. 781</a></span>, for regulation of land use is perhaps the quintessential state activity.  In short, while the area of state action potentially foreclosed by PURPA may be broader than was the case in <em>Hodel</em>, the partial dissent has pointed to no constitutionally significant theoretical distinction between the two statutory schemes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>We believe that this seemingly precise parallel between state and federal procedures suffices to overcome JUSTICE POWELL\'s objections to PURPA, at least where, as here, the statute is subjected to a facial attack.  <em>See also</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T32" name="F32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s partial dissent accuses us of undervaluing <em>National League of Cities,</em> and maintains that our analysis permits Congress to "dictate the agendas and meeting places of state legislatures."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#782">456 U. S. 782</a></span>.  These apocalyptic observations, while striking, are overstated and patently inaccurate.  We hold only that Congress may impose conditions on the State\'s regulation of private conduct in a preemptible area.  This does not foreclose a Tenth Amendment challenge to federal interference with the State\'s ability "to structure employer-employee relationships," 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#851">426 U.

S. 847</a></span>, as was the case in National League of Cities.  It does not suggest that the Federal Government may impose conditions on state activities in fields that are not preemptible, or that are solely of intrastate concern.  And it does not purport to authorize the imposition of general affirmative obligations on the States.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T33" name="F33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>As we note above, PURPA imposes certain reporting requirements on state commissions.  But because these attach only if the State chooses to continue its regulatory efforts in the field, we find them supportable for the reasons addressed in connection with the other provisions of Titles I and III.  Appellees nevertheless suggest that PURPA\'s requirements must fall because compliance will impose financial burdens on the States.  We are unconvinced:  in a Tenth Amendment challenge to congressional activity, "the determinative factor . . . [is] the nature of the federal action, not the ultimate economic impact on the States."  <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Recl. Assn., Inc.,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#292">452 U. S. 292</a></span>, n. 33.  In any event, Congress has taken steps to reduce or eliminate the economic burden of compliance.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T34" name="F34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>Mississippi law provides for reasonable notice in the fixing of rates and conditions of service of utilities.  Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 77-3-33(2) (1973).  It also requires the Public Service Commission to keep a "full and complete record" of all proceedings, \xc2\xa7 77-3-63, and to "make and file its findings and order, and its opinion, if any," \xc2\xa7 77-3-59.  Indeed, the state statute requires that "[a]ll findings of the commission and the determination of every matter by it shall be in writing and placed upon its minutes."  \xc2\xa7 77-1-41.  These "shall be deemed a public record, and shall at all seasonable times be subject to the inspection of the public."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, the requirements that appellees characterize as an extraordinary burden on the State appear to accord few, if any, procedural rights not already established by Mississippi law.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117 <em>et seq.</em> (PURPA), imposes unprecedented burdens on the States.  As JUSTICE O\'CONNOR ably demonstrates, it intrusively requires them to make a place on their administrative agenda for consideration and potential adoption of federally proposed "standards."  The statute does not simply ask States to consider quasi-legislative matters that Congress believes they would do well to adopt.  It also prescribes administrative and judicial procedures that States must follow in deciding whether to adopt the proposed standards.  At least to this extent, I think the PURPA violates the Tenth Amendment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="772">Page 456 U. S. 772</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Most, if not all, of the States have administrative bodies -- usually commissions -- that regulate electric and gas public utility companies.  As these utilities normally are given monopoly jurisdiction, they are extensively regulated, both substantively and procedurally, by state law.  Until now, with limited exceptions, the Federal Government has not attempted to preempt this important state function, and certainly has not undertaken to prescribe the procedures by which state regulatory bodies make their decisions.  The PURPA, for the first time, breaks with this longstanding deference to principles of federalism.</p>\n<p>Now, regardless of established procedures before state administrative regulatory agencies and of state law with respect to judicial review, the PURPA forces federal procedures on state regulatory institutions.  The PURPA prescribes rules directing that</p>\n<p>"the Secretary [of Energy], any affected electric utility, or any electric consumer of an affected electric utility may intervene and participate as a matter of right"</p>\n<p>in regulatory proceedings required by the PURPA respecting electrical rates. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  It directs that "[a]ny person (including the Secretary) may bring an action to enforce" the obligations with respect to electrical rate consideration that the PURPA lays upon state regulatory commissions. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The statute provides that "[a]ny person (including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="773">Page 456 U. S. 773</a></p><p> the Secretary) may obtain [judicial] review of any determination" made by a state regulatory commission regarding the PURPA\'s electrical rate policies. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The foregoing requirements by the PURPA intrude upon -- in effect preempt -- core areas of a State\'s administrative and judicial procedure.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In sustaining these provisions of the Act, the Court reasons that Congress can condition the utility regulatory activities of States on any terms it pleases since, under the Commerce Clause, Congress has the power to preempt completely all such activities.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#765">456 U. S. 765</a></span>-766.  Under this "threat of preemption" reasoning, Congress -- one supposes -- could reduce the States to federal provinces.  But as <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#841">426 U.

That Congress has satisfied the one demonstrates nothing as to whether Congress has satisfied the other. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 456 U.

I believe the same principle must apply to other organs of state government.  It may be true that the procedural provisions of the PURPA that prompt this dissent may not effect dramatic changes in the laws and procedures of some States.  But I know of no other attempt by the Federal Government to supplant state-prescribed procedures that in part define the nature of their administrative agencies.  If Congress may do this, presumably it has the power to preempt state court rules of civil procedure and judicial review in classes of cases found to affect commerce.  This would be the type of gradual encroachment hypothesized by Professor Tribe:</p>\n<p>"Of course, no one expects Congress to obliterate the states, at least in one fell swoop.  If </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 456 U.

Despite the appeal -- and indeed, wisdom -- of JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s evocation of the principles of federalism, I believe precedents of this Court support the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of this Act on this facial attack.  <em>See Hodel v.

The latter, deceptively generous feature of PURPA persuades the Court that the statute does not intrude impermissibly into state sovereign functions.  The Court\'s conclusion, however, rests upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the role that state governments play in our federalist system.</p>\n<p>State legislative and administrative bodies are not field offices of the national bureaucracy.  Nor are they think tanks to which Congress may assign problems for extended study.  Instead, each State is sovereign within its own domain, governing its citizens and providing for their general welfare.  While the Constitution and federal statutes define the boundaries of that domain, they do not harness state power for national purposes.  The Constitution contemplates "an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States," a system in which both the State and National Governments retain a "separate and independent existence."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/700/case.html">Texas v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="778">Page 456 U.

[<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Application of these principles to the present case reveals the Tenth Amendment defects in Titles I and III.  Plainly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 456 U. S. 779</a></p><p> those Titles regulate the "States as States."  While the statute\'s ultimate aim may be the regulation of private utility companies, PURPA addresses its commands solely to the States.  Instead of requesting private utility companies to adopt lifeline rates, declining block rates, or the other PURPA standards, Congress directed state agencies to appraise the appropriateness of those standards.  It is difficult to argue that a statute structuring the regulatory agenda of a state agency is not a regulation of the "State."</p>\n<p>I find it equally clear that Titles I and III address "attribute[s] of state sovereignty."  Even the Court recognizes that "the power to make decisions and to set policy is what gives the State its sovereign nature."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#761">456 U. S. 761</a></span>.  The power to make decisions and set policy, however, embraces more than the ultimate authority to enact laws; it also includes the power to decide which proposals are most worthy of consideration, the order in which they should be taken up, and the precise form in which they should be debated.  PURPA intrudes upon all of these functions.  It chooses 12 proposals, forcing their consideration even if the state agency deems other ideas more worthy of immediate attention.  In addition, PURPA hinders the agency\'s ability to schedule consideration of the federal standards. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Finally, PURPA specifies, with exacting detail, the content of the standards that will absorb the agency\'s time. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="780">Page 456 U. S. 780</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If Congress routinely required the state legislatures to debate bills drafted by congressional committees, it could hardly be questioned that the practice would affect an attribute of state sovereignty.  PURPA, which sets the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 456 U. S. 781</a></p><p> agendas of agencies exercising delegated legislative power in a specific field, has a similarly intrusive effect.</p>\n<p>Finally, PURPA directly impairs the States\' ability to "structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions."  Utility regulation is a traditional function of state government, [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>] and the regulatory commission is the most integral part of that function.  By taxing the limited resources of these commissions, and decreasing their ability to address local regulatory ills, PURPA directly impairs the power of state utility commissions to discharge their traditional functions efficiently and effectively. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court sidesteps this analysis, suggesting that the States may escape PURPA simply by ceasing regulation of public utilities.  Even the Court recognizes that this choice "may be a difficult one," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#766">456 U. S. 766</a></span>, and that "it may be unlikely that the States will or easily can abandon regulation of public utilities to avoid PURPA\'s requirements."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#767">456 U. S. 767</a></span>.  In fact, the Court\'s "choice" is an absurdity, for if its analysis is sound, the Constitution no longer limits federal regulation of state governments.  Under the Court\'s analysis, for example, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">National League of Cities v. Usery,</a></span></em> 426 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 456 U. S. 782</a></p><p> U.S. 833 (1976), would have been wrongly decided, because the States could have avoided the Fair Labor Standards Act by "choosing" to fire all employees subject to that Act and to close those branches of state government. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Similarly, Congress could dictate the agendas and meeting places of state legislatures, because unwilling States would remain free to abolish their legislative bodies. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  I do not agree that this dismemberment of state government is the correct solution to a Tenth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>The choice put to the States by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 91 Stat. 447, 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1201 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. IV), the federal statute upheld in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 456 U.

S. 264</a></span> (1981), and discussed by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#764">456 U. S. 764</a></span>-765,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#768">456 U. S. 768</a></span>, n. 30, is quite different from the decision PURPA mandates.  The Surface Mining Act invites the States to submit proposed surface mining regulations to the Secretary of the Interior.  30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253 (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  If the Secretary approves a state regulatory program, then the State enforces that program.  If a State chooses not to submit a program, the Secretary develops and implements a program for that State.  \xc2\xa7 1254.  Even States in the latter category, however, may supplement the Secretary\'s program with consistent state laws. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  The Surface Mining Act does not force States to choose between performing tasks set by Congress and abandoning all mining or land use regulation.  That statute is "a program of cooperative federalism," <em>Hodel, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#289">452 U. S. 289</a></span>, because it allows the States to choose either to work with Congress in pursuit of federal surface mining goals or to devote their legislative resources to other mining and land use problems.  By contrast, there is nothing "cooperative" about a federal program that compels state agencies either to function as bureaucratic puppets of the Federal Government or to abandon regulation of an entire field traditionally reserved to state authority. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 456 U. S. 784</a></p><p> Yet this is the "choice" the Court today forces upon the States.</p>\n<p>The Court defends its novel decision to permit federal conscription of state legislative power by citing three cases upholding statutes that, "in effect, directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrain from taking certain actions."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#762">456 U. S. 762</a></span>.  <em>Testa v. Katt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html">330 U. S. 386</a></span> (1947), is the most suggestive of these decisions. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  In <em>Testa,</em> the Court held that state trial courts may not refuse to hear a federal claim if "th[e] same type of claim arising under [state] law would be enforced by that State\'s courts."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#394">330 U. S. 394</a></span>.  A facile reading of <em>Testa</em> might suggest that state legislatures must also entertain congressionally sponsored business, as long as the federal duties are similar to existing state obligations.  Application of <em>Testa</em> to legislative power, however, vastly expands the scope of that decision.  Because trial courts of general jurisdiction do not choose the cases that they hear, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 456 U. S. 785</a></p><p> requirement that they evenhandedly adjudicate state and federal claims falling within their jurisdiction does not infringe any sovereign authority to set an agenda. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  As explained above, however, the power to choose subjects for legislation is a fundamental attribute of legislative power, and interference with this power unavoidably undermines state sovereignty.  Accordingly, the existence of a congressional authority to "enlist . . . the [state] judiciary . . . to further federal ends," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#762">456 U. S. 762</a></span>, does not imply an equivalent power to impress state legislative bodies into federal service:</p>\n<p>The Court, finally, reasons that, because Congress could have preempted the entire field of intrastate utility regulation, the Constitution should not forbid PURPA\'s "less intrusive scheme."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#765">456 U. S. 765</a></span>, and n. 29. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  The Court\'s evaluation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 456 U. S. 786</a></p><p> of intrusiveness, however, is simply irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  The Constitution permits Congress to govern only through certain channels.  If the Tenth Amendment principles articulated in <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976), and <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html">452 U. S. 264</a></span> (1981), foreclose PURPA\'s approach, it is no answer to argue that Congress could have reached the same destination by a different route.  This Court\'s task is to enforce constitutional limits on congressional power, not to decide whether alternative courses would better serve state and federal interests. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  I do not believe, moreover, that Titles I and III of PURPA are less intrusive than preemption. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  When Congress preempts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 456 U. S. 787</a></p><p> a field, it precludes only state legislation that conflicts with the national approach.  The States usually retain the power to complement congressional legislation, either by regulating details unsupervised by Congress or by imposing requirements that go beyond the national threshold. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  Most importantly, after Congress preempts a field, the States may simply devote their resources elsewhere.  This country does not lack for problems demanding legislative attention.  PURPA, however, drains the inventive energy of state governmental bodies by requiring them to weigh its detailed standards, enter written findings, and defend their determinations in state court.  While engaged in these congressionally mandated tasks, state utility commissions are less able to pursue local proposals for conserving gas and electric power.  The States might well prefer that Congress simply impose the standards described in PURPA; this, at least, would leave them free to exercise their power in other areas.</p>\n<p>Federal preemption is less intrusive than PURPA\'s approach for a second reason.  Local citizens hold their utility commissions accountable for the choices they make.  Citizens, moreover, understand that legislative authority usually includes the power to decide which ideas to debate, as well as which policies to adopt.  Congressional compulsion of state agencies, unlike preemption, blurs the lines of political accountability, and leaves citizens feeling that their representatives are no longer responsive to local needs. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]</p>\n<p>The foregoing remarks suggest that, far from approving a minimally intrusive form of federal regulation, the Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 456 U. S. 788</a></p><p> decision undermines the most valuable aspects of our federalism.  Courts and commentators frequently have recognized that the 50 States serve as laboratories for the development of new social, economic, and political ideas. [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>]  This state innovation is no judicial myth.  When Wyoming became a State in 1890, it was the only State permitting women to vote. [<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]  That novel idea did not bear national fruit for another 30 years. [<a href="#F3/22" name="T3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>]  Wisconsin pioneered unemployment insurance, [<a href="#F3/23" name="T3/23">Footnote 3/23</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 456 U. S. 789</a></p><p> while Massachusetts initiated minimum wage laws for women and minors. [<a href="#F3/24" name="T3/24">Footnote 3/24</a>]  After decades of academic debate, state experimentation finally provided an opportunity to observe no-fault automobile insurance in operation. [<a href="#F3/25" name="T3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]  Even in the field of environmental protection, an area subject to heavy federal regulation, the States have supplemented national standards with innovative and far-reaching statutes. [<a href="#F3/26" name="T3/26">Footnote 3/26</a>]  Utility regulation itself is a field marked by valuable state invention. [<a href="#F3/27" name="T3/27">Footnote 3/27</a>]  PURPA, which commands state agencies to spend their time evaluating federally proposed standards and defending their decisions to adopt or reject those standards, will retard this creative experimentation.</p>\n<p>In addition to promoting experimentation, federalism enhances the opportunity of all citizens to participate in representative government.  Alexis de Tocqueville understood well that participation in local government is a cornerstone of American democracy:</p>\n<p>"It is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican government in the United States were engendered in the townships and in the provincial assemblies.  [I]t is this same republican spirit, it is these manners and customs of a free people, which are engendered and nurtured in the different States, to be afterwards applied to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 456 U. S. 790</a></p><p> the country at large."</p>\n<p>1 A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 181 (H. Reeve trans.1961). [<a href="#F3/28" name="T3/28">Footnote 3/28</a>]  Citizens, however, cannot learn the lessons of self-government if their local efforts are devoted to reviewing proposals formulated by a faraway national legislature.  If we want to preserve the ability of citizens to learn democratic processes through participation in local government, citizens must retain the power to govern, not merely administer, their local problems.</p>\n<p>Finally, our federal system provides a salutary check on governmental power.  As Justice Harlan once explained, our ancestors "were suspicious of every form of all-powerful central authority."  Harlan, <em>supra,</em> <l=|456 16|="" 742fn3="" u.s.="">n. 16, at 944.  To curb this evil, they both allocated governmental power between state and national authorities and divided the national power among three branches of government.  Unless we zealously protect these distinctions, we risk upsetting the balance of power that buttresses our basic liberties.  In analyzing this brake on governmental power, Justice Harlan noted that</l=|456></p>\n<p>"[t]he diffusion of power between federal and state authority . . . takes on added significance as the size of the federal bureaucracy continues to grow."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F3/29" name="T3/29">Footnote 3/29</a>]  Today, the Court disregards this warning and permits Congress to kidnap state utility commissions into the national regulatory family.  Whatever the merits of our national energy legislation, I am </p><p><a class="page-number" name="791">Page 456 U. S. 791</a></p><p> not ready to surrender this state legislative power to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As explained above, the Court\'s decision to uphold Titles I and III violates the principles of <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976), and threatens the values promoted by our federal system.  The Court\'s result, moreover, is at odds with our constitutional history, which demonstrates that the Framers consciously rejected a system in which the National Legislature would employ state legislative power to achieve national ends.</p>\n<p>The principal defect of the Articles of Confederation, 18th-century writers agreed, was that the new National Government lacked the power to compel individual action.  Instead, the central government had to rely upon the cooperation of state legislatures to achieve national goals.  Thus, Alexander Hamilton explained that</p>\n<p>"[t]he great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confederation is in the principle of legislation for states or governments, in their corporate or collective capacities and as contradistinguished from the individuals of whom they consist."</p>\n<p>The Federalist No. 15, p. 93 (J. Cooke ed.1961) (emphasis omitted).  He pointed out, for example, that the National Government had "an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money," but "no authority to raise either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Constitution cured this defect by permitting direct contact between the National Government and the individual citizen, a change repeatedly acknowledged by the delegates assembled in Philadelphia.  George Mason, for example, declared:</p>\n<p>"Under the existing Confederacy, Congress represent[s] the <em>States,</em> not the <em>people</em> of the States:  their acts operate on the <em>States,</em> not on the individuals. The case will be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 456 U. S. 792</a></p><p> changed in the new plan of Government."</p>\n<p>1 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 133 (M. Farrand ed.1911) (hereinafter Farrand) (abbreviations expanded in this and subsequent quotations).  Hamilton subsequently explained to the people of New York that the Constitution marked the "difference between a league and a government," because it "extend[ed] the authority of the union to the persons of the citizens, -- the only proper objects of government."  The Federalist No. 15, <em>supra,</em> at 95.  Similarly, Charles Pinckney told the South Carolina House of Representatives that</p>\n<p>"the necessity of having a government which should at once operate upon the people, and not upon the states, was conceived to be indispensable by every delegation present; . . . however they may have differed with respect to the quantum of power, no objection was made to the system itself."</p>\n<p>4 Elliot\'s Debates on the Federal Convention 256 (2d ed. 1863).</p>\n<p>The speeches and writings of the Framers suggest why they adopted this means of strengthening the National Government.  Mason, for example, told the Convention that, because "punishment could not [in the nature of things be executed on] the States collectively," he advocated a National Government that would "directly operate on individuals."  1 Farrand 34.  Hamilton predicted that a National Government forced to work through the States would "degenerate into a military despotism" because it would have to maintain a "large army, continually on foot" to enforce its will against the States.  The Federalist No. 16, p. 101 (J. Cooke ed.1961).  <em>See also id.</em> at 102; The Federalist No. 15, <em>supra,</em> at 95-96.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Framers concluded that government by one sovereign through the agency of a second cannot be satisfactory.  At one extreme, as under the Articles of Confederation, such a system is simply ineffective.  At the other, it requires a degree of military force incompatible with stable government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 456 U. S. 793</a></p><p> and civil liberty. [<a href="#F3/30" name="T3/30">Footnote 3/30</a>]  For this reason, the Framers concluded that "the execution of the laws of the national government . . . should not require the intervention of the State Legislatures," The Federalist No. 16, <em>supra,</em> at 103, and abandoned the Articles of Confederation in favor of direct national legislation.</p>\n<p>At the same time that the members of the Constitutional Convention fashioned this principle, they rejected two proposals that would have given the National Legislature power to supervise directly state governments.  The first proposal would have authorized Congress "to call forth the force of the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duty under the articles thereof."  1 Farrand 21.  The delegates never even voted on this suggestion.  James Madison moved to postpone it, stating that,</p>\n<p>"the more he reflected on the use of force, the more he doubted the practicability, the justice and the efficacy of it when applied to people collectively, and not individually."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 54.  Several other delegates echoed his concerns, [<a href="#F3/31" name="T3/31">Footnote 3/31</a>] and Madison ultimately reported that "[t]he practicability of making laws, with coercive sanctions, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 456 U. S. 794</a></p><p> for the States as political bodies [has] been exploded on all hands."  2 <em>id.</em> at 9.</p>\n<p>The second proposal received more favorable consideration.  Virginia\'s Governor Randolph suggested that Congress should have the power "to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the articles of Union."  1 <em>id.</em> at 21.  On May 31, 1787, the Committee of the Whole approved this proposal without debate.  <em>Id.</em> at 61.  A week later, Pinckney moved to extend the congressional negative to all state laws "which [Congress] should judge to be improper."  <em>Id.</em> at 164.  Numerous delegates criticized this attempt to give Congress unbounded control over state lawmaking.  Hugh Williamson, for example, thought "the State Legislatures ought to possess independent powers in cases purely local," <em>id.</em> at 171, while Elbridge Gerry thought Pinckney\'s idea might "enslave the States."  <em>Id.</em> at 165.  After much debate, the Convention rejected Pinckney\'s suggestion.</p>\n<p>Late in July, the delegates reversed their approval of even Randolph\'s more moderate congressional veto.  Several delegates now concluded that the negative would be "terrible to the States," "unnecessary," and "improper."  2 <em>id.</em> at 27. [<a href="#F3/32" name="T3/32">Footnote 3/32</a>]  Omission of the negative, however, left the new system without an effective means of adjusting conflicting state and national laws.  To remedy this defect, the delegates adopted the Supremacy Clause, providing that the Federal Constitution, laws, and treaties are "the supreme Law of the Land," and that "the Judges in every State shall be bound </p><p><a class="page-number" name="795">Page 456 U. S. 795</a></p><p> thereby."  Art. VI, cl. 2.  Thus, the Framers substituted judicial review of state laws for congressional control of state legislatures.</p>\n<p>While this history demonstrates the Framers\' commitment to a strong central government, the means that they adopted to achieve that end are as instructive as the end itself. [<a href="#F3/33" name="T3/33">Footnote 3/33</a>]  Under the Articles of Confederation, the National Legislature operated through the States.  The Framers could have fortified the central government, while still maintaining the same system, if they had increased Congress\' power to demand obedience from state legislatures.  In time, this scheme might have relegated the States to mere departments of the National Government, a status the Court appears to endorse today.  The Framers, however, eschewed this course, choosing instead to allow Congress to pass laws directly affecting individuals, and rejecting proposals that would have given Congress military or legislative power over state governments.  In this way, the Framers established independent state and national sovereigns.  The National Government received the power to enact its own laws and to enforce those laws over conflicting state legislation.  The States retained the power to govern as sovereigns in fields that Congress cannot or will not preempt. [<a href="#F3/34" name="T3/34">Footnote 3/34</a>]  This product of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="796">Page 456 U. S. 796</a></p><p> the Constitutional Convention, I believe, is fundamentally inconsistent with a system in which either Congress or a state legislature harnesses the legislative powers of the other sovereign. [<a href="#F3/35" name="T3/35">Footnote 3/35</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>During his last Term of service on this Court, Justice Black eloquently explained that our notions of federalism subordinate neither national nor state interests:</p>\n<p>"The concept does not mean blind deference to \'states\' Rights\' any more than it means centralization of control over every important issue in our National Government and its courts.  The Framers rejected both these courses.  What the concept does represent is a system in which there is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="797">Page 456 U. S. 797</a></p><p> both State and National Governments, and in which the National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States."</p>\n<p><em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#44">401 U. S. 44</a></span> (1971).  In this case, I firmly believe that a proper "sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both State and National Governments" requires invalidation of Titles I and III of PURPA insofar as they apply to state regulatory authorities.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court\'s decision to uphold those portions of the statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court\'s decision to uphold Title II, \xc2\xa7 210, of PURPA against appellees\' facial attack.  As the Court explains, part of that section permits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to exempt cogeneration and small power production facilities from otherwise applicable state and federal laws.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(e) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  This exemption authority does not violate the Tenth Amendment, for it merely preempts state control of private conduct, rather than regulating the "States as States."  <em>See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html">452 U. S. 264</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#287">452 U. S. 287</a></span>-293 (1981).</p>\n<p>Section 210\'s requirement that the States "implement" rules promulgated by the Secretary of Energy, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(f) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), is more disturbing.  Appellants, however, have interpreted this statutory obligation to include "an undertaking to resolve disputes between qualifying facilities and electric utilities arising under [\xc2\xa7 210], or any other action reasonably designed to implement [that section]."  18 CFR \xc2\xa7 292.401(a) (1981).  It appears, therefore, that state regulatory authorities may satisfy \xc2\xa7 210\'s implementation requirement simply by adjudicating private disputes arising under that section.  As the Court points out, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#760">456 U. S. 760</a></span>-761, the Mississippi Public Service Commission has jurisdiction over similar state disputes, and it is settled that a State may not exercise its judicial power in a manner that discriminates between analogous federal and state causes of action.  <em>See Testa v. Katt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html">330 U. S. 386</a></span> (1947).  Under these circumstances, but without foreclosing the possibility that particular applications of \xc2\xa7 210\'s implementation provision might uncover hidden constitutional defects, I would not sustain appellees\' facial attack on the provision.</p>\n<p>Section 210 also authorizes FERC, electric utilities, cogenerators, and small power producers to "enforce" the above implementation provision against state utility commissions.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 824a-3(h)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  As applied, it is conceivable that this enforcement provision would raise troubling federalism issues.  Once again, however, I decline to accept appellees\' facial challenge to the provision, preferring to consider the constitutionality of this provision in the setting of a concrete controversy.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The statute imposes the same requirements upon nonregulated utilities.  In this respect, it regulates purely private conduct, and does not violate the Tenth Amendment.  Throughout this dissent, I consider only the constitutionality of Titles I and III as applied to state regulatory authorities.  I would allow the District Court, on remand, to decide whether the constitutionally defective aspects of Titles I and III are severable from the unobjectionable portions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#748">456 U. S. 748</a></span>-749.  The Court overlooks several of PURPA\'s procedural mandates.  For example, with respect to six of the standards, the state agency must publish a written determination, including findings, even if it decides to adopt the federal standard.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2621(b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  In addition, PURPA guarantees certain rights to discover information, \xc2\xa7 2631(b); requires the State to provide transcripts, at the cost of reproduction, to parties to ratemaking proceedings or other "regulatory proceeding[s] relating to [electric utility] rates or rate design," \xc2\xa7 2632(c); and, under some circumstances, mandates compensation for reasonable attorney\'s fees, expert witness fees, and other costs to consumers who contribute substantially to the adoption of a Title I standard, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2632 (a), (b).  These requirements, as well as the ones described by the Court, may impose special burdens on state administrative agencies.  I do not weigh the constitutionality of these individual procedural requirements, however, because I would invalidate the entire regimen that Titles I and III impose on state regulatory authorities.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/4" name="F3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>In both <em>Hodel</em> and United <em>Transportation Union,</em> we further noted that, even when these three requirements are met, "the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission."  <em>Hodel,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#288">452 U.

Neither of those cases involved such an exception to <em>National League of Cities,</em> and the Court has not yet explored the circumstances that might justify such an exception.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#748">456 U. S. 748</a></span>, PURPA permits "[a]ny person" to bring an action in state court to enforce the agency\'s obligation to consider the federal standards.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3207(b)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. IV); 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2633(c)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  The Secretary of Energy, moreover, may intervene in any ongoing ratemaking proceeding to require consideration of PURPA\'s standards.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3205(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV); 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2631(a), 2622(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  Title I grants affected utilities and consumers the same right of intervention.  16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2631(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  Because of these rights of intervention and enforcement, state agencies lack even the power to schedule their consideration of PURPA\'s standards.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/6" name="F3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, the proposed standards governing advertising provide that</p>\n<p>"[n]o electric [or gas] utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as [further] defined in . . . this title."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2623(b)(5) (1976 ed., Supp. IV); 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3203(b)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  PURPA then defines the terms "advertising," "political advertising," and "promotional advertising":</p>\n<p>"(1) For purposes of this section and section 2623(b)(5) of this title -- "</p>\n<p>"(A) The term \'advertising\' means the commercial use, by an electric utility, of any media, including newspaper, printed matter, radio, and television, in order to transmit a message to a substantial number of members of the public or to such utility\'s electric consumers."</p>\n<p>"(B) The term \'political advertising\' means any advertising for the purpose of influencing public opinion with respect to legislative, administrative, or electoral matters, or with respect to any controversial issue of public importance."</p>\n<p>"(C) The term \'promotional advertising\' means any advertising for the purpose of encouraging any person to select or use the service or additional service of an electric utility or the selection or installation of any appliance or equipment designed to use such utility\'s service."</p>\n<p>"(2) For purposes of this subsection and section 2623(b)(5) of this title, the terms \'political advertising\' and \'promotional advertising\' do not include -- "</p>\n<p>"(A) advertising which informs electric consumers how they can conserve energy or can reduce peak demand for electric energy,"</p>\n<p>"(B) advertising required by law or regulation, including advertising required under part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. . . ."</p>\n<p>"(C) advertising regarding service interruptions, safety measures, or emergency conditions,"</p>\n<p>"(D) advertising concerning employment opportunities with such utility,"</p>\n<p>"(E) advertising which promotes the use of energy efficient appliances, equipment or services, or"</p>\n<p>"(F) any explanation or justification of existing or proposed rate schedules, or notifications of hearings thereon."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2625(h) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  <em>See also</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3204(b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV) (containing similar provisions for gas utilities).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has not explored fully the extent of "traditional" state functions.  Utility regulation, however, should fall within any definition of that term.  <em>See generally</em> W. Jones, Cases and Materials on Regulated Industries 254 (2d ed.1976) (tracing history of state regulation of utilities).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/8" name="F3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>PURPA thus offends each of the criteria named in <em>Hodel.</em>  I do not believe, moreover, that this is a case in which "the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission."  <em>See</em> <l=|456 4|="" 742fn3="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>supra.</em>  Whatever the ultimate content of that standard, it must refer not only to the weight of the asserted federal interest, but also to the necessity of vindicating that interest in a manner that intrudes upon state sovereignty.  In this case, the Government argues that PURPA furthers vital national interests in energy conservation.  Although the congressional goal is a noble one, appellants have not shown that Congress needed to commandeer state utility commissions to achieve its aim.  Consistent with the Tenth Amendment, Congress could have assigned PURPA\'s tasks to national officials.  Alternatively, it could have requested state commissions to comply with Titles I and III and directed the Secretary to shoulder the burden of any State choosing not to comply.</l=|456></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/9" name="F3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to distinguish <em>National League of Cities,</em> suggesting that it involved</p>\n<p>"the State\'s ability \'to structure employer-employee relationships,\' . . . while providing \'those governmental services which [its] citizens require.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#770">456 U.

In that case, Congress had required the States to pay their employees specified amounts if they wished to continue regulating a variety of preemptible fields.  Here, it has required the States to burden their officials with evaluation of a dozen legislative proposals if they wish to continue regulating private utilities.  To me, the parallel is obvious, not "overstated."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#769">456 U.

The power of a court to enjoin adjudicated violations of federal law, however, is far different from the power of Congress to demand state legislative action in the absence of any showing that the State has violated existing federal duties.  <em>See</em> Hart, The Relations Between State and Federal Law, 54 Colum.L.Rev. 489, 515-516 (1954); Salmon, The Federalist Principle:  The Interaction of the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment in the Clean Air Act, 2 Colum.J.Envtl.L. 290, 334-337 (1976).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/14" name="F3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court suggests, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html#762">456 U.

Whatever the force of that observation, it does not demonstrate <em>Testa\'s</em> relevance to this case.  State legislative bodies possess at least one attribute of sovereignty, the power to set an agenda, that trial courts lack.

The administration\'s original proposal, as well as the version of PURPA approved by the House, would have preempted state law by establishing minimum federal ratemaking standards.  <em>See generally</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1750, pp. 63-65 (1978); S. Conf Rep. No. 95-1292, pp. 63-65 (1978).  The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, however, rejected this approach because</p>\n<p>"the committee felt that setting minimum federal standards for utility rates, or mandating the use of certain costing methods for ratesetting, would be an unnecessary intrusion into an area which has traditionally been regulated by the States.  It was apparent to the committee that many State utility commissions are currently involved in innovative ratemaking, and are working toward the goal of conservation of energy through rate reform.  At present, the State regulatory agencies, rather than the Federal Government, possess the expertise to conduct the detailed costing and demand studies required to implement rate structure revision.  Moreover, the committee recognized that rate structures must reflect the individual needs and local peculiarities of each utilities\' service area. . . .  Finally, the committee felt that the potential uncertainty and delays accompanying Federal regulation threatened to have an adverse impact on the financial health of the utility industry which outweighed the projected savings in capital expenditures claimed by supporters of the administration\'s proposal."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.
