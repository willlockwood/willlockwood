It was sued out to review a final judgment of that court reversing, on appeal, an order of the circuit court and remanding the cause with direction to vacate the same.  Under the local practice, the original papers, that had been transmitted to the supreme court as the record on the appeal, were remitted to the circuit court, with copies of the judgment and opinion of the supreme court (Rev.Code S.D.1919, \xc2\xa7 3170), no copy of such record being retained by the supreme court.  The rule of practice has been long established that, in such case, in order to bring up the record, which is essential to a review of the judgment of the appellate court, the writ of error is properly directed to the lower court in which the record is then found.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/16/246/case.html">Gelston v.

S. 602</a></p><p> the merger of several smaller districts, and praying that the defendants in error, as its officers, be enjoined from further maintaining schools or erecting school buildings therein, or issuing bonds thereof.  The supreme court, on an appeal from the circuit court, held that the attempted organization of the consolidated district "was not authorized by any law then in force . . . and was wholly futile" (43 S.D. 166, 176), and entered judgment remanding the cause for further proceedings in accordance with its decision.  The legislature thereupon passed a curative act legalizing and validating all proceedings relating to the organization of any consolidated school district attempted to be made as this had been, as of the date when such district was organized.  Laws S.D., Sp.Sess.1920, c. 47.  Before this curative act went into effect the circuit court, in accordance with the decision of the supreme court, entered judgment adjudging the invalidity of the consolidation, permanently enjoining the defendants from conducting the consolidated district, as prayed in the complaint, and awarding costs to the plaintiffs.  At a later day of the term, after the curative act had gone into effect, a motion by the defendants to set aside this injunction was denied.  Thereafter, on a second appeal, the supreme court held that the curative act had validated the defective organization of the consolidated district (45 S.D. 149), and entered the judgment now sought to be reviewed, reversing the order of the circuit court granting the permanent injunction and remanding the cause with direction to vacate so much of its judgment as awarded such injunction; but not reversing its judgment as to costs.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in error concede that the legislature, in the general exercise of its inherent power to create and alter the boundaries of school districts, may create new districts by the consolidation of others.  <em>Stephens v. Jones,</em> 24 S.D. 97, 100.  And they likewise recognize that, since the legislature had the power to ratify that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="603">Page 261 U. S. 603</a></p><p> which it might have originally authorized, there would have been no violation of due process if the curative act had been enacted and become effective before any adjudication had been made in the pending litigation as to the invalidity of the consolidated district.  <em>United States v.

The right involved in the present suit, of enjoining the maintenance of an illegal school district and the issuance of its bonds, is likewise a public right shared by the plaintiffs with all other resident taxpayers.  And while, in the <em>Wheeling Bridge</em> case, the bill was filed by the state, although partly in its proprietary capacity as the owner of certain canals and railways (9 How.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/50/647/case.html">50 U. S. 647</a></span>-648), the doctrine that a judgment declaring a public right may be annulled by subsequent legislation applies with like force in the present suit, although brought by individuals primarily for their own benefit, the right involved and adjudged, in the one case as in the other, being public, and not private.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the supreme court in this case affected merely the public right involved -- the plaintiffs\' judgment for costs not being impaired -- and was clearly in accordance with the doctrine of the <em>Wheeling Bridge</em> case.
