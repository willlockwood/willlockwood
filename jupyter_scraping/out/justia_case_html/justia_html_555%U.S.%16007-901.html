ICE</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of oregon</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93901.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 14, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 14, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Ice twice entered an 11-year-old girl\xe2\x80\x99s residence and sexually assaulted her.  For each of the incidents, an Oregon jury found Ice guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching her breasts.  Ice was sentenced under a state statute providing, generally, for concurrent sentences, Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7137.123(1), but allowing the judge to impose consecutive sentences in these circumstances: (1) when \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant is simultaneously sentenced for \xe2\x80\xa6 offenses that do not arise from the same \xe2\x80\xa6 course of conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7137.123(2), and (2) when offenses arise from the same course of conduct, if the judge finds either \xe2\x80\x9c(a) [t]hat the \xe2\x80\xa6 offense \xe2\x80\xa6 was an indication of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9c(b) [t]he \xe2\x80\xa6 offense \xe2\x80\xa6 caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different \xe2\x80\xa6 harm to the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7137.123(5).  The trial judge first found that the two burglaries constituted separate incidents and exercised his discretion to impose consecutive sentences for those crimes under \xc2\xa7137.123(2).  The court then found that each offense of touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vagina met \xc2\xa7137.123(5)\xe2\x80\x99s two criteria, giving the judge discretion to impose the sentences for those offenses consecutive to the two associated burglary sentences.  The court elected to do so, but ordered that the sentences for touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s breasts run concurrently with the other sentences.  On appeal, Ice argued, <em>inter alia,</em> that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, 490, and <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, holding that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee requires that the jury, rather than the judge, determine any fact (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime.  The appellate court affirmed, but the Oregon Supreme Court reversed, holding that the <em>Apprendi</em> rule applied because the imposition of consecutive sentences increased Ice\xe2\x80\x99s quantum of punishment.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>In light of historical practice and the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority over administration of their criminal justice systems, the Sixth Amendment does not inhibit States from assigning to judges, rather than to juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court declines to extend the <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule must honor the \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding common-law practice\xe2\x80\x9d in which the rule is rooted.  <em>Cunningham</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/270/index.html">549 U. S. 270</a>, 281.  The rule\xe2\x80\x99s animating principle is the preservation of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense.  See <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 477.  Because the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s traditional domain, see <em>id</em>.<em>, </em>at 497, the Court considers whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within the jury\xe2\x80\x99s domain by the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 framers, <em>Harris</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/545/index.html">536 U. S. 545</a>, 557.  In so doing, the Court is also cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/197/index.html">432 U. S. 197</a>, 201.  These twin considerations\xe2\x80\x94historical practice and respect for state sovereignty\xe2\x80\x94counsel against extending <em>Apprendi</em> to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes.  P.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The historical record demonstrates that both in England before this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding and in the early American States, the common law generally entrusted the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses should be served consecutively or<font b="1"> concurrently to judges\xe2\x80\x99 unfettered discretion, assigning no role in the determination to the jury.  Thus, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Apprendi</em>.  There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused.  Instead, the defendant\xe2\x80\x94who historically may have faced consecutive sentences by default\xe2\x80\x94has been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.  Ice\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he is \xe2\x80\x9centitled\xe2\x80\x9d to concurrent sentences absent the factfindings Oregon law requires is rejected.  Because the scope of the federal constitutional jury right must be informed by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s historical common-law role, that right does not attach to every contemporary state-law \xe2\x80\x9centitlement\xe2\x80\x9d to predicate findings.  For similar reasons, <em>Cunningham</em>, upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control here.  In holding that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated \xe2\x80\x9cupper term\xe2\x80\x9d sentence for a particular crime fell within the jury\xe2\x80\x99s province rather than the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s, 549 U. S., at 274, <em>Cunningham</em> had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s traditional role was at stake.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of <em>Apprendi</em> that Ice requests.  This Court should not diminish the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign authority over the administration of their criminal justice systems absent impelling reason to do so.  Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the \xe2\x80\x9csalutary objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of promoting sentences proportionate to  \xe2\x80\x9cthe gravity of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U. S.<em>,</em> at 308, and of reducing disparities in sentence length.  All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  To hem in States by holding that they may not choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense.  Neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.  Further, the potential intrusion of <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule into other state initiatives on sentencing choices or accoutrements\xe2\x80\x94for example, permitting trial judges to find facts about the offense\xe2\x80\x99s nature or the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character in determining the length of supervised release, required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service, and the imposition of fines and restitution\xe2\x80\x94would cut the rule loose from its moorings.  Moreover, the expansion Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer, as the predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase, potentially necessitating bifurcated or trifurcated trials.

ICE<br/>\n555 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 07-901<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">OREGON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> THOMAS EUGENE ICE</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of oregon</p>\n<p align="left">[January 14, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the scope of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee, as construed in <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a> (2004).  Those decisions are rooted in the historic jury function\xe2\x80\x94determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  They hold that it is within the jury\xe2\x80\x99s province to determine any fact (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular offense.  Thus far, the Court has not extended the <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely</em> line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions.<em> </em>The question here presented concerns a sentencing function in which the jury traditionally played no part: When a defendant has been tried and convicted of multiple offenses, each involving discrete sentencing prescriptions, does the Sixth Amendment mandate jury determination of any fact declared necessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of concurrent, sentences?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most States continue the common-law tradition: They entrust to judges\xe2\x80\x99 unfettered discretion the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses shall be served consecutively or<font b="1"> concurrently.  In some States, sentences for multiple offenses are presumed to run consecutively, but sentencing judges may order concurrent sentences upon finding cause therefor.  Other States, including Oregon, constrain judges\xe2\x80\x99 discretion by requiring them to find certain facts before imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences.  It is undisputed that States may proceed on the first two tracks without transgressing the Sixth Amendment.  The sole issue in dispute, then, is whether the Sixth Amendment, as construed in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely</em>, precludes the mode of proceeding chosen by Oregon and several of her sister States.  We hold, in light of historical practice and the authority of States over administration of their criminal justice systems, that the Sixth Amendment does not exclude Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s choice. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State laws, as just observed, prescribe a variety of approaches to the decision whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentences for distinct offenses shall run concurrently or consecutively.  Oregon might have followed the prevailing pattern by placing the decision within the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in all,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] or almost all,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] circumstances.  Instead, Oregon and several other States have adopted a more restrained approach: they provide for judicial discretion, but constrain its exercise.  In these States, to impose consecutive sentences, judges must make certain predicate fact findings.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controlling statute in Oregon provides that sentences shall run concurrently unless the judge finds statutorily described facts.  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7137.123(1) (2007).  In most cases, finding such facts permits\xe2\x80\x94but does not require\xe2\x80\x94the judge to order consecutive sentences.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, an Oregon judge may order consecutive sentences \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7137.123(2).

An Oregon jury convicted Ice of six crimes.  For each of the two incidents, the jury found him guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s breasts.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At sentencing, the judge made findings, pursuant to \xc2\xa7137.123, that permitted the imposition of consecutive sentences.

These findings gave the judge discretion to impose the sentence for each of those sexual assault offenses consecutive to the associated burglary sentence.  The court elected to do so.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court ordered, however, that the sentences for touching the victim\xe2\x80\x99s breasts run concurrently with the other sentences.  <em>Ibid. </em> In total, the court sentenced Ice to 340 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.

Instead, the defendant\xe2\x80\x94who historically may have faced consecutive sentences by default\xe2\x80\x94has been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer that, as Ice argues, \xe2\x80\x9che was \xe2\x80\x98<em>entitled</em>\xe2\x80\x99 to\xe2\x80\x9d concurrent sentences absent the fact findings Oregon law requires.  Brief for Respondent 43.  In Ice\xe2\x80\x99s view, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Oregon Legislature deviated from tradition\xe2\x80\x9d and enacted a statute that hinges consecutive sentences on fact findings, <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule must be imported.  Brief for Respondent 33.  As we have described, the scope of the constitutional jury right must be informed by the historical role of the jury at common law.  See, <em>e.g., Williams</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/index.html">399 U. S. 78</a>, 98\xe2\x80\x93100 (1970).  It is therefore not the case that, as Ice suggests, the federal constitutional right attaches to every contemporary state-law \xe2\x80\x9centitlement\xe2\x80\x9d to predicate findings. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For similar reasons, <em>Cunningham</em>, upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control his case.  As stated earlier, we held in <em>Cunningham</em> that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated \xe2\x80\x9cupper term\xe2\x80\x9d sentence for a particular crime fell within the jury\xe2\x80\x99s province.  549 U. S., at 274 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The assignment of such a finding to the sentencing judge implicates <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s core concern: a legislative attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cremove from the [province of the] jury\xe2\x80\x9d the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense.  <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted).<font b="1">  We had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s traditional role was at stake.  <em>Cunningham </em>thus does not impede our conclusion that, as <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand, so too is the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on judge-found facts. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of <em>Apprendi</em> that Ice requests.  Beyond question, the authority of States over the administration of their criminal justice systems lies at the core of their sovereign status.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Patterson,</em> 432 U. S., at 201 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes without saying that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have long recognized the role of the States as laboratories for devising solutions to difficult legal problems.  See <em>New State Ice Co.</em> v. <em>Liebmann,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/262/index.html">285 U. S. 262</a>, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  This Court should not diminish that role absent impelling reason to do so.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears emphasis that state legislative innovations like Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s seek to rein in the discretion judges possessed at common law to impose consecutive sentences at will.  Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the \xe2\x80\x9csalutary objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of promoting sentences proportionate to \xe2\x80\x9cthe gravity of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Blakely, </em>542 U. S., at 308, and of reducing disparities in sentence length, see 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa726.3(f) (3d ed 2007).  All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  To hem in States by holding that they may not equally choose to make concurrent sentences\nthe rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense.  Neither <em>Apprendi</em> nor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, it is unclear how many other state initiatives would fall under Ice\xe2\x80\x99s proposed expansion of <em>Apprendi</em>.  As 17 States have observed in an <em>amici</em> brief supporting Oregon, States currently permit judges to make a variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration.  Trial judges often find facts about the nature of the offense or the character of the defendant in determining, for example, the length of supervised release following service of a prison sentence; required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service; and the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines and orders of restitution.  See Brief for State of Indiana et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11.  Intruding <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule into these decisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements surely would cut the rule loose from its moorings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the expansion that Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer.  The predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the guilt phase of a trial.  As a result, bifurcated or trifurcated trials might often prove necessary.  Brief for State of Indiana et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  We will not so burden the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trial courts absent any genuine affront to <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that not every state initiative will be in harmony with Sixth Amendment ideals.  But as we have previously emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cstructural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures from\xe2\x80\x9d pernicious manipulation of the rules we articulate.  <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U.

In any event, if confronted with such a manipulation, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would be required to question whether the [legislative measure] was constitutional under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 491, n. 16.

S. 466</a> (2000), is clear: Any fact\xe2\x80\x94other than that of a prior conviction\xe2\x80\x94that increases the maximum punishment to which a defendant may be sentenced must be admitted by the defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.  Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme allows judges rather than juries to find the facts necessary to commit defendants to longer prison sentences, and thus directly contradicts what we held eight years ago and have reaffirmed several times since.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s justification of Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s scheme is a virtual copy of the dissents in those cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge in this case could not have imposed a sentence of consecutive prison terms without making the factual finding that the defendant caused \xe2\x80\x9cseparate harms\xe2\x80\x9d to the victim by the acts that produced two convictions.  See 343 Ore. 248, 268, 170 P. 3d 1049, 1060 (2007) (Kistler, J., dissenting).  There can thus be no doubt that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding was \xe2\x80\x9cessential to\xe2\x80\x9d the punishment he imposed. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U.

S. 296</a>, 313 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the Court attempts to distinguish Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme by reasoning that the rule of <em>Apprendi</em> applies only to the length of a sentence for an individual crime and not to the total sentence for a defendant.  I cannot understand why we would make such a strange exception to the treasured right of trial by jury.  Neither the reasoning of the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases, nor any distinctive history of the factfinding necessary to imposition of consecutive sentences, nor (of course) logic supports such an odd rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have taken pains to reject artificial limitations upon the facts subject to the jury-trial guarantee.  We long ago made clear that the guarantee turns upon the penal consequences attached to the fact, and not to its formal definition as an element of the crime.  <em>Mullaney</em> v. <em>Wilbur</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/index.html">421 U. S. 684</a>, 698 (1975).  More recently, we rejected the contention that the \xe2\x80\x9caggravating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that qualify a defendant for the death penalty did not have to be found by the jury.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9ca State makes an increase in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\xe2\x80\x94no matter how the State labels it\xe2\x80\x94must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/584/index.html">536 U. S. 584</a>, 602 (2002).  A bare three years ago, in rejecting the contention that the facts determining application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines did not have to be found by the jury, we again set forth the pragmatic, practical, nonformalistic rule in terms that cannot be mistaken: The jury must \xe2\x80\x9cfind the existence of \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cany particular fact\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 that the law makes essential to [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 232 (quoting <em>Blakely</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 301).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This rule leaves no room for a formalistic distinction between facts bearing on the number of years of imprisonment that a defendant will serve for one count (subject to the rule of <em>Apprendi</em>) and facts bearing on how many years will be served in total (now not subject to <em>Apprendi</em>).  There is no doubt that consecutive sentences are a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater punishment\xe2\x80\x9d than concurrent sentences, <em>Apprendi</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 494.  We have hitherto taken note of the reality that \xe2\x80\x9ca concurrent sentence is traditionally imposed as a less<em> </em>severe sanction than a consecutive sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ralston</em> v. <em>Robinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/201/index.html">454 U. S. 201</a>, 216, n. 9 (1981) (emphasis deleted).  The decision to impose consecutive sentences alters the single consequence most important to convicted noncapital defendants: their date of release from prison.<font super="1">  For many defendants, the difference between consecutive and concurrent sentences is more important than a jury verdict of innocence on any single count: Two consecutive 10-year sentences are in most circumstances a more severe punishment than any number of concurrent 10-year sentences.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support its distinction-without-a-difference, the Court puts forward the same (the <em>very </em>same) arguments regarding the history of sentencing that were rejected by <em>Apprendi.  </em>Here, it is entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose either consecutive or concurrent sentences, <em>ante,</em> at 7; just as there it was entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose greater or lesser sentences (within the prescribed statutory maximum) for individual convictions.  There is no Sixth Amendment problem with a system that exposes defendants to a known range of sentences after a guilty verdict: \xe2\x80\x9cIn a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blakely</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 309.  The same analysis applies to a system where both consecutive and concurrent sentences are authorized after only a jury verdict of guilt; the burglar-rapist knows he is risking consecutive sentences.  Our concern here is precisely the same as our concern in <em>Apprendi:</em> What happens when a State breaks from the common-law practice of discretionary sentences and permits the imposition of an elevated sentence only upon the showing of extraordinary facts?  In such a system, the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>entitled </em>to\xe2\x80\x9d the lighter sentence \xe2\x80\x9cand by reason of the Sixth Amendment[,] the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at 309<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court protests that in this case there is no \xe2\x80\x9cencroachment\xe2\x80\x9d on or \xe2\x80\x9cerosion\xe2\x80\x9d of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role because traditionally it was for the judge to determine whether there would be concurrent terms.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Alas, this argument too was made and rejected in <em>Apprendi</em>.  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s role was not diminished, the <em>Apprendi </em>dissent contended, because it was traditionally up to judges, not juries, to determine what the sentence would be.  530 U. S., at 556, 559 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion acknowledged that in the 19th century it was the practice to leave sentencing up to the judges, within limits fixed by law.  But, it said, that practice had no bearing upon whether the jury must find the fact where a law conditions the higher sentence upon the fact.  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s role <em>is </em>diminished when the length of a sentence is made to depend upon a fact removed from its determination.  <em>Id</em>., at 482\xe2\x80\x93483.  The same is true here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court then observes that the results of the Oregon system could readily be achieved, instead, by a system in which consecutive sentences are the default rule<em> </em>but judges are permitted to impose concurrent sentences when they find certain facts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Undoubtedly the Sixth Amendment permits a system in which judges are authorized (or even required) to impose consecutive sentences unless the defendant proves additional facts to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction.  See <em>ibid</em>.  But the permissibility of that alternative means of achieving the same end obviously does not distinguish <em>Apprendi</em>,<em> </em>because the same argument (the <em>very </em>same argument) was raised and squarely rejected in that case:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone.  Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus absent from such a scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 491, n.\xc2\xa016. </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the Court abandons its effort to provide analytic support for its decision, and turns to what it thinks to be the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98salutary objectives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s scheme.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cLimiting judicial discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d we are told, promotes sentences proportionate to the gravity of the offense, and reduces disparities in sentence length.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The same argument (the <em>very </em>same argument) was made and rejected in <em>Booker</em>, see 543 U. S., at 244,<em> </em>and <em>Blakely</em>, see 542 U. S., at 313<em>.</em>  The protection of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of whether an alternative scheme is good policy, or whether the legislature had a compassionate heart in adopting it.  The right to trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a given, and <em>all</em> legislative policymaking\xe2\x80\x94good and bad, heartless and compassionate\xe2\x80\x94must work within the confines of that reality.  Of course the Court probably exaggerates the benign effect of Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, as is suggested by the defense bar\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous objection, evidenced by the participation of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>amicus</em> in favor of respondent.  Even that exaggeration is a replay of the rejected dissent<em> </em>in one of our prior cases.  There the Court responded: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard to believe that the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was somehow duped into arguing for the wrong side.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blakely, supra</em>, at 312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court summons up the parade of horribles assembled by the <em>amicus </em>brief of 17 States supporting Oregon.  It notes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]rial judges often find facts\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with \xe2\x80\x9ca variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration,\xe2\x80\x9d and worries that even their ability to set the length of supervised release, impose community service, or order entry into a drug rehabilitation program, may be called into question.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  But if these courses reduce rather than augment the punishment that the jury verdict imposes, there is no problem.  The last horrible the Court invokes is the prospect of bifurcated or even trifurcated trials in order to have the jury find the facts essential to consecutive sentencing without prejudicing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s merits case.  <em>Ibid</em>.  That is another <em>d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\x80 vu</em> and <em>d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\x80 rejet\xc3\xa9;</em> we have watched it parade past before, in several of our <em>Apprendi</em>-related opinions, and have not saluted.  See <em>Blakely</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (Breyer, J., dissenting); <em>Apprendi</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 557 (same).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s peroration says that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he jury-trial right is best honored through a \xe2\x80\x98principled rationale\xe2\x80\x99 that applies the rule of the <em>Apprendi </em>cases \xe2\x80\x98within the central sphere of their concern.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (quoting <em>Cunningham</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/270/index.html">549 U. S. 270</a>, 295 (2007) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)).  Undoubtedly so.  But we have hitherto considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe central sphere of their concern\xe2\x80\x9d to be facts necessary to the increase of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence beyond what the jury verdict alone justifies.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 290 (opinion of the Court).  If the doubling or tripling of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s jail time through fact-dependent consecutive sentencing does not meet this description, nothing does.  And as for a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled rationale\xe2\x80\x9d: The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon a distinction without a difference, and its repeated exhumation of arguments dead and buried by prior cases, seems to me the epitome of the opposite.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion muddies the waters, and gives cause to doubt whether the Court is willing to stand by <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee.</p>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></font></font></font></font></div>'
