As permitted by Supreme Court Rule 21(1), which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, the petitioners did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved in these cases. It is plain, therefore, that the Court, which has not requested the certification of those materials, has failed to discharge its admitted responsibility under Jenkins independently to review those materials under the second and third parts of the Miller obscenity test. Nor can it be assumed that the court below performed such a review, since that responsibility was not made clear until Jenkins. Petitioners have thus never been provided the independent judicial review to which the Court held them entitled in Jenkins. At a minimum, the Court should vacate the judgments below and remand for such a review. </p><p> Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#141">418 U.S. 87, 141</a>, 2919 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioners must be given an opportunity to have their cases decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which their convictions have ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgments below and remand for determinations whether petitioners should be afforded new trials under local community standards. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
