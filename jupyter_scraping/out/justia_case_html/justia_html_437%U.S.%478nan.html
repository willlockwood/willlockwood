JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the denial of a class certification could not be appealed immediately under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] as an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 437 U. S. 479</a></p><p> order refusing an injunction.  559 F.2d 209.  Because there is a conflict among the Circuits on the question whether \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1) authorizes such an appeal, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] we granted certiorari.  434 U.S. 984.  We affirm.</p>\n<p>Petitioner unsuccessfully applied for employment as a radio talk-show host at a station owned by respondent.  She then brought this civil rights action on behalf of herself and other females adversely affected by respondent\'s allege practice of discriminating against women.  The class she sought to represent included respondent\'s past, present, and future female employees; unsuccessful female applicants; females deterred by respondent\'s reputation from applying for employment; and females who will not in the future be considered for employment by respondent on account of their sex.  Her complaint prayed for equitable relief for the entire class. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner moved for a class certification pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court denied the motion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 437 U. S. 480</a></p><p> on the grounds that petitioner\'s claim was not typical, and that the case did not present questions of law or fact common to the class.  She immediately appealed, invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the relief that could be granted in favor of the class if she prevails would be broader than the relief that she may obtain as an individual.  The practical effect of the denial of class certification is, therefore, to refuse a substantial portion of the injunctive relief requested in the complaint.  Relying on our decision in <em>General Electric Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/430/case.html">287 U. S. 430</a></span>, petitioner then argues that this sort of effect on a request for injunctive relief establishes appealability under \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1).  We cannot agree; indeed, the argument misconceives both the scope of \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1) and the import of decisions such as <em>General Electric.</em></p>\n<p>The history of \xc2\xa7 1292(a)(1), which we reviewed in <em>Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/176/case.html">348 U. S. 176</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/176/case.html#178">348 U. S. 178</a></span>-181, need not be repeated.  It is sufficient to note that the statute creates an exception from the long-established policy against piecemeal appeals, which this Court is not authorized to enlarge or extend.  The exception is a narrow one, and is keyed to the "need to permit litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/176/case.html#181">348 U. S. 181</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The order denying class certification in this case did not have any such "irreparable" effect.  It could be reviewed both prior to and after final judgment; [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] it did not affect the merits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 437 U. S. 481</a></p><p> of petitioner\'s own claim; and it did not pass on the legal sufficiency of any claims for injunctive relief. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This stands in sharp contrast to the order in <em>General Electric.</em> [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In that case, the Court held that an order dismissing a counterclaim for an injunction was appealable.  The order, therefore, entirely disposed of the defendant\'s prayer for injunctive relief; here, the order merely limits the scope of the relief that may ultimately be granted.  While it may have a significant effect on the litigation, "[m]any interlocutory orders are equally important, . . . but they are not, for that reason, converted into injunctions."  <em>Morgantown v.

Westinghouse Electric Corp.,</em> 325 F.2d 822, 829 (CA2 1963) (Friendly, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>"Where the order is of the former type, the danger of serious harm from the court\'s erroneous belief in the existence of a legal barrier to its entertaining a claim for an injunction has been thought to outweigh the general undesirability of interlocutory appeals.  The very fact that the second type of order hinges on the trial court\'s discretion is itself an indication that such orders, relating primarily to convenience in litigation, carry a lesser threat of harm."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> .</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to <em>General Electric,</em> petitioner relies on <em>Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/379/case.html">293 U. S. 379</a></span>, and <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/188/case.html">317 U. S. 188</a></span>.  Both of those cases, however, rest on the distinction between "legal" and "equitable" claims, and supply no precedential weight for petitioner\'s argument.  Our characterization of those cases in <em>Morgantown v. Royal Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/254/case.html">337 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/254/case.html#258">337 U. S. 258</a></span>, is equally applicable here:</p>\n<p>"[D]istinctions from common law practice which supported our conclusions in the <em>Enelow</em> and <em>Ettelson</em> cases supply no analogy competent to make an injunction of what, in any ordinary understanding of the word, is not one."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Switzerland Cheese,</em> we held that an order denying a motion for summary judgment was not within \xc2\xa7 1292(a).  Inasmuch as the requested summary judgment would have included an injunction against trademark infringement, that order was, if anything, a more direct refusal of an injunction than the order denying class certification in this case.</p>\n<p>Of course, in one sense, the denial of class certification, like the denial of a summary judgment, does "touch on the merits," since a court must consider whether the complaint reveals common questions of law and fact, or whether there is a material issue of disputed fact.  But this determination does not otherwise reflect on the legal sufficiency of the claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
