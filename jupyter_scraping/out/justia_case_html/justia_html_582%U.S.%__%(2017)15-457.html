Although the death-knell theory likely \xe2\x80\x9cenhanced the quality of justice afforded a few litigants,\xe2\x80\x9d it did so at a heavy cost to \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x99s finality requirement.  <i>Id.</i>, at 473.<i> </i>First, the potential for multiple interlocutory appeals inhered in the doctrine.  See <i>id.,</i> at 474.  Second, the death-knell theory forced appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process, circumventing the two-tiered \xe2\x80\x9cscreening procedure\xe2\x80\x9d Congress established for interlocutory appeals in\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b).  <i>Id.</i>, at 474, 476.  Finally, the doctrine \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ed] only in favor of plaintiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the class-certification question may be critically important to defendants as well.  <i>Id.</i>, at 476.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Two decades later, in 1998, after Congress amended the Rules Enabling Act,\n\n28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72071 <i>et seq.</i>, to empower this Court to promulgate rules providing for interlocutory appeal of orders \xe2\x80\x9cnot otherwise provided for [in \xc2\xa71292],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71292(e), this Court approved Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f).  Rule 23(f) authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cpermissive interlocutory appeal\xe2\x80\x9d from adverse class-certification orders in \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole discretion of the court of appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 815.  This discretionary arrangement was the product of careful calibration on the part of the rulemakers.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents, owners of Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s videogame console, the Xbox 360, filed this putative class action alleging a design defect in the device.  The District Court struck respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class allegations from the complaint, and the Court of Appeals denied respondents permission to appeal that order under Rule 23(f).  Instead of pursuing their individual claims to final judgment on the merits, respondents stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of their claims with prejudice, but reserved the right to revive their claims should the Court of Appeals reverse the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s certification denial.  Respondents then appealed, challenging only the interlocutory order striking their class allegations.  The Ninth Circuit held it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under \xc2\xa71291.  It then held that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for striking respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class allegations was an impermissible one, but refused to opine on whether class certification was inappropriate for a different reason, leaving that question for the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71291 to review an order denying class certification (or, as here, an order striking class allegations) after the named plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Section 1291\xe2\x80\x99s final-judgment rule preserves the proper balance between trial and appellate courts, minimizes the harassment and delay that would result from repeated interlocutory appeals, and promotes the efficient administration of justice.  This Court has resisted efforts to stretch \xc2\xa71291 to permit appeals of right that would erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Mohawk Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenter</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 100\n.  Attempts to secure appeal as of right from adverse class certification orders fit that bill.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary-dismissal tactic, even more than the death-knell theory, invites protracted litigation and piecemeal appeals.  Under the death-knell doctrine, a court of appeals could decline to hear an appeal if it determined that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] adequate incentive to continue\xe2\x80\x9d despite the denial of class certification.  <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>,<i> </i>437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 471.  Under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory, however, the decision whether an immediate appeal will lie resides exclusively with the plaintiff, who need only dismiss her claims with prejudice in order to appeal the district court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying class certification.  And she may exercise that option more than once, interrupting district court proceedings with an interlocutory appeal again, should the court deny class certification on a different ground.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Respondents contend that their position promotes efficiency, observing that after dismissal with prejudice the case is over if the plaintiff loses on appeal.  But plaintiffs with weak merits claims may readily assume that risk, mindful that class certification often leads to a hefty settlement.  And the same argument was evident in the death-knell context, yet this Court determined that the potential for piecemeal litigation was \xe2\x80\x9capparent and serious.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 474.  That potential is greater still under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory, where plaintiffs alone determine whether and when to appeal an adverse certification ruling.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Also like the death-knell doctrine, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory allows indiscriminate appellate review of interlocutory orders.  Beyond disturbing the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appropriate relationship between the respective courts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 476, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 dismissal tactic undercuts<i> </i>Rule 23(f)\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary regime.  This consideration is \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f prime significance to the jurisdictional issue\xe2\x80\x9d in this case, <i>Swint</i> v. <i>Chambers County Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n514 U. S. 35\n, because Congress has established rulemaking as the means for determining when a decision is final for purposes of \xc2\xa71291 and for providing for appellate review of interlocutory orders not covered by statute, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72072(c) and 1292(e).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Respondents maintain that Rule 23(f) is irrelevant, for it concerns interlocutory orders, whereas this case involves an actual final judgment.  Yet permitting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary-dismissal tactic to yield an appeal of right would seriously undermine Rule 23(f)\xe2\x80\x99s careful calibration, as well as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 designation of rulemaking \xe2\x80\x9cas the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Mohawk Industries</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>, </i>at 113.  Plaintiffs in putative class actions cannot transform a tentative interlocutory order into a final judgment within the meaning of \xc2\xa71291 simply by dismissing their claims with prejudice.  Finality \xe2\x80\x9cis not a technical concept of temporal or physical termination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cobbledick</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323\n.  It is one \xe2\x80\x9cmeans [geared to] achieving a healthy legal system,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, and its contours are determined accordingly.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The one-sidedness of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary-dismissal device reinforces the conclusion that it does not support mandatory appellate jurisdiction of refusals to grant class certification.  The tactic permits only plaintiffs, never defendants, to force an immediate appeal of an adverse certification ruling.  Yet the \xe2\x80\x9cclass issue\xe2\x80\x9d may be just as important to defendants, <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>,<i> </i>437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 476, for class certification may force a defendant to settle rather than run the risk of ruinous liability.

We held unanimously that the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdeath-knell\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine did not warrant mandatory appellate jurisdiction of such \xe2\x80\x9cinherently interlocutory\xe2\x80\x9d orders.  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 470, 477.  Courts of Appeals employing the doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cregarded [their] jurisdiction as depending on whether [rejection of class-action status] had sounded the \xe2\x80\x98death knell\xe2\x80\x99 of the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 466.  These courts asked whether the refusal to certify a class would end a lawsuit for all practical purposes because the value of the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claims made it \xe2\x80\x9ceconomically imprudent to pursue his lawsuit to a final judgment and [only] then seek appellate review of [the] adverse class determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.  If, in the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, the order would terminate the litigation, the court deemed the order an appealable final decision under \xc2\xa71291.  <i>Id.,</i> at 471.  If, instead, the court determined that the plaintiff had \xe2\x80\x9cadequate incentive to continue [litigating], the order [was] considered interlocutory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Consequently, immediate appeal would be denied.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The death-knell theory likely \xe2\x80\x9cenhance[d] the quality of justice afforded a few litigants,\xe2\x80\x9d we recognized.  <i>Id.</i>, at 473.  But the theory did so, we observed, at a heavy cost to \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x99s finality requirement, and therefore to \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial system\xe2\x80\x99s overall capacity to administer justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 473; see <i>id.</i>, at 471 (Section 1291 \xe2\x80\x9cevinces a legislative judgment that \xe2\x80\x98restricting appellate review to final decisions prevents the debilitating effect on judicial administration caused by piecemeal appeal disposition.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Eisen</i> v. <i>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156,\n170 (1974)\n (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted))).  First, the potential for multiple interlocutory appeals inhered in the doctrine: When a ruling denying class certification on one ground was reversed on appeal, a death-knell plaintiff might again claim \xe2\x80\x9centitle[ment] to an appeal as a matter of right\xe2\x80\x9d if, on remand, the district court denied class certification on a different ground.  <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 474.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the doctrine forced appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process, thereby defeating a \xe2\x80\x9cvital purpose of the final-judgment rule\xe2\x80\x94that of maintaining the appropriate relationship between the respective courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 476 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>id.</i>, at 474.  The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b), we explained, had created a two-tiered \xe2\x80\x9cscreening procedure\xe2\x80\x9d to preserve this relationship and to restrict the availability of interlocutory review to \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 474.  For a party to obtain review under \xc2\xa71292(b), the district court must certify that the interlocutory order \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court of appeals may then, \xe2\x80\x9cin its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order.\xe2\x80\x9d  The death-knell doctrine, we stressed, \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvent[ed] [\xc2\xa71292(b)\xe2\x80\x99s] restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 475.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, we observed, the doctrine was one sided: It \xe2\x80\x9coperate[d] only in favor of plaintiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the class-certification question is often \xe2\x80\x9cof critical importance to defendants as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 476.  Just as a denial of class certification may sound the death knell for plaintiffs, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ertification of a large class may so increase the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s potential damages liability and litigation costs that he may find it economically prudent to settle and to abandon a meritorious defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In view of these concerns, the Court reached this conclusion in <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that an interlocutory order may induce a party to abandon his claim before final judgment is not a sufficient reason for considering [the order] a \xe2\x80\x98final decision\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of \xc2\xa71291.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 477.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">After <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>, a party seeking immediate review of an adverse class-certification order had no easy recourse.

The lawsuit is not the first of its kind.  A few years after petitioner Microsoft Corporation released its popular videogame console, the Xbox 360, a group of Xbox owners brought a putative class action against Microsoft based on an alleged design defect in the device.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re Microsoft Xbox 360 Scratched Disc Litigation</i>, 2009 WL 10219350, *1 (WD Wash., Oct. 5, 2009).  The named plaintiffs, advised by some of the same counsel representing respondents in this case, asserted that the Xbox scratched (and thus destroyed) game discs during normal game-playing conditions.  See<i> ibid.</i>  The District Court denied class certification, holding that individual issues of damages and causation predominated over common issues.  See <i>id.</i>, at *6\xe2\x80\x93*7.  The plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit under Rule 23(f) for leave to appeal the class-certification denial, but the Ninth Circuit denied the request.  See 851 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 1274, 1276 (WD Wash. 2012).  Thereafter, the <i>Scratched Disc </i>plaintiffs settled their claims individually.  851 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1276.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two years later, in 2011, respondents filed this lawsuit in the same Federal District Court.  They proposed a nationwide class of Xbox owners based on the same design defect alleged in <i>Scratched Disc Litigation</i>.  See<i> </i>851 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1275\xe2\x80\x931276.  The class-certification analysis in the earlier case did not control, respondents urged, because an intervening Ninth Circuit decision constituted a change in law sufficient to overcome the deference ordinarily due, as a matter of comity, the previous certification denial.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1277\xe2\x80\x931278.  The District Court disagreed.  Concluding that the relevant Circuit decision had not undermined <i>Scratched Disc Litigation</i>\xe2\x80\x99s causation analysis, the court determined that comity required adherence to the earlier certification denial and therefore struck respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class allegations.  851 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1280\xe2\x80\x931281.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Invoking Rule 23(f), respondents petitioned the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal that ruling.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Interlocu-tory review was appropriate in this case, they argued, be-cause the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order striking the class allegations created a \xe2\x80\x9cdeath-knell situation\xe2\x80\x9d: The \xe2\x80\x9csmall size of [their] claims ma[de] it economically irrational to bear the cost of litigating th[e] case to final judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d they asserted, so the order would \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively kil[l] the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Permission To Appeal Under Rule 23(f) in No. 12\xe2\x80\x9380085 (CA9), App. 118.

Whether a class should be certified, the court said, was a question for remand, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter addressed if and when [respondents] move[d] for class certification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict over this question: Do federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71291 and Article III of the Constitution to review an order denying class certification (or, as here, an order striking class allegations) after the named plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice?[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).  Because we hold that \xc2\xa71291 does not countenance jurisdiction by these means, we do not reach the constitutional question, and therefore do not address the arguments and analysis discussed in the opinion concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the very foundation of our judicial system,\xe2\x80\x9d the general rule has been that \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole case and every matter in controversy in it [must be] decided in a single appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McLish</i> v. <i>Roff</i>,\n\n141 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661\n\xe2\x80\x93666 (1891).  This final-judgment rule, now codified in \xc2\xa71291, preserves the proper balance between trial and appellate courts, minimizes the harassment and delay that would result from repeated interlocutory appeals, and promotes the efficient administration of justice.  See <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i> v. <i>Risjord</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 368,\n374 (1981)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Construing \xc2\xa71291 in line with these reasons for the rule, we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cfinality is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Eisen</i>, 417 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 171 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Repeatedly we have resisted efforts to stretch \xc2\xa71291 to permit appeals of right that would erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Mohawk Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenter</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 100,\n112 (2009)\n; <i>Digital Equipment Corp.</i> v. <i>Desktop Direct, Inc.</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 863\n\xe2\x80\x93879, 884 (1994); <i>Cobbledick</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323\n\xe2\x80\x93325, 330 (1940) (construing \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor statute).  Attempts to secure appeal as of right from adverse class-certification orders fit that bill.  See <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  Because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 dismissal device subverts the final-judgment rule and the process Congress has established for refining that rule and for determining when nonfinal orders may be immediately appealed, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72072(c) and 1292(e), the tactic does not give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71291.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary-dismissal tactic, even more than the death-knell theory, invites protracted litigation and piecemeal appeals.  Under the death-knell doctrine, a court of appeals could decline to hear an appeal if it determined that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] adequate incentive to continue\xe2\x80\x9d despite the denial of class certification.  <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i>,<i> </i>437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 471.  Appellate courts lack even that authority under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory.  Instead, the decision whether an immediate appeal will lie resides exclusively with the plaintiff; she need only dismiss her claims with prejudice, whereupon she may appeal the district court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying class certification.  And, as under the death-knell doctrine, she may exercise that option more than once, stopping and starting the district court proceedings with repeated interlocutory appeals.  See <i>id.</i>, at 474 (death-knell doctrine offered \xe2\x80\x9cno assurance that the trial process [would] not again be disrupted by interlocutory review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider this case.  The Ninth Circuit reviewed and rejected only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of comity as a basis for striking respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class allegations.  797 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 615.  The appeals court declined to reach Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments against class certification.  See <i>ibid.</i>  It remained open to the District Court, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, to deny class certification on a differ-ent ground, and respondents would be free, under their theory, to force appellate review of any new order denying certification by again dismissing their claims.  In designing Rule 23(f)\xe2\x80\x99s provision for discretionary review, the Rules Committee sought to prevent such disruption and delay.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents nevertheless maintain that their position promotes efficiency, observing that after dismissal with prejudice the case is over if the plaintiff loses on appeal.

Their way, they say, means prompt resolution of many lawsuits and infrequent use of the voluntary-dismissal tactic, for \xe2\x80\x9cmost appeals lose\xe2\x80\x9d and few plaintiffs will \xe2\x80\x9ctake th[e] risk\xe2\x80\x9d of losing their claims for good.  <i>Id.</i>, at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  Respondents overlook the prospect that plaintiffs with weak merits claims may readily assume that risk, mindful that class certification often leads to a hefty settlement.

Indeed, the same argument\xe2\x80\x94that the case was over if the plaintiff lost on appeal\xe2\x80\x94was evident in the death-knell context, yet this Court determined that the potential for piecemeal litigation was \xe2\x80\x9capparent and serious.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 474.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  And that potential is greater still under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory, where plaintiffs alone determine whether and when to appeal an adverse certification ruling.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Another vice respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory shares with the death-knell doctrine, both allow indiscriminate appellate review of interlocutory orders.  <i>Ibid</i>.

I therefore concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs in this case, respondents here, sued Microsoft, petitioner here, to recover damages after they purchased allegedly faulty video game consoles that Microsoft manufactured.  The plaintiffs brought claims for themselves (individual claims) and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated consumers (class allegations).  Early in the litigation, the District Court granted Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s motion to strike the class allegations, effectively declining to certify the class.  The Court of Appeals denied permission to appeal that decision under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which requires a party to obtain permission from the court of appeals before appealing a decision regarding class certification.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs decided not to pursue their individual claims, instead stipulating to a voluntary dismissal of those claims with prejudice.  They then filed a notice of appeal from the voluntary dismissal order.  On appeal, they did not ask the Court of Appeals to reverse the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of their individual claims.  They instead asked the Court of Appeals to reverse the order striking their class allegations.  The question presented in this case is whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under both \xc2\xa71291, which grants appellate jurisdiction to the courts of appeals over \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions\xe2\x80\x9d by district courts, and under Article III of the Constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court today holds that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71291 because the voluntary dismissal with prejudice did not result in a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  I dis-agree with that holding.  A decision is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71291 if it \xe2\x80\x9cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Catlin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229,\n233 (1945)\n.  The order here dismissed all of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims with prejudice and left nothing for the District Court to do but execute the judgment.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a (\xe2\x80\x9cdirect[ing] the Clerk to enter Judgment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and close th[e] case\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying not on the text of \xc2\xa71291 or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents about finality, but on Rule 23(f).  Rule 23(f) makes interlocutory orders regarding class certification appealable only with the permission of the court of appeals.  The Court concludes that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary dismissal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x98final decision\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because allowing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 appeal would \xe2\x80\x9csubvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f) put in place for immediate review of class-action orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 2.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion does not follow from its reasoning.  Whether a dismissal with prejudice is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d depends on the meaning of \xc2\xa71291, not Rule 23(f).  Rule 23(f) says nothing about finality, much less about the finality of an order dismissing individual claims with prejudice.  I agree with the Court that the plaintiffs are trying to avoid the requirements for interlocutory appeals under Rule 23(f), but our view of the balance struck in that rule should not warp our understanding of finality under \xc2\xa71291.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71291, I agree that the plaintiffs could not appeal in these circumstances.  In my view, they could not appeal because the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution.  The \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States extends only to \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72.

Put another way, \xe2\x80\x9cArticle III denies federal courts the power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them, and confines them to resolving real and substantial controversies admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Continental Bank Corp</i>.,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472,\n477 (1990)\n (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 appeal from their voluntary dismissal did not satisfy this jurisdictional requirement.  When the plaintiffs asked<i> </i>the District Court to dismiss their claims, they consented to the judgment against them and dis-avowed any right to relief from Microsoft.  The parties thus were no longer adverse to each other on any claims, and the Court of Appeals could not \xe2\x80\x9caffect the[ir] rights\xe2\x80\x9d in any legally cognizable manner.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Indeed, it has long been the rule that a party may not appeal from the voluntary dismissal of a claim, since the party consented to the judgment against it.  See, <i>e.g., Evans</i> v. <i>Phillips</i>, 4 Wheat. 73 (1819); <i>Lord </i>v. <i>Veazie</i>, 8 How. 251, 255\xe2\x80\x93256 (1850); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Babbitt</i>,\n\n104 U.\xc2\xa0S. 767 (1882)\n; <i>Deakins</i> v. <i>Monaghan</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193\n\xe2\x80\x93200 (1988).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs contend that their interest in reversing the order striking their class allegations is sufficient to satisfy Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement, but they misunderstand the status of putative class actions.  Class allegations, without an underlying individual claim, do not give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those allegations are simply the means of invoking a procedural mechanism that enables a plaintiff to litigate his individual claims on behalf of a class.
