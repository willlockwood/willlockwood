He claims that he lost most of his investment when the share price plummeted after petitioners, Merrill Lynch and other financial institutions (collectively, Merrill Lynch), devalued Escala through \xe2\x80\x9cnaked short sales\xe2\x80\x9d of its stock.  Unlike a typical short sale, where a person borrows stock from a broker, sells it to a buyer on the open market, and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker, the seller in a \xe2\x80\x9cnaked\xe2\x80\x9d short sale does not borrow the stock he puts on the market, and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer.  This practice, which can injure shareholders by driving down a stock\xe2\x80\x99s price, is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Regulation SHO, which prohibits short-sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities, thereby curbing market manipulation.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Manning and other former Escala shareholders (collectively, Manning) filed suit in New Jersey state court, alleging that Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated New Jersey law.  Though Manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules, his complaint referred explicitly to Regulation SHO, cataloguing past accusations against Merrill Lynch for flouting its requirements and suggesting that the transactions at issue had again violated the regulation.  Merrill Lynch removed the case to Federal District Court, asserting federal jurisdiction on two grounds.  First, it invoked the general federal question statute,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331, which grants district courts jurisdiction of \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions arising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.  It also invoked \xc2\xa727 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), which grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cof all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules or regulations thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa(a).  Manning moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his state-law claims.  The District Court denied his motion, but the Third Circuit reversed.  The court first decided that \xc2\xa71331 did not confer jurisdiction, because Manning\xe2\x80\x99s claims all arose under state law and did not necessarily raise any federal issues.  Nor was the District Court the appropriate forum under \xc2\xa727 of the Exchange Act, which, the court held, covers only those cases that would satisfy \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d test for general federal jurisdiction.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The jurisdictional test established by \xc2\xa727 is the same as \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s test for deciding if a case \xe2\x80\x9carises under\xe2\x80\x9d a federal law.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Section 27\xe2\x80\x99s text more readily supports this meaning than it does the parties\xe2\x80\x99 two alternatives.  Merrill Lynch argues that \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s plain language requires an expansive rule: Any suit that either explicitly or implicitly asserts a breach of an Exchange Act duty is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d that duty even if the plaintiff seeks relief solely under state law.  Under the natural reading of that text, however, \xc2\xa727 confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.  The \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language thus stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the Exchange Act.  Meanwhile, Manning\xe2\x80\x99s far more restrictive interpretation\xe2\x80\x94that a suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d only if it is brought directly under that statute\xe2\x80\x94veers too far in the opposite direction.  Instead, \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s language is best read to capture both suits brought under the Exchange Act and the rare suit in which a state-law claim rises and falls on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prove the violation of a federal duty.  An existing jurisdictional test well captures both of these classes of suits \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d such a duty:\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s provision of federal jurisdiction of all civil actions \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.

Between 2006 and 2007, Escala\xe2\x80\x99s share price plummeted and Manning lost most of his investment.  Manning blames petitioners, Merrill Lynch and several other financial institutions (collectively, Merrill Lynch), for devaluing Escala during that period through \xe2\x80\x9cnaked short sales\xe2\x80\x9d of its stock.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A typical short sale of a security is one made by a borrower, rather than an owner, of stock.  In such a transaction, a person borrows stock from a broker, sells it to a buyer on the open market, and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker.  The short seller\xe2\x80\x99s hope is that the stock price will decline between the time he sells the borrowed shares and the time he buys replacements to pay back his loan.  If that happens, the seller gets to pocket the difference (minus associated transaction costs).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a \xe2\x80\x9cnaked\xe2\x80\x9d short sale, by contrast, the seller has not borrowed (or otherwise obtained) the stock he puts on the market, and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer.

The SEC regulates such short sales at the federal level: The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Regulation SHO, issued under the Exchange Act, prohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities and thereby curbs market manipulation.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb639.  That conduct, Manning charges, contravened provisions of the New Jersey RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), New Jersey Criminal Code, and New Jersey Uniform Securities Law; it also, he adds, ran afoul of the New Jersey common law of negligence, unjust enrichment, and interference with contractual relations.  See <i>id.</i>, at 82a\xe2\x80\x93101a, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb688\xe2\x80\x93161.  Manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules.  His complaint, however, referred explicitly to Regulation SHO, both describing the purposes of that rule and cataloguing past accusations against Merrill Lynch for flouting its requirements.

See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441 (allowing removal of any civil action of which federal district courts have original jurisdiction).  Merrill Lynch asserted federal jurisdiction on two grounds.  First, it invoked the general federal question statute, \xc2\xa71331, which grants district courts jurisdiction of \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions arising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.  Second, it maintained that the suit belonged in federal court by virtue of \xc2\xa727 of the Exchange Act.  That provision, in relevant part, grants district courts exclusive jurisdiction of \xe2\x80\x9call suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa(a).  Manning moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his collection of state-law claims.  The District Court denied his motion.  See No. 12\xe2\x80\x934466 (D NJ, Mar. 18, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a\xe2\x80\x9338a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, ordering a remand of the case to state court.  See 772 F.\xc2\xa03d 158 (2014).  The Third Circuit first decided that the fed-eral question statute,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331, did not confer juris-diction of the suit, because all Manning\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbrought under state law\xe2\x80\x9d and none \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily raised\xe2\x80\x9d a federal issue.  772 F.\xc2\xa03d<i>,</i> at 161, 163.  Nor, the court held, did \xc2\xa727 of the Exchange Act make the district court the appropriate forum.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a nearly identical jurisdictional provision, the Court of Appeals found that \xc2\xa727 covers only those cases involving the Exchange Act that would satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d test of the federal question statute.  See <i>id.,</i> at 166\xe2\x80\x93167 (citing <i>Pan American Petroleum Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty.</i>,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656 (1961)\n).  Because the District Court lacked jurisdiction of Manning\xe2\x80\x99s suit under \xc2\xa71331, so too it was not the exclusive forum under \xc2\xa727.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Merrill Lynch sought this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review solely as to whether \xc2\xa727 commits Manning\xe2\x80\x99s case to federal court.

We now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Like the Third Circuit, we read \xc2\xa727 as conferring exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same suits as \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] under\xe2\x80\x9d the Exchange Act pursuant to the general federal question statute.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  The text of \xc2\xa727 more readily supports that meaning than it does either of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 two alternatives.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents interpreting identical statutory language positively compel that conclusion.  And the construction fits with our practice of reading jurisdictional laws, so long as consistent with their language, to respect the traditional role of state courts in our federal system and to establish clear and administrable rules.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 27, as noted earlier, provides federal district courts with exclusive jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cof all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa(a); see <i>supra,</i> at 3.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Much the same wording appears in nine other federal jurisdictional provisions\xe2\x80\x94mostly enacted, like \xc2\xa727, as part of New Deal-era regulatory statutes.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Merrill Lynch argues that the \xe2\x80\x9cplain, unambiguous language\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa727 requires an expansive understanding of its scope.  Brief for Petitioners 23.  Whenever (says Merrill Lynch) a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint either explicitly or implic-itly \xe2\x80\x9cassert[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant breached an Exchange Act duty,\xe2\x80\x9d then the suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d that duty and a federal court has exclusive jurisdiction.  <i>Id.</i>, at 22; Reply Brief 10\xe2\x80\x9311; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\xe2\x80\x938 (confirming that such allegations need not be express).  That is so, Merrill Lynch contends, even if the plaintiff, as in this case, brings only state-law claims in his complaint\xe2\x80\x94that is, seeks relief solely under state law.  See Reply Brief 3\xe2\x80\x936.  And it is so, Merrill Lynch continues, even if the plaintiff can prevail on those claims without proving that the alleged breach of an Exchange Act duty\xe2\x80\x94here, the violation of Regulation SHO\xe2\x80\x94actually occurred.  See <i>id.,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x9313; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he words \xe2\x80\x98brought to enforce\xe2\x80\x99 [donot focus] on what the court would necessarily have to decide\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But a natural reading of \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s text does not extend so far.  \xe2\x80\x9cBrought\xe2\x80\x9d in this context means \xe2\x80\x9ccommenced,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law  Dictionary 254 (3d ed. 1933); <i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>to\xe2\x80\x9d is a word \xe2\x80\x9cexpressing purpose [or] consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d The Concise Oxford Dictionary 1288 (1931); and \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cgive force [or] effect to,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1927).  So \xc2\xa727 confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.  That language, in emphasizing what the suit is designed to accomplish, stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the Exchange Act.  Consider, for example, a simple state-law action for breach of contract, in which the plaintiff alleges, for atmospheric reasons, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct also violated the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x94or still less, that the defendant is a bad actor who infringed that statute on another occasion.  On Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa727 would cover that suit; indeed, Merrill Lynch points to just such incidental assertions as the basis for federal jurisdiction here.  See Brief for Petitioners 20\xe2\x80\x9321; <i>supra,</i> at 3.  But that hypothetical suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d state contract law, not the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x94because the plaintiff can get all the relief he seeks just by showing the breach of an agreement, without proving any violation of federal securities law.  The suit, that is, can achieve all it is supposed to even if issues involving the Exchange Act never come up.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Critiquing Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s position on similar grounds, Manning proposes a far more restrictive interpretation of \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s language\xe2\x80\x94one going beyond what he needs to prevail.  See Brief for Respondents 27\xe2\x80\x9333.  According to Manning, a suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s duties or liabilities only if it is brought directly under that statute\xe2\x80\x94that is, only if the claims it asserts (and not just the duties it means to vindicate) are created by the Exchange Act.  On that view, everything depends (as Justice Holmes famously said in another jurisdictional context) on which law \xe2\x80\x9ccreates the cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Well Works Co.</i> v. <i>Layne &amp; Bowler Co.</i>,\n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 257,\n260 (1916)\n.  If a complaint asserts a right of action deriving from the Exchange Act (or an associated regulation), the suit must proceed in federal court.  But if, as here, the complaint brings only state-created claims, then the case belongs in a state forum.  And that is so, Manning claims, even if\xe2\x80\x94contrary to what the Third Circuit held below\xe2\x80\x94the success of the state claim necessarily hinges on proving that the defendant breached an Exchange Act duty.  See Brief for Respondents 31.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Manning\xe2\x80\x99s view of the text\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, although better than Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s, veers too far in the opposite direction.  There is no doubt, as Manning says, that a suit asserting an Exchange Act cause of action fits within \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s scope: Bringing such a suit is the prototypical way of enforcing an Exchange Act duty.  But it is not the only way.  On rare occasions, as just suggested, a suit raising a state-law claim rises or falls on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prove the violation of a federal duty.  See, <i>e.g., Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc.</i> v. <i>Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg.</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n\xe2\x80\x93315 (2005); <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.,</i>\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180,\n201 (1921)\n.  If in that manner, a state-law action necessarily depends on a showing that the defendant breached the Exchange Act, then that suit could also fall within \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  Suppose, for example, that a state statute simply makes illegal \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of the Exchange Act involving naked short selling.\xe2\x80\x9d  A plaintiff seeking relief under that state law must undertake to prove, as the cornerstone of his suit, that the defendant infringed a requirement of the federal statute.  (Indeed, in this hypothetical, that is the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s <i>only</i> project.)  Accordingly, his suit, even though asserting a state-created claim, is also \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d a duty created by the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An existing jurisdictional test well captures both classes of suits \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d such a duty.  As noted earlier,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 provides federal jurisdiction of all civil actions \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  This Court has found that statutory term satisfied in either of two circumstances.  Most directly, and most often, federal jurisdiction attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted.  That set of cases is what Manning highlights in offering his view of \xc2\xa727.  But even when \xe2\x80\x9ca claim finds its origins\xe2\x80\x9d in state law, there is \xe2\x80\x9ca special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gunn</i> v. <i>Minton</i>, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As this Court has explained, a federal court has jurisdiction of a state-law claim if it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance\xe2\x80\x9d of federal and state power.  <i>Grable</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314; see <i>Gunn</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (framing the same standard as a four-part test).  That description typically fits cases, like those described just above, in which a state-law cause of action is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d a duty created by the Exchange Act because the claim\xe2\x80\x99s very success depends on giving effect to a federal requirement.  Accordingly, we agree with the court below that \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional test matches the one we have formulated for \xc2\xa71331, as applied to cases involving the Exchange Act.  If (but only if) such a case meets the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standard, \xc2\xa727 commands that it go to federal court.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Merrill Lynch objects that our rule construes \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely different language\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>the phrases \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9dand \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71331 and \xc2\xa727, respectively\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto mean exactly the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 7.  We cannot deny that point.  But we think it far less odd than Merrill Lynch does.  After all, the test for \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction is not grounded in that provision\xe2\x80\x99s particular phrasing.  This Court has long read the words \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in Article III to extend quite broadly, \xe2\x80\x9cto all cases in which a federal question is \xe2\x80\x98an ingredient\xe2\x80\x99 of the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 804\n (1986) (quoting <i>Osborn</i> v. <i>Bank of United States,</i> 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824)).  In the statutory context, however, we opted to give those same words a narrower scope \xe2\x80\x9cin the light of [\xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s] history[,] the demands of reason and coherence, and the dictates of sound judicial policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romero</i> v. <i>International Terminal Operating Co.</i>,\n\n358 U.\xc2\xa0S. 354,\n379 (1959)\n.  Because the resulting test does not turn on \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s text, there is nothing remarkable in its fitting as, or even more, neatly a differently worded statutory provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor can Merrill Lynch claim that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the new \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language in \xc2\xa727 shows an intent to depart from a settled (even if linguistically ungrounded) test for statutory \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  That is because no such well-defined test then existed.  As we recently noted, our caselaw construing \xc2\xa71331 was for many decades\xe2\x80\x94including when the Exchange Act passed\xe2\x80\x94highly \xe2\x80\x9cunruly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gunn</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at __ (slip op., at 6) (referring to the \xe2\x80\x9ccanvas\xe2\x80\x9d of our old opinions as \xe2\x80\x9clook[ing] like one that Jackson Pollock got to first\xe2\x80\x9d).  Against that muddled backdrop, it is impossible to infer that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa727, wished to depart from what we now understand as the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standard.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This Court has reached the same conclusion before.  In two unrelated decisions, we addressed the \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language at issue here.  See <i>Pan American</i>,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656\n; <i>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</i> v. <i>Epstein</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367 (1996)\n.  Each time, we viewed that phrase as coextensive with our construction of \xe2\x80\x9carising under.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Pan American</i> involved \xc2\xa722 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA),\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7717u\xe2\x80\x94an exclusive jurisdiction provision containing language materially indistinguishable from \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The case began in state court when a natural gas purchaser sued a producer for breach of a contract setting sale prices.  Prior to the alleged breach, the producer had filed those contractual rates with the Federal Power Commission, as the NGA required.  Relying on that submission (which the complaint did not mention), the producer claimed that the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s suit was \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d a liability deriving from the NGA\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>a filed rate\xe2\x80\x94and so must proceed in federal court.  See 366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 662.  This Court rejected the argument.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision explained that \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9carising under,\xe2\x80\x9d made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis.  The inquiry, we wrote, was \xe2\x80\x9cnot affected by want\xe2\x80\x9d of the language contained in the federal question statute.  <i>Id.,</i> at 665, n.\xc2\xa02.  The \xe2\x80\x9climitation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d associated with \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, we continued, were \xe2\x80\x9cclearly implied\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x99s alternative phrasing.  <i>Ibid.  </i>In short, the linguistic distinction between the two jurisdictional provisions did not extend to their meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Pan American</i> thus went on to analyze the jurisdictional issue in the manner set out in our \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d precedents.  Federal question jurisdiction lies, the Court wrote, only if \xe2\x80\x9cit appears from the face of the complaint that determination of the suit depends upon a question of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 663.  That inquiry focuses on \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular claims a suitor makes\xe2\x80\x9d in his complaint\xe2\x80\x94meaning, whether the plaintiff seeks relief under state or federal law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 662.  In addition, the Court suggested, a federal court could adjudicate a suit stating only a state-law claim if it included as \xe2\x80\x9can element, and an essential one,\xe2\x80\x9d the violation of a federal right.  <i>Id.</i>, at 663 (quoting <i>Gully</i> v. <i>First Nat. Bank in Meridian</i>,\n\n299 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109,\n112 (1936)\n).  With those principles of \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction laid out, the Court held that \xc2\xa722 did not enable a federal court to resolve the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s case, because he could prevail merely by proving breach of the contract.  See 366 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 663\xe2\x80\x93665.  <i>Pan American</i> establishes, then, that an action \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d a duty or liability created by a federal statute is nothing more (and nothing less) than an action \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d that law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Merrill Lynch reads <i>Pan American </i>more narrowly, as holding only that \xc2\xa722 does not confer federal jurisdiction when a complaint (unlike Manning\xe2\x80\x99s) fails to reference federal law at all.  See Brief for Petitioners 32\xe2\x80\x9333, 38.  But that argument ignores <i>Pan American</i>\xe2\x80\x99s express statement of equivalence between \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s language and the federal question statute\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cBrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d has the same \xe2\x80\x9climitation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning, the same scope) as \xe2\x80\x9carising under.\xe2\x80\x9d  366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 665, n.\xc2\xa02.  And just as important, Merrill Lynch disregards <i>Pan American</i>\xe2\x80\x99s analytical structure: The decision proceeds by reviewing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d precedents, articulating the principles animating that caselaw, and then applying those tenets to the dispute at hand.  <i>Id.,</i> at 662\xe2\x80\x93665.  The Court thus showed (as well as told) that \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction mirrors that of \xe2\x80\x9carising under.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a fallback, Merrill Lynch claims that <i>Pan American </i>is irrelevant here because it relied on legislative history distinct to the NGA in finding \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language coterminous with \xe2\x80\x9carising under.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Petitioners 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  The premise of that argument is true enough: In support of its holding, the Court quoted a Committee Report describing \xc2\xa722 as conferring federal jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cover cases arising under the act.\xe2\x80\x9d  366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 665, n.\xc2\xa02.  But we cannot accept the conclusion Merrill Lynch draws from that statement: that courts should give two identically worded statutory provisions, passed less than five years apart, markedly different meanings.  Indeed, the result of Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s approach is still odder, for what of the eight other jurisdictional provisions containing \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language?  See n.\xc2\xa03, <i>supra</i>.  Presumably, Merrill Lynch would have courts inspect each of their legislative histories to decide whether to read those statutes as reproducing the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standard, adopting Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s alternative view, or demanding yet another jurisdictional test.  We are hard pressed to imagine a less sensible way of construing the repeated iterations of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d in the jurisdictional provisions of the Federal Code.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, this Court in <i>Matsushita </i>addressed \xc2\xa727 itself, and once again equated the \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standards.  That decision<i> </i>arose from a state-law action against corporate directors for breach of fiduciary duty.  The issue was whether the state court handling the suit could approve a settlement releasing, in addition to the state claims actually brought, potential Exchange Act claims that \xc2\xa727 would have committed to federal court.  In deciding that the state court could do so, we described \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x94not once, not twice, but three times\xe2\x80\x94as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the Exchange Act.  See 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 380 (Section 27 \xe2\x80\x9cconfers exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts for suits <i>arising under</i> the [Exchange] Act\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 381 (Section 27 \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits state courts from adjudicating claims <i>arising under </i>the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 385 (Section 27 \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] state courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits <i>arising under </i>the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphases added).  Over and over, then, the Court took as a given that \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional test mimicked the one in the general federal question statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And still more: The <i>Matsushita </i>Court thought clear that the suit as filed\xe2\x80\x94which closely resembled Manning\xe2\x80\x99s in its mix of state and federal law\xe2\x80\x94fell outside \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s grant of exclusive jurisdiction.  As just noted, the claims brought in the <i>Matsushita</i> complaint sought relief for breach of a state-law duty.  But in support of those claims, the plaintiffs charged, much as Manning did here, that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct also violated federal securities laws.  See 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 370; <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  We found the presence of that accusation insufficient to trigger \xc2\xa727.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he cause pleaded,\xe2\x80\x9d we wrote, remained \xe2\x80\x9ca state common-law action,\xe2\x80\x9d 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 382, n.\xc2\xa07: Notwithstanding the potential federal issue, the suit \xe2\x80\x9cwas not \xe2\x80\x98brought to enforce\xe2\x80\x99 any rights or obligations under the [Exchange] Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 381.  The Court thus rejected the very position Merrill Lynch takes here\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, that \xc2\xa727 precludes a state court from adjudicating any case, even if brought under state law, in which the plaintiff asserts an Exchange Act breach.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Construing \xc2\xa727, consistent with both text and precedent, to cover suits that arise under the Exchange Act serves the goals we have consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes.  Our reading, unlike Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s, gives due deference to the important role of state courts in our federal system.  And the standard we adopt is more straightforward and administrable than the alternative Merrill Lynch offers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Out of respect for state courts, this Court has time and again declined to construe federal jurisdictional statutes more expansively than their language, most fairly read, requires.  We have reiterated the need to give \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard [to] the rightful independence of state governments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and more particularly, to the power of the States \xe2\x80\x9cto provide for the determination of controversies in their courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romero</i>, 358 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 380 (quoting <i>Healy</i> v. <i>Ratta</i>,\n\n292 U.\xc2\xa0S. 263,\n270 (1934)\n; <i>Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp.</i> v. <i>Sheets</i>,\n\n313 U.\xc2\xa0S. 100,\n109 (1941)\n.  Our decisions, as we once put the point, reflect a \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply felt and traditional reluctance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to expand the jurisdiction of federal courts through a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romero</i>, 358 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 379.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  That interpretive stance serves, among other things, to keep state-law actions like Manning\xe2\x80\x99s in state court, and thus to help maintainthe constitutional balance between state and federaljudiciaries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern for state court prerogatives disappear, as Merrill Lynch suggests it should, in the face of a statute granting exclusive federal jurisdiction.  See Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9327.  To the contrary, when a statute mandates, rather than permits, federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94thus depriving state courts of all ability to adjudicate certain claims\xe2\x80\x94our reluctance to endorse \xe2\x80\x9cbroad reading[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Romero</i>, 358 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 379, if anything, grows stronger.  And that is especially so when, as here, the construction offered would place in federal court actions bringing only claims created by state law\xe2\x80\x94even if those claims might raise federal issues.  To be sure, a grant of exclusive federal jurisdiction, as Merrill Lynch reminds us, indicates that Congress wanted \xe2\x80\x9cgreater uniformity of construction and more effective and expert application\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law than usual.  Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting <i>Matsushita, </i>516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 383).  But \xe2\x80\x9cgreater\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmore\xe2\x80\x9d do not mean \xe2\x80\x9ctotal,\xe2\x80\x9d and the critical question remains how far such a grant extends.  In resolving that issue, we will not lightly read the statute to alter the usual constitu-tional balance, as it would by sending actions with all state-law claims to federal court just because a complaint references a federal duty.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our precedents construing other exclusive grants of federal jurisdiction illustrate those principles.  In <i>Pan American</i>, for example, we denied that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of state-law claims potentially implicating the NGA\xe2\x80\x99s meaning would \xe2\x80\x9cjeopardize the uniform system of regulation\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute established.  366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 665.  We reasoned that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to review state court decisions of federal questions would sufficiently protect federal interests.  And similarly, in <i>Tafflin</i> v. <i>Levitt</i>,\n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 455\n\xe2\x80\x93467 (1990), we permitted state courts to adjudicate civil RICO actions that might raise issues about the scope of federal crimes alleged as predicate acts, even though federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cof all offenses against the laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73231.  There, we expressed confidence that state courts would look to federal court interpretations of the relevant criminal statutes.  Accordingly, we saw \xe2\x80\x9cno significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law\xe2\x80\x9d and no \xe2\x80\x9cincompatibility with federal interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tafflin,</i> 493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 464\xe2\x80\x93465, 467 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So too here, when state courts, in deciding state-law claims, address possible issues of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Not even Merrill Lynch thinks those decisions wholly avoidable: It admits that \xc2\xa727 does nothing to prevent state courts from resolving Exchange Act questions that result from defenses or counterclaims.  See Brief for Petitioners 32\xe2\x80\x9333; <i>Pan American, </i>366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664\xe2\x80\x93665.  We see little difference, in terms of the uniformity-based policies Merrill Lynch invokes, if those issues instead appear in a complaint like Manning\xe2\x80\x99s.  And indeed, Congress likely contemplated that some complaints intermingling state and federal questions would be brought in state court: After all, Congress specifically affirmed the capacity of such courts to hear state-law securities actions, which predictably raise issues coinciding, overlapping, or intersecting with those under the Act itself.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778bb(a)(2); <i>Matsushita</i>, 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 383. <i> </i>So, for example, it is hardly surprising in a suit like this one, alleging short sales in violation of <i>state </i>securities law, that a plaintiff might say the defendant previously breached a <i>federal</i> prohibition of similar conduct.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (describing Manning\xe2\x80\x99s complaint).  And it is less troubling for a state court to consider such an issue than to lose all ability to adjudicate a suit raising only state-law causes of action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reading \xc2\xa727 in line with our \xc2\xa71331 caselaw also promotes \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative simplicity[, which] is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hertz Corp.</i> v. <i>Friend</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77,\n94 (2010)\n.  Both judges and litigants are familiar with the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standard and how it works.  For the most part, that test provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions.  And an existing body of precedent gives guidance whenever borderline cases crop up.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  By contrast, no one has experience with Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s alternative standard, which would spring out of nothing to govern suits involving not only the Exchange Act but up to nine other discrete spheres of federal law.  See n.\xc2\xa03, <i>supra </i>(listing statutes with \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language); <i>supra,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (noting Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s backup claim that legislative histories might compel different tests for different statutes).  Adopting such an untested approach, and forcing courts to toggle back and forth between it and the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d standard, would undermine consistency and predictability in litigation.  That result disserves courts and parties alike.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Making matters worse, Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s rule is simple for plaintiffs to avoid\xe2\x80\x94or else, excruciating for courts to police.  Under that rule, a plaintiff electing to bring state-law claims in state court will purge his complaint of any references to federal securities law, so as to escape re-moval.  Such omissions, after all, will do nothing to change the way the plaintiff can present his case at trial; they will merely make the complaint less informative.  Recognizing the potential for that kind of avoidance, Merrill Lynch argues that a judge should go behind the face of a complaint to determine whether it is the product of \xe2\x80\x9cartful pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (If the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9chad just literally whited out, deleted the references to Reg[ulation] SHO,\xe2\x80\x9d the court should still understand the complaint to allege a breach of that rule; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact [that the plaintiffs] didn\xe2\x80\x99t cite it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have no idea how a court would make that judgment, and get cold comfort from Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that the question would arise not in this case but in \xe2\x80\x9cthe next third, fourth, fifth case down the road.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 8.  Jurisdictional tests are built for more than a single dispute: That Merrill Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s threatens to become either a useless drafting rule or a tortuous inquiry into artful pleading is one more good reason to reject it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 27 provides exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same class of cases as \xe2\x80\x9carise under\xe2\x80\x9d the Exchange Act for purposes of \xc2\xa71331.  The text of \xc2\xa727, most naturally read, supports that rule.  This Court has adopted the same view in two prior cases.  And that reading of the statute promotes the twin goals, important in interpreting jurisdictional grants, of respecting state courts and providing administrable standards.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our holding requires remanding Manning\xe2\x80\x99s suit to state court.  The Third Circuit found that the District Court did not have jurisdiction of Manning\xe2\x80\x99s suit under \xc2\xa71331 because all his claims sought relief under state law and none necessarily raised a federal issue.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  Merrill Lynch did not challenge that ruling, and we therefore take it as a given.  And that means, under our decision today, that the District Court also lacked jurisdiction under \xc2\xa727.

See <i>post, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Thomas,\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  In other words, the concurrence would not ask, as the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d test does, whether the federal issue embedded in such a state-law claim is also substantial, actually disputed, and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the congressionally approved federal-state balance.

But this Court has not construed any jurisdictional statute, whether using the words \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d (or for that matter, any other), to draw the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s line.  For as long as we have contemplated exercising federal jurisdiction over state-law claims necessarily raising federal issues, we have inquired as well into whether those issues are \xe2\x80\x9creally and substantially\xe2\x80\x9d disputed.  See, <i>e.g., Hop-kins </i>v.<i> Walker, </i>\n\n244 U.\xc2\xa0S. 486,\n489 (1917)\n; <i>Shulthis </i>v.<i> McDougal,</i>\n\n225 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,\n569 (1912)\n.

I agree that this suit belongs in state court, but I would rest that conclusion on the statute before us, \xc2\xa727 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa.  That statute does not use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d or provide a sound basis for adopting the arising-under standard.  It instead provides federal jurisdiction where a suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d Exchange Act requirements.  \xc2\xa778aa(a).  That language establishes a straightforward test: If a complaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the Act, \xc2\xa727 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit.  Because the complaint here does not allege such claims\xe2\x80\x94and because no other statute confers federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94this suit should return to state court.  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 27 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall have exclusive jurisdiction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778aa(a).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*  As the Court explains, under a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural reading,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa727 \xe2\x80\x9cconfers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6; see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1927) (\xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cgive force to\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgive effect to\xe2\x80\x9d).  And by providing \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to federal district courts over certain suits, \xc2\xa727 strips state courts of jurisdiction over such suits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Put differently, under \xc2\xa727 a suit belongs in federal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an Exchange Act duty or liability.  In contrast, a suit belongs in state court when the complaint \xe2\x80\x9cassert[s] purely state-law causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d that do not require \xe2\x80\x9cbinding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment on the merits of\xe2\x80\x9d an Exchange Act breach.  <i>Matsushita Elec.

Such a suit is \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98brought to enforce\xe2\x80\x99 any rights or obligations under the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus does not fall within \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  <i>Id</i>., at 381.  So \xc2\xa727 does not provide federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties under state law or over every case that happens to involve allegations that the Act was violated.  The provision leaves state courts with some authority over suits involving the Act or its regulations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory context bolsters this understanding.  That context confirms that Congress reserved some authority to state courts to adjudicate securities-law matters.Although the Act provides numerous federal \xe2\x80\x9crights and remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d it also generally preserves \xe2\x80\x9call other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity,\xe2\x80\x9d such as claims that could be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778bb(a)(2).

A natural reading of \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s text preserves the dual role for federal and state courts that Congress contemplated, and it confirms that mere allegations of Exchange Act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A natural reading promotes the uniform interpretation of the federal securities laws that Congress sought to ensure when it gave federal courts \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over federal securities-law suits.  \xc2\xa778aa(a).  The textual approach fosters uniformity because it leaves to federal courts\xe2\x80\x94which are presumptively more familiar with the intricate federal securities laws\xe2\x80\x94the task of \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicat[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The complaint instead brings 10 state-law causes of action that seek to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law.  Count 2 alleges that petitioners violated state law by investing money derived from racketeering.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a\xe2\x80\x9393a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6114\xe2\x80\x93122 (citing N.\xc2\xa0J. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa72C:41\xe2\x80\x932a (West 2005)).  Counts 3 through 9 allege standard state-law contract and tort claims: unjust enrichment, unlawful interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contractual relations, unlawful interference with contractual relations, third-party-beneficiary claims, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence.  See App. to Pet. for Cert.<i> </i>93a\xe2\x80\x93101a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6123\xe2\x80\x93158.  Count 10 pleads a freestanding claim for punitive and exemplary damages.  See <i>id.,</i> at 101a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6159\xe2\x80\x93161.  None of these claims requires a court to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to give effect to\xe2\x80\x94a requirement created by the Act, thus, \xc2\xa727 does not confer federal jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Count 1 presents a closer call, but it too does not trigger federal jurisdiction.  That count pleads that petitioners violated a state law that makes it unlawful for a person to participate in a racketeering enterprise.  <i>Id.,</i> at 82a\xe2\x80\x9390a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb688\xe2\x80\x93113 (citing N.\xc2\xa0J. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa72C:41\xe2\x80\x932c).  The alleged racketeering includes violating the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law (through fraud, deception, and misappropriation), committing \xe2\x80\x9ctheft by taking\xe2\x80\x9d under state law, and committing \xe2\x80\x9ctheft by deception\xe2\x80\x9d under state law.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a\xe2\x80\x9390a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb688\xe2\x80\x93113.  Respondents allege that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he SEC has expressly noted that naked short selling involves the omission of a material fact\xe2\x80\x9d as part of their state-law securities fraud allegation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 85a, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb6100.  Vindicating that claim would not require the enforcement of a federal duty or liability.  New Jersey law encompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a violation of federal law or regulation.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa749:3\xe2\x80\x9349(e)(1) (West 2001) (fraud and deceit include \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny misrepresentation by word, conduct or in any manner of any material fact, either present or past, and any omission to disclose any such fact\xe2\x80\x9d); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a\xe2\x80\x9386a (invoking \xc2\xa749:3\xe2\x80\x9349 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>).  So although Count 1 refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view about naked short selling, that count does not require respondents to establish a violation of federal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim.  Because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 cause of action in Count 1 seeks to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law and does not necessarily depend on the breach of an Exchange Act duty or liability, \xc2\xa727 does not provide federal jurisdiction over that claim.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the Court acknowledges the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural reading\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa727, <i>ante,</i> at 6, it holds that \xc2\xa727 adopts the jurisdictional test that this Court uses to evaluate federal-question jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  See <i>ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310; see also <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9318.  Federal courts have the power to review cases \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law, \xc2\xa71331, including those in which the complaint brings state-law claims that \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc.</i> v. <i>Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg., </i>\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308,\n314 (2005)\n.  The Court wrongly equates the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71331 with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa727, and interprets the latter to require that a case raising state-law claims \xe2\x80\x9cmee[t] the \xe2\x80\x98arising under\xe2\x80\x99 standard\xe2\x80\x9d for that case to proceed in federal court.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8; see <i>ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  None of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationales for adopting that rule is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court first argues that \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible to infer that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa727, wished to depart from what we now understand as the \xe2\x80\x98arising under\xe2\x80\x99 standard\xe2\x80\x9d because there was no \xe2\x80\x9cwell-defined test\xe2\x80\x9d to depart from.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law construing \xc2\xa71331, the Court explains, \xe2\x80\x9cwas for many decades\xe2\x80\x94including when the Exchange Act passed\xe2\x80\x94highly unruly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But when Congress enacts a statute that uses different language from a prior statute, we normally presume that Congress did so to convey a different meaning.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Burke</i>,\n\n195 U.\xc2\xa0S. 176,\n190 (1904)\n (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ca change in phraseology creates a presumption of a change in intent\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would not have used such different language [in two statutes] without thereby intending a change of meaning\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given what we know about \xc2\xa71331, that presumption has force here.  Our \xc2\xa71331 case law was, as the Court notes, \xe2\x80\x9chighly unruly\xe2\x80\x9d when the Exchange Act was enacted in 1934.  Given the importance of clarity in jurisdictional statutes, see <i>Hertz Corp. </i>v. <i>Friend</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77,\n94 (2010)\n, it is quite a stretch to infer that Congress wished to embrace such an unpredictable test.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is especially true given that \xc2\xa727 does not use words supporting the convoluted arising-under standard.  Section 27 does not ask (for example) whether a federal issue is substantial or whether a ruling on that issue will upset the congressionally approved balance of federal and state power.  Indeed, \xc2\xa71331<i> itself</i> does not even use words supporting the arising-under standard.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10 (acknowledging that the arising-under standard \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not turn on \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, the Court has refused to give full effect to \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbroa[d] phras[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d and has instead \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuously construed and limited\xe2\x80\x9d that provision based on extratextual considerations, such as \xe2\x80\x9chistory,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe demands of reason and coherence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csound judicial policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romero</i> v. <i>International Terminal Operating Co.</i>,\n\n358 U.\xc2\xa0S. 354,\n379 (1959)\n.  Faced with a plain and focused text like \xc2\xa727, however, we should not rely on such considerations.  And importing factors from our \xc2\xa71331 arising-under jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x94such as a substantiality requirement and a federal-state balance requirement\xe2\x80\x94risks narrowing the class of cases that Congress meant to cover with \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s plain text.  For these reasons, it is unwise to read into \xc2\xa727 a decision to adopt the arising-under standard.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court next relies on two prior decisions\xe2\x80\x94<i>Pan American Petroleum Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty.</i>,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656 (1961)\n, and <i>Matsushita, </i>516<i> </i>U.\xc2\xa0S. 367.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9314.  Neither case justifies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to apply the arising-under standard to \xc2\xa727.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Pan American</i>, the Court held that Delaware state courts had jurisdiction over state-law contract claims that arose from contracts for the sale of natural gas.  366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 662\xe2\x80\x93665.  The Court reached that decision even though a provision of the Natural Gas Act provided exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98brought to enforce any liability or duty created by\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Act.  <i>Id.,</i> at 662 (quoting statute).  <i>Pan American</i> lends some support to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view today.  It applied the Court\xe2\x80\x99s arising-under precedents and \xe2\x80\x9cexplained that [the Natural Gas Act\xe2\x80\x99s] use of the term \xe2\x80\x98brought to enforce,\xe2\x80\x99 rather than \xe2\x80\x98arising under,\xe2\x80\x99 made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11; see <i>Pan American</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 665, n.\xc2\xa02; see also <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But <i>Pan American</i> does not require the Court to engraft the arising-under standard onto \xc2\xa727.  <i>Pan American</i> did not carefully analyze the Natural Gas Act\xe2\x80\x99s text or assess the contemporary meaning of the central phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, the Court relied on legislative history, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative [congressional] Committee Reports\xe2\x80\x9d implied a limitation on the Natural Gas Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional text.  366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 665, n.\xc2\xa02.  That reasoning does not warrant our respect.  That is especially true because <i>Pan American</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding is consistent with the Natural Gas Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbrought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d language.  The complaint in that case did not \xe2\x80\x9casser[t]\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under the Natural Gas Act\xe2\x80\x9d and instead asked the court to adjudicate standard state-law \xe2\x80\x9ccontract or quasi-contract\xe2\x80\x9d claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 663, 664.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition in <i>Pan American </i>rests as comfortably on the statutory text as it does on the arising-under standard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Matsushita </i>provides even less support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today.  In that case the Court held that Delaware courts could issue a judgment approving a settlement releasing securities-law claims even though the settlement released claims that were (by virtue of \xc2\xa727) \xe2\x80\x9csolely within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 375; see <i>id.,</i> at 370\xe2\x80\x93372.  The Court explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile \xc2\xa727 prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the Exchange Act, it does not prohibit state courts from approving the release of Exchange Act claims in the settlement of suits over which they have properly exercised jurisdiction, <i>i.e.,</i> suits arising under state law or under federal law for which there is concurrent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 381.  Because the complaint in that case \xe2\x80\x9cassert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d and the state courts did not issue \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment on the merits of the [exclusively federal] claims,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa727 did not deprive state courts of jurisdiction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 382.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court relies on <i>Matsushita</i> because in that case we three times \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa727 \xe2\x80\x9cas conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits \xe2\x80\x98arising under\xe2\x80\x99 the Exchange Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13 (citing 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 380, 381, 385).  But <i>Matsushita</i> did not decide whether \xc2\xa727 adopts the arising-under standard, so its passing use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d cannot bear the weight that the Court now places on it.  To be sure, <i>Matsushita</i> does support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <i>judgment</i> today: <i>Matsushita</i> emphasized that state courts could adjudicate a suit involving securities-law issues where the complaint \xe2\x80\x9cassert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d and did not require the state courts to issue \xe2\x80\x9cbinding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment on the merits of\xe2\x80\x9d an Exchange Act breach.  <i>Id.</i>, at 382, 384.  But those statements are more consistent with \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s text than they are with the arising-under standard.

But hewing to \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x99s text serves these goals as well as or better than does adopting the arising-under standard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the text-based view preserves state courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to adjudicate numerous securities-law claims and provide relief consistent with the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s design.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x933.  As explained above, that view places all of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-law causes of action in state court.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x935.  The text-based view thus \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[s] to construe [a] federal jurisdictional statut[e] more expansively than [its] language, most fairly read, requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the textual test is also more administrable than the arising-under standard.  The arising-under standard \xe2\x80\x9cis anything but clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grable</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The standard involves numerous judgments about matters of degree that are not readily susceptible to bright lines.  As noted, to satisfy that standard, a state-law claim must raise a federal issue that is (among other things) \xe2\x80\x9cactually disputed,\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d and will not \xe2\x80\x9cdistur[b]\xe2\x80\x9d a congressionally approved federal-state \xe2\x80\x9cbalance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 314 (opinion of Court).  The standard \xe2\x80\x9ccalls for a \xe2\x80\x98common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations\xe2\x80\x99 that present a federal issue, in \xe2\x80\x98a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 313 (quoting <i>Gully</i> v.<i> First Nat.

The arising-under standard may be many things, but it is not one that consistently \xe2\x80\x9cprovides ready answers\xe2\x80\x9d to hard jurisdictional questions.  <i>Ante,</i> at 17.
