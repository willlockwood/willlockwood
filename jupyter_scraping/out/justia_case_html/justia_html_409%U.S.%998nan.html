The novel describes in graphic detail sexual and drug and drug related activities that are a part of everyday life for those who live in Spanish Harlem. Its purpose was to acquaint the youth of Queens with the problems of their contemporaries in this social setting. The book was objected to by some parents and after a public meeting the School Board by a vote of 5-3 banned it from the libraries. A later vote by the Board amended the order so the book is now kept on the shelves for direct loan to any parent who wants his or her children to have access to it. To child can borrow it directly. This suit was brought on behalf of a principal, a librarian, and various parents and children who request that the court declare the resolution adopted by the Board unconstitutional, and order the defendants to place the book on normal circulation in the libraries and enjoin them from interfering with other school libraries within their jurisdiction which desire to purchase the book.

[Education Code, McKinney\'s Consol.Laws, c. 16] 2590-e(3) Gives the Board power to \'determine matters relating to the instruction of students including the selection of textbooks and other instructional materials . . .,\' provided they are approved by the Chancellor. The Commissioners\' regulation says that secondary school book collections \'shall consist of books approved as satisfactory for (1) supplementing the curriculum (2) reference and general information (3) appreciation and (4) pleasure reading,\' 8 N.Y. Code, Rules &amp; Regs.Educ., 91.1(b) (1966). Even a casual reading of these regulations show they contain no discreet limitations for the type spoken of in Cantwell v. Conn., <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html">310 U.S. 296</a>, Speiser v. Randall, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html">357 U.S. 513</a> or Shelton v.
