J. Harmon for a railroad ticket from Asheville, North Carolina, to Canton, North Carolina, in violation of the state law.  He was arrested and brought before the court, and, on the trial, July 18, 1907, was convicted and sentenced by the court to imprisonment in the county jail of Buncombe County for the term of thirty days, to be worked on the public roads of that county for that time, and to pay all costs.</p>\n<p>The appellee applied to the United States circuit judge in the Western District of North Carolina for a writ of habeas corpus, to be directed to Hunter, appellant, as Sheriff of Buncombe </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 209 U.

After the passage of the acts above mentioned, which greatly reduced the rates of compensation for the transportation of both passengers and freight, the Southern Railway Company commenced a suit in equity in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of North Carolina against the Corporation Commission and the attorney general and assistant attorney general of the state to enjoin the taking of any proceedings or the commencement of any suits or actions to enforce the acts in question or to recover penalties for the disobedience of such acts by the company.  The bill alleged that the acts were unconstitutional and that, if the rates were enforced, the result would be to prevent the company\'s earning anything upon its investment, and deprive it of its property without due process of law, and deny it the equal protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The bill also averred that a duty rested upon the Corporation Commission and the attorney general and assistant attorney general to take such proceedings as they might deem expedient for the enforcement of the acts, and that the Corporation Commission would, for the purpose of putting the acts into effect, do those things which it was provided should be done, and, in case of continuous refusal on the part of the company to charge only the rate specified, the attorney general and his assistant would proceed to enforce the same as prescribed in the acts. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 209 U.

The order also provided for the execution of a bond on the part of the railway company in the sum of $325,000, conditioned to pay into the registry of the court, from time to time, as the court might order, such sums of money as should be equal to the difference between the aggregate freight and passenger rates and excess baggage charges, charged and received by the company for intrastate service on its lines in the State of North Carolina, and what would have been the aggregate amounts for such service at the rates fixed in or under the acts of the assembly above mentioned.

JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>After the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States had attached by the filing of the bill of complaint in the case already mentioned, of the <em>Southern Railway Company v. McNeil and others,</em> members of the Corporation Commission, and after the issuing and service of the injunction, as above stated, the defendant Wood, acting under and in obedience to the provisions of such injunction, sold the railroad tickets at the usual price, and at the same time, complied with the conditions contained in the injunction, by giving the coupons for the difference in price, and, while so complying with the terms of such injunction, was arrested and proceeded against criminally for disobedience of the act fixing rates.  Being detained in custody by virtue of this conviction by one of the police courts of the state, he had the right to apply for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States circuit judge, and that judge had power to issue the writ and discharge the prisoner under \xc2\xa7 753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (1. U.S.Comp.Stat. 1901, p. 592), as he was then in custody for an act done pursuant to an order, process, or decree of a court or judge of the United States.  <em>See In re Neagle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/135/1/case.html">135 U. S. 1</a></span>.  The writ being properly issued, the judge had the right, and it was his duty, to examine into the facts, and had jurisdiction to discharge the petitioner under the circumstances stated.</p>\n<p>The other questions raised herein have been sufficiently discussed in <em>Ex Parte Young,</em> just decided, and require no further attention. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 209 U. S. 211</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For the reasons given in that opinion, the order appealed from herein must be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting:</p>\n<p>In my judgment, the appellee should have been put to his writ of error for the review of the judgment against him in the highest court of the state competent under the state laws to reexamine that judgment, thence to this Court to inquire whether any right belonging to him under the federal Constitution had been violated.  He should not have been discharged on habeas corpus.  <em>Ex Parte Royall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/117/241/case.html">117 U. S. 241</a></span>; <em>Minnesota v. Brundage,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/180/499/case.html">180 U. S. 499</a></span>; <em>Urquhart v.

For the reasons there stated, I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
