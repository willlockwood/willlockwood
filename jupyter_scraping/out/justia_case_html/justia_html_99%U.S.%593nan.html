CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE announced the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>This application comes directly within the rule laid down in <em>Hurley v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/318/case.html">97 U. S. 318</a></span>.  As we took occasion to say in that case, "our rules requiring causes to be ready for hearing when reached are and will continue to be rigidly enforced."  We recognize no <em>pro forma</em> attorneys of record.  Counsel who enter their appearance under the requirements of Rule 9 must understand that the Court will hold them responsible for all that such an entry implies until they relieve themselves from the obligation they assume, by substitution or otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
