Following a trial by jury, he was found guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for from 3 to 10 years.  A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 330 F.2d 220.  A petition for rehearing en banc was denied, four judges dissenting. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 380 U. S. 446</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Slightly more than two hours after the jury retired to deliberate, the jury sent a note to the trial judge advising that it had been unable to agree upon a verdict "on both counts because of insufficient evidence."  The judge thereupon recalled the jury to the courtroom and, in the course of his response, stated that "You have got to reach a decision in this case."  We granted certiorari, 379 U.S. 944, to consider whether, in its context and under all the circumstances of this case, the statement was coercive.  The Solicitor General, in his brief in this Court, stated:</p>\n<p>"Of course, if this Court should conclude that the judge\'s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it, the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial; the principle that jurors may not be coerced into surrendering views conscientiously held is so clear as to require no elaboration."</p>\n<p>Upon review of the record, we conclude that, in its context and under all the circumstances, the judge\'s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.  <em>Cf. Brasfield v.
