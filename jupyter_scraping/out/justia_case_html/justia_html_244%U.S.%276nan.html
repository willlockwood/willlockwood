JUSTICE CLARKE delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p>The judgment obtained in this case by the plaintiff in the district court, W. C. Chatman, and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, is here for review on writ of error.</p>\n<p>On December 1, 1911, the plaintiff below (hereinafter designated as the plaintiff) delivered to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at Jersey City a carload of horses to be carried to Hertford, North Carolina, and was tendered by an agent of the company for his signature the customary "uniform livestock contract" of the Pennsylvania Company, the essential provisions of which are printed in the margin. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/276/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 244 U. S. 278</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This contract was retained by the company, but from it was detached a "coupon" which was given to Chatman, containing in substance an acknowledgment that he had delivered livestock of the kind and nature therein described, consigned to W. C. Chatman, destination Port Norfolk, Virginia, for Hertford, North Carolina, "W. C. Chatman, man </p><p><a class="page-number" name="279">Page 244 U. S. 279</a></p><p> in charge."  Without other pass or ticket than this "coupon," and without other payment than the published tariff on the carload of stock, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company carried the plaintiff, with his carload of horses, on a freight train to Norfolk, Virginia, where the car was delivered to and accepted by the defendant company for transportation to its destination.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff testifies that defendant\'s conductor saw him and knew he was on the car up to the time the accident complained of occurred.</p>\n<p>The car in which the horses and the plaintiff were being carried was derailed on defendant\'s line, and the plaintiff, being injured, sued for damages and secured the judgment which we have before us.</p>\n<p>The negligence of the defendant is not disputed.</p>\n<p>On this record, the defendant claims two defenses, the first of which is:</p>\n<p>That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover because, when injured, he was traveling on a free pass issued pursuant to the terms of the livestock contract in which he had released the carriers from all liability for any personal injury which he might sustain, thus bringing his claim within the authority of <em>Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/192/440/case.html">192 U.

S. 17</a></span> Wall. 357,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/84/357/case.html#365">84 U. S. 365</a></span>), and that they have continued in use up to this time is apparent from the decisions hereinbefore cited, from the cases at bar, and from many cited, from the case at bar, and from many recently reported cases.  <em>Tripp v. Michigan Central R. Co.,</em> 238 F. 449.  Notwithstanding the fact, as we have seen, that such transportation has been declared by a long line of decisions not to be "free" in the popular sense, but to be transportation for hire, with all of the legal incidents of paid transportation, the carriers of the country have continued to issue it and to designate it as "free."</p>\n<p>With this legal and commercial history before us, we must conclude that the designation "free pass," as applied to transportation issued or given by railroad companies to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 244 U. S. 281</a></p><p> shippers and caretakers of stock, had acquired a definite and well known meaning, sanctioned by the decisions of this Court and widely by the decisions of the courts of the various states, long prior to the enactment of June 29, 1906, and that therefore Congress must be presumed to have used the designation "free pass" in the sense given to it by this judicial determination when, in \xc2\xa7 1 of that act, by specific exception, it permitted the continuance of the then long established custom of issuing free transportation or passes to shippers or caretakers of livestock.  <em>Kepner v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/195/100/case.html">195 U. S. 100</a></span>; <em>Lawder v.

S. 293</a></span>; Sutherland, Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 333.</p>\n<p>It results that the "settled rule of policy" established by the <em>Lockwood</em> case and the decisions following it must be considered unmodified by the Act to Regulate Commerce; that the plaintiff in charge of his stock, traveling upon a pass permitted to be issued by that act, was a passenger for hire, and that defendant\'s first claim must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p>The claim of the defendant that the plaintiff was unlawfully upon its train because its published tariff did not allow the issuing of such a pass as that which the plaintiff was using when injured is without merit.</p>\n<p>The extract from the defendant\'s tariff, relied upon to sustain this claim, reads:</p>\n<p>"Free or reduced transportation shall not be issued for shippers or caretakers in charge of livestock shipments, whether carloads or less, and such shippers or caretakers shall pay full fare <em>returning.</em>"</p>\n<p>It is sufficient answer to this claim to say that the railroad company is here defending under the release from liability contained in a contract of carriage, issued as required by law (\xc2\xa7 7 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 595), pursuant to the published tariffs of its connecting, the initial, carrier, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 244 U. S. 282</a></p><p> and it will not be heard in the courts to urge the inconsistent defense that its own tariff made unlawful this contract on which, in the alternative, it relies.</p>\n<p>To this we add that passes for caretakers, not only to destination, but returning to point of shipment, were formerly general (<em>Cleveland, Painesville &amp;c. R. Co. v. Curran,</em> 19 Ohio St. 1), and in some parts of the country are still issued (<em>Kirkendall v. Union Pacific R. Co.,</em> 200 F. 197, 200), and that, in our opinion, the language of the notice quoted, while obscuredly worded, implies that such passes will be issued by the defendant to destination of the shipment, and was intended as notice to shippers that return passes would not be allowed.  The meaning now claimed for this notice would have been unmistakably expressed without the final clause, "and such shippers or caretakers shall pay full fare returning."  Why "returning," if full fare were also to be paid "going?"  Tariffs must not be made cunningly devised nets in which to entangle unsuspicious or inexperienced shippers.</p>\n<p>The second defense of the railroad company is in the alternative, and must be considered because its first defense has failed.</p>\n<p>This claim is that, under the interstate commerce law, payment for the transportation of passengers for hire could be made only in money, and at a rate stated in a tariff filed and published in the manner required by law; that no separate payment for plaintiff\'s transportation was made in money, and the consideration for it must be found, if at all, incorporated in the rate charged for the stock, or in the service which he was to render in caring for it in transit, and that, as neither of these was separately stated in any filed and published tariff, the plaintiff\'s presence upon the car was unlawful, and he should not recover for injuries sustained.</p>\n<p>In the consideration of this second claim of the defendant, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 244 U. S. 283</a></p><p> these facts, appearing of record, are decisive:  the defendant relies for its defense upon the terms of the livestock contract entered into between its connecting carrier, the Pennsylvania Company, and the plaintiff, and, averring in its answer that it received the shipment of horses "in accordance with the terms of said contract," it claims immunity from liability for damages to the plaintiff under the declaration of that contract that:</p>\n<p>"In consideration of the carriage of the undersigned [plaintiff] upon a freight train of the carrier or carriers named in the contract without charge other than the sum paid or to be paid for the carriage . . . of the livestock . . . , the plaintiff assumed the risk of accident and released said carrier or carriers from all liability to him for any injury which he might sustain."</p>\n<p>While the record is not as clear as could be wished, the excerpts which it contains from the filed tariffs of the Pennsylvania Company and the livestock contract, both introduced in evidence by the defendant, justify the conclusion, certainly as against the defendant, that the contract was a part of the tariffs of the Pennsylvania Company, filed and published according to law, and that the defendant is bound by its terms.</p>\n<p>Treating this livestock contract as a part of the lawfully published tariffs of the Pennsylvania Company, under which the contract for the carriage of the plaintiff was made and by which the defendant confesses itself bound, it is clear that such tariffs show the two carriers declaring that, for the published rate, payable in money, the plaintiff\'s carload of stock and the plaintiff himself, as a caretaker, would be carried on freight trains from Jersey City to the North Carolina destination; and, as we have seen, the law declares that a caretaker so carried is a passenger for hire, against whom the release of liability on which the defendant relies must be treated as unreasonable and void. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 244 U. S. 284</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The objection that the published tariff of the Pennsylvania Company did not specify how much of the stipulated payment by the plaintiff should be treated as payment for the transportation of the stock and how much for the transportation of the caretaker, and that the payment for the carriage of the plaintiff was not separately stated in a passenger tariff, cannot be considered in this case, for the reason that the Act to Regulate Commerce (\xc2\xa7 6, as amended June 29, 1906, June 18, 1910 and August 24, 1912) commits to the Interstate Commerce Commission the determining and prescribing of the form in which tariff schedules shall be prepared and arranged, and this is an obviously administrative function with which the courts will not interfere in advance of a prior application to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry.
