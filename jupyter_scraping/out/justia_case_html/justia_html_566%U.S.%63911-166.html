The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Pursuant to \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to confirm a \xe2\x80\x9ccramdown\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy plan over the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  That plan proposed selling substantially all of the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 property at an auction, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank.  Under the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 request, concluding that the auction procedures did not comply with \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for cramdown plans.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale.

To finance the purchase, the renovation of the hotel, and construction of the parking structure, the debtors obtained a $142 million loan from Longview Ultra Construction Loan Investment Fund, for which respondent Amalgamated Bank (hereinafter creditor or Bank) serves as trustee.  The lenders obtained a blanket lien on all of the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 assets to secure the loan.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCompleting the parking structure proved more expensive than anticipated, and within two years the debtors had run out of funds and were forced to halt construction.  By August 2009, they owed more than $120 million on the loan, with over $1 million in interest accruing every month and no prospect for obtaining additional funds to complete the project.  Both debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA Chapter 11 bankruptcy is implemented according to a \xe2\x80\x9cplan,\xe2\x80\x9d typically proposed by the debtor, which divides claims against the debtor into separate \xe2\x80\x9cclasses\xe2\x80\x9d and specifies the treatment each class will receive.  See \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71123.  Generally, a bankruptcy court may confirm a Chapter 11 plan only if each class of creditors affected by the plan consents.  See \xc2\xa71129(a)(8).  Section 1129(b) creates an exception to that general rule, per- mitting confirmation of nonconsensual plans\xe2\x80\x94commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9ccramdown\xe2\x80\x9d plans\xe2\x80\x94if \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1129(b)(2)(A), which we review in further depth below, establishes criteria for determining whether a cramdown plan is \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to secured claims like the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2010, the RadLAX debtors submitted a Chapter 11 plan to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The plan proposed to dissolve the debtors and to sell substantially all of their assets pursuant to procedures set out in a contemporaneously filed \xe2\x80\x9cSale and Bid Procedures Motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Specifically, the debtors sought to auction their assets to the highest bidder, with the initial bid submitted by a \xe2\x80\x9cstalking horse\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a potential purchaser who was willing to make an advance bid of $47.5 million.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The sale proceeds would be used to fund the plan, primarily by repaying the Bank.

Under the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 proposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would not be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, the Bank would be forced to bid cash.

A well established canon of statutory interpretation succinctly captures the problem: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374, \n384 (1992)\n.  That is particularly true where, as in \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A), \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Varity Corp. v.

To eliminate the contradiction, the specific provision is construed as an exception to the general one.  See, e.g., Morton v. Mancari, \n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535\n\xe2\x80\x93551 (1974).  But the canon has full application as well to statutes such as the one here, in which a general authorization and a more limited, specific authorization exist side-by-side.  There the canon avoids not contradiction but the superfluity of a specific provision that is swallowed by the general one, \xe2\x80\x9cviolat[ing] the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall be given to every clause and part of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204, \n208 (1932)\n.  The terms of the specific authorization must be complied with.  For example, in the last cited case a provision of the Bankruptcy Act prescribed in great detail the procedures governing the arrest and detention of bankrupts about to leave the district in order to avoid examination.  The Court held that those prescriptions could not be avoided by relying upon a general provision of the Act authoriz- ing bankruptcy courts to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those spe- cifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of [the] Act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 206 (quoting Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \xc2\xa72(15), \n\n30Stat.\n546).  The Court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 208.  We recently quoted that language approvingly in Bloate v. United States, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10).  Or as we said in a much earlier case:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an old and familiar rule that, where there is, in the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.  This rule applies wherever an act contains general provisions and also special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the general provisions would include.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Chase, \n\n135 U.\xc2\xa0S. 255, \n260 (1890)\n (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tHere, clause (ii) is a detailed provision that spells out the requirements for selling collateral free of liens, while clause (iii) is a broadly worded provision that says nothing about such a sale.  The general/specific canon explains that the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral language\xe2\x80\x9d of clause (iii), \xe2\x80\x9calthough broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (ii).

The debtors point to no such indi- cation here.  One can conceive of a statutory scheme in which the specific provision embraced within a general one is not superfluous, because it creates a so-called safe harbor.  The debtors effectively contend that that is the case here\xe2\x80\x94clause (iii) (\xe2\x80\x9cindubitable equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d) being the general rule, and clauses (i) and (ii) setting forth procedures that will always, ipso facto, establish an \xe2\x80\x9cindubitable equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d with no need for judicial evaluation.  But the structure here would be a surpassingly strange manner of accomplishing that result\xe2\x80\x94which would normally be achieved by setting forth the \xe2\x80\x9cindubitable equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d rule first (rather than last), and establishing the two safe harbors as provisos to that rule.  The structure here suggests, to the contrary, that (i) is the rule for plans under which the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s lien remains on the property, (ii) is the rule for plans under which the property is sold free and clear of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s lien, and (iii) is a residual provision covering dispositions under all other plans\xe2\x80\x94for example, one under which the creditor receives the property itself, the \xe2\x80\x9cindubitable equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of its secured claim.  Thus, debtors may not sell their property free of liens under \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) without allowing lienholders to credit-bid, as required by clause (ii).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 objections to this approach is valid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe debtors\xe2\x80\x99 principal textual argument is that \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously provides three distinct options for confirming a Chapter 11 plan over the objection of a secured creditor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 15 (capitalization and bold typeface removed).  With that much we agree; the three clauses of \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) are connected by the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor.\xe2\x80\x9d  The debtors contend that our interpretation of \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) \xe2\x80\x9ctransforms \xe2\x80\x98or\xe2\x80\x99 into \xe2\x80\x98and.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 3.  But that is not so.  The question here is not whether debtors must comply with more than one clause, but rather which one of the three they must satisfy.  Debtors seeking to sell their property free of liens under \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) must satisfy the requirements of clause (ii), not the requirements of both clauses (ii) and (iii).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe debtors make several arguments against applying the general/specific canon.  They contend that clause (ii) is no more specific than clause (iii), because the former provides a procedural protection to secured creditors (credit-bidding) while the latter provides a substantive protection (indubitable equivalence).  As a result, they say, clause (ii) is not \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting subset\xe2\x80\x9d of clause (iii), which (according to their view) application of the general/specific canon requires.  Brief for Petitioners 30\xe2\x80\x9331; Reply Brief for Petitioners 5\xe2\x80\x936.  To begin with, we know of no authority for the proposition that the canon is confined to situations in which the entirety of the specific provision is a \xe2\x80\x9csubset\xe2\x80\x9d of the general one.  When the conduct at issue falls within the scope of both provisions, the specific presumptively governs, whether or not the specific provision also applies to some conduct that falls outside the general.  In any case, we think clause (ii) is entirely a subset.  Clause (iii) applies to all cramdown plans, which include all of the plans within the more narrow category described in clause (ii).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That its requirements are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d whereas clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s are \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d is quite beside the point.  What counts for application of the general/specific canon is not the nature of the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 prescriptions but their scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the debtors contend that the Court of Appeals conflated approval of bid procedures with plan confirmation.  Brief for Petitioners 39.  They claim the right to pursue their auction now, leaving it for the Bankruptcy Judge to determine, at the confirmation stage, whether the resulting plan (funded by auction proceeds) provides the Bank with the \xe2\x80\x9cindubitable equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of its secured claim.  Under our interpretation of \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A), how- ever, that approach is simply a nonstarter.  As a matter of law, no bid procedures like the ones proposed here could satisfy the requirements of \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A), and the distinction between approval of bid procedures and plan confirmation is therefore irrelevant.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties debate at some length the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, pre-Code practices, and the merits of credit-bidding.  To varying extents, some of those debates also occupied the attention of the Courts of Appeals that considered the question presented here.  See, e.g., In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 599 F.\xc2\xa03d 298, 314\xe2\x80\x93317 (CA3 2010); id., at 331\xe2\x80\x93337 (Ambro, J., dissenting).  But nothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting secured creditors can overcome the specific manner of that protection which the text of \xc2\xa71129(b)(2)(A) contains.  As for pre-Code practices, they can be relevant to the interpretation of an ambiguous text, but we find no textual ambiguity here.  And the pros and cons of credit-bidding are for the consideration of Congress, not the courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and sometimes unruly) area of law, and it is our obligation to interpret the Code clearly and predictably using well established principles of statutory construction.  See United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235\n\xe2\x80\x93241 (1989).  Under that approach, this is an easy case.  Because the RadLAX debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Kennedy took no part in the decision of this case.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In a later proposal, the stalking-horse bid increased to $55 million.
