The judges of the circuit court were opposed in opinion on the question of granting this motion, and, having overruled it, have certified the division to this Court.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it is made to appear to us by the return of the marshal and by affidavits, that on the second day of October, three days after the order was made overruling the motion, and ten days before the writ of error herein was served by filing it in the clerk\'s office of the circuit court, the marshal had executed the original order of the court by placing the prisoner on board the steamship New York, one of the Pacific Mail steamships, about to start for China, and that she departed on said vessel on the seventh day of October.  It thus appears that the order of deportation had been fully executed, and the petitioner in the writ of habeas corpus placed without the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 113 U. S. 218</a></p><p> jurisdiction of the court and of the United States six days before the writ of error was filed in the circuit court and several days before it was issued.  The question, therefore, which we are asked to decide is a moot question as to plaintiff in error, and if she was permitted to give bail, it could be of no value to her, as the order by which she was remanded has been executed, and she is no longer in the custody of the marshal or in prison.</p>\n<p>This Court does not sit here to decide questions arising in cases which no longer exist in regard to rights which it cannot enforce.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of error is dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
