They are not final judgments, within the meaning of the Judiciary Act of 1789. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Of course they are not within the meaning of the 9th section of the organic act of the territory. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It appears also that the writ of error bears the teste of the clerk of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana, and not the teste of the Chief Justice of this Court.  But the statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 80 U.
