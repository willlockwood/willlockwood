But that section imposes no penalty for a noncompliance with its provisions.</p>\n<p>Section 6 contains requirements in regard to the packing of oleomargarine by manufacturers and in regard to the packages in which sales shall be made by manufacturers, wholesale dealers, and retail dealers, and imposes a penalty for the violation of its requirements.</p>\n<p>Section 7 contains requirements as to putting a label on each package by the manufacturer and imposes a penalty for not doing it.</p>\n<p>Section 8 provides for collecting a tax of two cents a pound on the article from the manufacturer by coupon stamps and applies the requirements of law as to stamps relating to tobacco and snuff.</p>\n<p>Section 9 provides for assessing and collecting the tax which has not been paid by stamps, and declares that such tax shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for the sale or removal of the article without the payment of such tax.</p>\n<p>Section 10 provides for an additional tax on imported oleomargarine, by stamps to be affixed and canceled while it is in the custody of customs officers, and for warehousing the article, and it imposes a penalty for a violation of the section by a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 144 U.

S. 686</a></p><p> of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation require, and such books shall be open at all times to the inspection of any internal revenue officer or agent."</p>\n<p>But although the regulation above recited may have been a proper one to be made, under \xc2\xa7 20 of the Act of August 2, 1886, yet the question to be determined in this case is whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine who knowingly and willfully fails and omits to keep the book and make the monthly return prescribed in the regulation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue thereby fails and omits, within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 18 of the act to do a thing "required by law in the carrying on or conducting of his business" so as to be liable to the penalty prescribed by that section.</p>\n<p>In this connection it is worthy of observation that \xc2\xa7 5 of the act requires that every manufacturer of oleomargarine shall keep such books, and render such returns of materials and products, as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation require, but it imposes no penalty on the manufacturer for any neglect to keep such books and render such returns, nor does it impose a duty to keep the books and render the returns on a wholesale dealer in the article, such as the defendant in this case was.  The question therefore is whether a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, who omits to keep the books or to render the returns prescribed by the regulation made under the authority of \xc2\xa7 20 of the act is liable to the penalty prescribed by \xc2\xa7 18, as having omitted or failed to do a thing "required by law in the carrying on or conducting of his business" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 18.</p>\n<p>Regulations for carrying the act into effect, to be made under the provisions of \xc2\xa7 20, are necessary, as they are in various departments of the public service.  By \xc2\xa7 161 of the Revised Statutes, the head of each department is authorized</p>\n<p>"to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with law for the government of his department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of the records, papers, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 144 U. S. 687</a></p><p> property appertaining to it,"</p>\n<p>and by \xc2\xa7 251, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to make and issue instructions and regulations to collectors, receivers, depositaries, officers, and others, and to prescribe rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, to be used in executing and enforcing the internal revenue laws and laws relating to raising revenue from imports, or duties on imports, or to warehousing.</p>\n<p>Section 20 of the act in question would be fully carried out by making regulations of the character of those provided for in \xc2\xa7 161 and \xc2\xa7 251 of the Revised Statutes, without extending the provision of \xc2\xa7 18 so as to make a criminal offense, as a neglect to do a thing "required by law," of a neglect to do a thing required only by a regulation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p>It is well settled that there are no common law offenses against the United States.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/11/32/case.html">United States v.

S. 466</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/466/case.html#467">106 U. S. 467</a></span>, that the Secretary of the Treasury cannot by his regulations alter or amend a revenue law, and that all he can do is to regulate the mode of proceeding to carry into effect what Congress has enacted. Accordingly, it was held in that case, under \xc2\xa7 2505 of the Revised Statutes, which provided that live animals specially imported for breeding purposes from beyond the seas should be admitted free of duty, upon proof thereof satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury and under such regulations as he might prescribe, that he had no authority to prescribe a regulation requiring that, before admitting the animals free, the collector should be satisfied that they were of superior stock, adapted to improving the breed in the United States.</p>\n<p>Much more does this principle apply to a case where it is sought substantially to prescribe a criminal offense by the regulation of a department.  It is a principle of criminal law that an offense which may be the subject of criminal procedure is an act committed or omitted "in violation of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 144 U. S. 688</a></p><p> public law either forbidding or commanding it."  4 American &amp; English Encyclopedia of Law 642; 4 Bl.Com. 5.</p>\n<p>It would be a very dangerous principle to hold that a thing prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as a needful regulation under the Oleomargarine Act for carrying it into effect, could be considered as a thing "required by law" in the carrying on or conducting of the business of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine in such manner as to become a criminal offense punishable under \xc2\xa7 18 of the act, particularly when the same act, in \xc2\xa7 5, requires a manufacturer of the article to keep such books and render such returns as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may, by regulation, require, and does not impose, in that section or elsewhere in the act, the duty of keeping such books and rendering such returns upon a wholesale dealer in the article.</p>\n<p>It is necessary that a sufficient statutory authority should exist for declaring any act or omission a criminal offense, and we do not think that the statutory authority in the present case is sufficient.  If Congress intended to make it an offense for wholesale dealers in oleomargarine to omit to keep books and render returns as required by regulations to be made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, it would have done so distinctly, in connection with an enactment such as that above recited, made in \xc2\xa7 41 of the Act of October 1, 1890.</p>\n<p>Regulations prescribed by the President and by the heads of departments, under authority granted by Congress, may be regulations prescribed by law, so as lawfully to support acts done under them and in accordance with them, and may thus have in a proper sense the force of law, but it does not follow that a thing required by them is a thing so required by law as to make the neglect to do the thing a criminal offense in a citizen where a statute does not distinctly make the neglect in question a criminal offense.</p>\n<p><em>The questions certified are answered in the negative.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
