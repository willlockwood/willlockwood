We conclude, in accordance with the vast majority of lower courts that have addressed the issue, that it does not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In early 1984, Investigator Jenny Stracner of the Laguna Beach Police Department received information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking.  Stracner learned that a criminal suspect had informed a federal drug enforcement agent in February, 1984, that a truck filled with illegal drugs was en route to the Laguna Beach address at which Greenwood resided.  In addition, a neighbor complained of heavy vehicular traffic late at night in front of Greenwood\'s single-family home.  The neighbor reported that the vehicles remained at Greenwood\'s house for only a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Stracner sought to investigate this information by conducting a surveillance of Greenwood\'s home.  She observed several vehicles make brief stops at the house during the late-night and early-morning hours, and she followed a truck from the house to a residence that had previously been under investigation as a narcotics trafficking location.</p>\n<p>On April 6, 1984, Stracner asked the neighborhood\'s regular trash collector to pick up the plastic garbage bags that Greenwood had left on the curb in front of his house and to turn the bags over to her without mixing their contents with garbage from other houses.  The trash collector cleaned his truck bin of other refuse, collected the garbage bags from the street in front of Greenwood\'s house, and turned the bags over to Stracner.  The officer searched through the rubbish </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 486 U. S. 38</a></p><p> and found items indicative of narcotics use.  She recited the information that she had gleaned from the trash search in an affidavit in support of a warrant to search Greenwood\'s home.</p>\n<p>Police officers encountered both respondents at the house later that day when they arrived to execute the warrant.  The police discovered quantities of cocaine and hashish during their search of the house.  Respondents were arrested on felony narcotics charges.  They subsequently posted bail.</p>\n<p>The police continued to receive reports of many late-night visitors to the Greenwood house.  On May 4, Investigator Robert Rahaeuser obtained Greenwood\'s garbage from the regular trash collector in the same manner as had Stracner.  The garbage again contained evidence of narcotics use.</p>\n<p>Rahaeuser secured another search warrant for Greenwood\'s home based on the information from the second trash search. The police found more narcotics and evidence of narcotics trafficking when they executed the warrant.  Greenwood was again arrested.</p>\n<p>The Superior Court dismissed the charges against respondents on the authority of <em>People v. Krivda,</em> 5 Cal.3d 357, 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.  The court found that the police would not have had probable cause to search the Greenwood home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal affirmed.  182 Cal.App.3d 729, 227 Cal.Rptr. 539 (1986).  The court noted at the outset that the fruits of warrantless trash searches could no longer be suppressed if <em>Krivda</em> were based only on the California Constitution, because, since 1982, the State has barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of California law but not federal law.  <em>See</em> Cal.Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 28(d); <em>In re Lance W.,</em> 37 Cal.3d 873, 694 P.2d 744 (1985).  But <em>Krivda,</em> a decision binding on the Court of Appeal, also held that the fruits of warrantless trash searches were to be excluded under federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 486 U. S. 39</a></p><p> law.  Hence, the Superior Court was correct in dismissing the charges against respondents.  182 Cal.App.3d at 735, 227 Cal.Rptr, at 542. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court denied the State\'s petition for review of the Court of Appeal\'s decision.  We granted certiorari, 483 U.S. 1019, and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The warrantless search and seizure of the garbage bags left at the curb outside the Greenwood house would violate the Fourth Amendment only if respondents manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in their garbage that society accepts as objectively reasonable.  <em>O\'Connor v.

Respondents do not disagree with this standard.</p>\n<p>They assert, however, that they had, and exhibited, an expectation of privacy with respect to the trash that was searched by the police:  the trash, which was placed on the street for collection at a fixed time, was contained in opaque plastic bags, which the garbage collector was expected to pick up, mingle with the trash of others, and deposit at the garbage dump.  The trash was only temporarily on the street, and there was little likelihood that it would be inspected by anyone.</p>\n<p>It may well be that respondents did not expect that the contents of their garbage bags would become known to the police or other members of the public.  An expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 486 U. S. 40</a></p><p> however, unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p>Here, we conclude that respondents exposed their garbage to the public sufficiently to defeat their claim to Fourth Amendment protection.  It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] children, scavengers, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] snoops, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and other members of the public.  <em>See Krivda,</em> 5 Cal.3d at 367, 486 P.2d at 1269.  Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through respondents\' trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.  Accordingly, having deposited their garbage</p>\n<p>"in an area particularly suited for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 486 U. S. 41</a></p><p> public inspection and, in a manner of speaking, public consumption, for the express purpose of having strangers take it,"</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Reicherter,</em> 647 F.2d 397, 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.  Hence, "[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection."  <em>Katz v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#351">389 U. S. 351</a></span>.  We held in <em>Smith v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/735/case.html">442 U. S. 735</a></span> (1979), for example, that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by causing a pen register to be installed at the telephone company\'s offices to record the telephone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect.  An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on his telephone, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveys those numbers to the telephone company when he uses the telephone.  Again, we observed that "a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/735/case.html#743">442 U. S. 743</a></span>-744.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we held in <em>California v. Ciraolo, supra,</em> that the police were not required by the Fourth Amendment to obtain a warrant before conducting surveillance of the respondent\'s fenced backyard from a private plane flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet.  We concluded that the respondent\'s expectation that his yard was protected from such surveillance was unreasonable, because "[a]ny member of the public flying in this airspace who glanced down could have seen everything that these officers observed."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/207/case.html#213">476 U. S. 213</a></span>-214.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that society would not accept as reasonable respondents\' claim to an expectation of privacy in trash left for collection in an area accessible to the public is reinforced by the unanimous rejection of similar claims by the Federal Courts of Appeals.  <em>See United States v.

He urges that the state law right of Californians to privacy in their garbage, announced by the California Supreme Court in <em>Krivda, supra,</em> survived the subsequent state constitutional amendment eliminating the suppression remedy as a means of enforcing that right.  <em>See In re Lance W.,</em> 37 Cal.3d at 886-887, 694 P.2d at 752-753.  Hence, he argues that the Fourth Amendment should itself vindicate that right.</p>\n<p>Individual States may surely construe their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than does the Federal Constitution.  We have never intimated, however, that whether or not a search is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment depends on the law of the particular State in which the search occurs.  We have emphasized instead that the Fourth Amendment analysis must turn on such factors as "our <em>societal</em> understanding that certain areas deserve the most scrupulous protection from government invasion."  <em>Oliver v.

In his view, having recognized a state law right to be free from warrantless searches of garbage, California may not under the Due Process Clause deprive its citizens of what he describes as "the only effective deterrent" to violations of this right.  Greenwood concedes that no direct support for his position can be found in the decisions of this Court.  He relies instead on cases holding that individuals are entitled to certain procedural protections before they can be deprived of a liberty or property interest created by state law.  <em>See Hewitt v. Helms,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html">459 U. S. 460</a></span> (1983); <em>Vitek v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html">445 U. S. 480</a></span> (1980).</p>\n<p>We see no merit in Greenwood\'s position.  California could amend its Constitution to negate the holding in <em>Krivda</em> that state law forbids warrantless searches of trash.  We are convinced that the State may likewise eliminate the exclusionary rule as a remedy for violations of that right.  At the federal level, we have not required that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment be suppressed in all circumstances.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html">468 U. S. 897</a></span> (1984); <em>United States v.

Calandra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html">414 U. S. 338</a></span> (1974).  Rather, our decisions concerning the scope of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule have balanced the benefits of deterring police misconduct against the costs of excluding reliable evidence of criminal activity.  <em>See Leon,</em> 468 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#908">468 U. S. 908</a></span>-913.  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 486 U. S. 45</a></p><p> have declined to apply the exclusionary rule indiscriminately "when law enforcement officers have acted in objective good faith or their transgressions have been minor," because</p>\n<p>"the magnitude of the benefit conferred on . . . guilty defendants [in such circumstances] offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#908">468 U.

Record 113.  Complete strangers minutely scrutinized their bounty, undoubtedly dredging up intimate details of Greenwood\'s private life and habits.  The intrusions proceeded without a warrant, and no court before or since has concluded that the police acted on probable cause to believe Greenwood was engaged in any criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Scrutiny of another\'s trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.  I suspect, therefore, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 486 U.

Thus, as the Court observes, if Greenwood had a reasonable expectatlon that the contents of the bags that he placed on the curb would remain private, the warrantless search of those bags violated the Fourth Amendment.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/35/case.html#39">486 U. S. 39</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Framers of the Fourth Amendment understood that "unreasonable searches" of "paper[s] and effects" -- no less than "unreasonable searches" of "person[s] and houses" -- infringe privacy.  As early as 1878, this Court acknowledged that the contents of</p>\n<p>"[l]etters and sealed packages . . . in the mail are as fully guarded from examination and inspection . . . as if they were retained by the parties forwarding them in their own domiciles."</p>\n<p><em>Ex parte Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/727/case.html">96 U.

In short, so long as a package is "closed against inspection," the Fourth Amendment protects its contents, "wherever they may be," and the police must obtain a warrant to search it just "as is required when papers are subjected to search in one\'s own household."  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>Accord, United States v.

Similarly, had police searching the city dump run across incriminating evidence that, despite commingling with the trash of others, still retained its identity as Greenwood\'s, we would have a different case.  But all that Greenwood "exposed . . . to the public," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/35/case.html#40">486 U. S. 40</a></span>, were the exteriors of several opaque, sealed containers.  Until the bags were opened by police, they hid their contents from the public\'s view every bit as much as did Chadwick\'s double-locked footlocker and Robbins\' green plastic wrapping.  Faithful application of the warrant requirement does not require police to "avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public."  Rather, it only requires them </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 486 U. S. 54</a></p><p> to adhere to norms of privacy that members of the public plainly acknowledge.</p>\n<p>The mere <em>possibility</em> that unwelcome meddlers might open and rummage through the containers does not negate the expectation of privacy in their contents any more than the possibility of a burglary negates an expectation of privacy in the home; or the possibility of a private intrusion negates an expectation of privacy in an unopened package; or the possibility that an operator will listen in on a telephone conversation negates an expectation of privacy in the words spoken on the telephone.  "What a person . . . seeks to preserve as private, <em>even in an area aceessible to the public,</em> may be constitutionally protected."  <em>Katz,</em> 389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#351">389 U.

Unlike in other circumstances where privacy is compromised, Greenwood could not "avoid exposing personal belongings . . . by simply leaving them at home."  <em>O\'Connor, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/709/case.html#725">480 U.

Were it otherwise, a letter or package would lose all Fourth Amendment protection when placed in a mailbox or other depository with the "express purpose" of entrusting it to the postal officer or a private carrier; those bailees are just as likely as trash collectors (and certainly have greater incentive) to "sor[t] through" the personal effects entrusted to them, "or permi[t] others, such as police to do so."  Yet it has been clear for at least 110 years that the possibility of such an intrusion does not justify a warrantless search by police in the first instance.  <em>See Ex parte Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/727/case.html">96 U.
