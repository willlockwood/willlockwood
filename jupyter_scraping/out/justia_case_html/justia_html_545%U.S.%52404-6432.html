After petitioner abandoned his attempt to seek review of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, this Court decided that a state postconviction relief petition can toll the federal statute of limitations even if, like petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s, the petition is ultimately dismissed as procedurally barred.  <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a>.  Petitioner filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the judgment, which the District Court denied.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the denial, holding that the Rule 60(b) motion was in substance a second or successive habeas petition, which under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b), cannot be filed without precertification by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion challenged only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous ruling on AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, it is not the equivalent of a successive habeas petition and can be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Eleventh Circuit.

Because \xc2\xa72244(b) applies only where a court acts pursuant to a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application,\xe2\x80\x9d the question here is whether a Rule 60(b) motion is such an application.  The text of \xc2\xa72244(b) shows that, for these purposes, a habeas application is a filing containing one or more \xe2\x80\x9cclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Other federal habeas statutes and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions also make clear that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state-court conviction.  If a Rule 60(b) motion contains one or more \xe2\x80\x9cclaims,\xe2\x80\x9d the motion is, if not in substance a \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application,\xe2\x80\x9d at least similar enough that failing to subject it to AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on successive habeas petitions would be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the statute.  A Rule 60(b) motion can be said to bring a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d if it seeks to add a new ground for relief from the state conviction or attacks the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s previous resolution of a claim on the merits</em>, though not if it merely attacks a defect in the federal habeas proceedings\xe2\x80\x99 integrity.

If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed on its own terms creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, fits this description.  Nothing in <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/538/index.html">523 U.

The question presented is whether, in a habeas case, such motions are subject to the additional restrictions that apply to \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d habeas corpus petitions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Aurelio Gonzalez pleaded guilty in Florida Circuit Court to one count of robbery with a firearm.  He filed no appeal and began serving his 99-year sentence in 1982.  Some 12 years later, petitioner began to seek relief from his conviction.  He filed two motions for state postconviction relief, which the Florida courts denied.  Thereafter, in June 1997, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition in the United\xc2\xa0States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that his guilty plea had not been entered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the District Court dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition as barred by AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d).  Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadline, absent tolling, was April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations took effect.  <em>Wilcox</em> v. <em>Florida Dept. of Corrections,</em> 158 F.\xc2\xa03d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Adopting a Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, the District Court concluded that the limitations period was not tolled during the 163-day period while petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second motion for state postconviction relief was pending.  Section 2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d applications only, and the District Court thought petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion was not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d because it was both untimely and successive.  Without tolling, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition was two months late, so the District Court dismissed it as time barred.  A judge of the Eleventh Circuit denied a certificate of appealability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and petitioner did not file for rehearing or review of that decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 7, 2000, we held in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a>, that an application for state postconviction relief can be \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d even if the state courts dismiss it as procedurally barred.  See <em>id.,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Almost nine months later, petitioner filed in the District Court a <em>pro se</em> \xe2\x80\x9cMotion to Amend or Alter Judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d contending that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s time-bar ruling was incorrect under <em>Artuz</em>\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa72244(d), and invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), which permits a court to relieve a party from the effect of a final judgment.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The District Court denied the motion, and petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certificate as improvidently granted.  317 F.\xc2\xa03d 1308, 1310, 1314 (2003).  The full court vacated that order and reheard the case en banc.  It granted petitioner a COA but held, by a vote of 7 to 4, that the District Court was correct to deny his Rule 60(b) motion.  The en banc majority determined that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion\xe2\x80\x94indeed, any postjudgment motion under Rule 60(b) save one alleging fraud on the court under Rule 60(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x94was in substance a second or successive habeas corpus petition.  366 F.\xc2\xa03d 1253, 1278, 1281\xe2\x80\x931282 (2004).  A state prisoner may not file such a petition without precertification by the court of appeals that the petition meets certain stringent criteria.  \xc2\xa72244(b).  Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion did not satisfy these requirements, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1282.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. __ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Rule 60(b)(6), the particular provision under which petitioner brought his motion, permits reopening when the movant shows \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d other than the more specific circumstances set out in Rules 60(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  See <em>Liljeberg</em> v. <em>Health Services Acquisition Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/847/index.html">486 U. S. 847</a>, 863, n.\xc2\xa011 (1988); <em>Klapprott</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/601/index.html">335 U. S. 601</a>, 613 (1949) (opinion of Black, J.).  The mere recitation of these provisions shows why we give little weight to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the virtues of finality.  That policy consideration, standing alone, is unpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision whose whole purpose is to make an exception to finality.  The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of some other provision of law, limits its application in a manner relevant to the case before us.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AEDPA did not expressly circumscribe the operation of Rule 60(b).  (By contrast, AEDPA directly amended other provisions of the Federal Rules.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> AEDPA, \xc2\xa7103, 110 Stat. 1218 (amending Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).)  The new habeas restrictions introduced by AEDPA are made indirectly relevant, however, by the fact that Rule 60(b), like the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies in habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] only \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d applicable federal statutory provisions and rules.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 Rule 11; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2).  The relevant provisions of the AEDPA-amended habeas statutes, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), impose three requirements on second or successive habeas petitions: First, any claim that has already been adjudicated in a previous petition must be dismissed.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(1).  Second, any claim that has <em>not</em> already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  Third, before the district court may accept a successive petition for filing, the court of appeals must determine that it presents a claim not previously raised that is sufficient to meet \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s new-rule or actual-innocence provisions.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(3).  We proceed to consider whether these provisions limit the application of Rule 60(b) to the present case.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs a textual matter, \xc2\xa72244(b) applies only where the court acts pursuant to a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98application\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for a writ of habeas corpus.  <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/538/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/538/index.html">523 U. S. 538</a>, 554 (1998).  We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application\xe2\x80\x9d as the statute uses that term.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa72244(b), the first step of analysis is to determine whether a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\xe2\x80\x9d was also \xe2\x80\x9cpresented in a prior application.\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the analysis proceeds to whether the claim satisfies one of two narrow exceptions.  In either event, it is clear that for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(b) an \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more \xe2\x80\x9cclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d  That definition is consistent with the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d in the other habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Garceau, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/202/index.html">538 U. S. 202</a>, 207 (2003) (for purposes of \xc2\xa72254(d), an application for habeas corpus relief is a filing that seeks \xe2\x80\x9can adjudication on the<em> merits</em> of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  These statutes, and our own decisions, make clear that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa72244(b) is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some instances, a Rule 60(b) motion will contain one or more \xe2\x80\x9cclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, it might straightforwardly assert that owing to \xe2\x80\x9cexcusable neglect,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), the movant\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition had omitted a claim of constitutional error, and seek leave to present that claim.  Cf. <em>Harris</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 367 F.\xc2\xa03d 74, 80\xe2\x80\x9381 (CA2 2004) (petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from judgment because habeas counsel had failed to raise a Sixth Amendment claim).  Similarly, a motion might seek leave to present \xe2\x80\x9cnewly discovered evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously denied.  <em>E.g., Rodwell</em> v. <em>Pepe,</em> 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 66, 69 (CA1 2003)<em>.</em>  Or a motion might contend that a subsequent change in substantive law is a \xe2\x80\x9creason justifying relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Dunlap</em> v. <em>Litscher</em>, 301 F.\xc2\xa03d 873, 876 (CA7 2002).  Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that such a pleading, although labeled a Rule 60(b) motion, is in substance a successive habeas petition and should be treated accordingly.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Rodwell, supra,</em> at 71\xe2\x80\x9372; <em>Dunlap, supra,</em> at 876.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think those holdings are correct.  A habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s filing that seeks vindication of such a claim is, if not in substance a \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application,\xe2\x80\x9d at least similar enough that failing to subject it to the same requirements would be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the statute.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 Rule 11.  Using Rule 60(b) to present new claims for relief from a state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of conviction\xe2\x80\x94even claims couched in the language of a true Rule 60(b) motion\xe2\x80\x94circumvents AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a new claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered facts.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion presenting new evidence in support of a claim already litigated: even assuming that reliance on a new factual predicate causes that motion to escape \xc2\xa72244(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of claims \xe2\x80\x9cpresented in a prior application,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) requires a more convincing factual showing than does Rule 60(b).  Likewise, a Rule 60(b) motion based on a purported change in the substantive law governing the claim could be used to circumvent \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s dictate that the only new law on which a successive petition may rely is \xe2\x80\x9ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  In addition to the substantive conflict with AEDPA standards, in each of these three examples use of Rule 60(b) would impermissibly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas petition be precertified by the court of appeals as falling within an exception to the successive-petition bar.  \xc2\xa72244(b)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In most cases, determining whether a Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d will be relatively simple.  A motion that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in <em>Harris, supra,</em> will of course qualify.  A motion can also be said to bring a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d if it attacks the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s previous resolution of a claim <em>on the merits</em>,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] since alleging that the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits is effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the substantive provisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief.  That is not the case, however, when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When no \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is presented, there is no basis for contending that the Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas corpus application.  If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion in the present case, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limitations set out in \xc2\xa72244(d), fits this description.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, respondent relies heavily on our decision in <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/538/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/538/index.html">523 U. S. 538</a> (1998).  In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s first federal habeas petition; the recall was, we held, an abuse of discretion because of its inconsistency with the policies embodied in AEDPA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 554\xe2\x80\x93559.  Analogizing an appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s recall of its mandate to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of relief from judgment, the Eleventh Circuit thought that <em>Calderon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s disposition applied to Rule 60(b).  366 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1272\xe2\x80\x931277.  We think otherwise.  To begin with, as the opinion said, compliance with the actual text of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s successive-petition provision was not at issue in <em>Calderon</em>\xe2\x80\x94because the Court of Appeals considered only the claims and evidence presented in Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s first federal habeas petition.  523 U. S.,<em> </em>at 554.  <em>Calderon</em> did state, however, that \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to recall the mandate <em>on</em> <em>the basis of the</em> <em>merits</em> of the underlying decision can be regarded as a second or successive application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 553 (emphasis added).  But that is entirely consonant with the proposition that a Rule 60(b) motion that seeks to revisit the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s denial <em>on the merits</em> of a claim for relief should be treated as a successive habeas petition.  The problem for respondent is that this case does not present a revisitation <em>of the merits.</em>  The motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in \xc2\xa72254 cases, confines itself not only to the first federal habeas petition, but to a nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceeding.  Nothing in <em>Calderon</em> suggests that entertaining such a filing is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d AEDPA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 60(b) has an unquestionably valid role to play in habeas cases.  The Rule is often used to relieve parties from the effect of a default judgment mistakenly entered against them, <em>e.g., Klapprott,</em> 335 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Black, J.), a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mine civil cases.  The Rule also preserves parties\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to obtain vacatur of a judgment that is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94a consideration just as valid in habeas cases as in any other, since absence of jurisdiction altogether deprives a federal court of the power to adjudicate the rights of the parties.  <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U. S. 83</a>, 94, 101 (1998).  In some instances, we may note, it is the State, not the habeas petitioner, that seeks to use Rule 60(b), to reopen a habeas judgment <em>granting</em> the writ.  See, <em>e.g., Ritter</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> 811 F.\xc2\xa02d 1398, 1400 (CA11 1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, several characteristics of a Rule 60(b) motion limit the friction between the Rule and the successive-petition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our harmonization of the two will not expose federal courts to an avalanche of frivolous postjudgment motions.  First, Rule 60(b) contains its own limitations, such as the requirement that the motion \xe2\x80\x9cbe made within a reasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d and the more specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of the most open-ended grounds of relief (excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud).  Second, our cases have required a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d justifying the reopening of a final judgment.  <em>Ackermann</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/193/index.html">340 U. S. 193</a>, 199 (1950); accord, <em>id.,</em> at 202; <em>Liljeberg,</em> 486 U. S., at 864; <em>id.,</em> at 873 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.  Third, Rule 60(b) proceedings are subject to only limited and deferential appellate review.  <em>Browder</em> v. <em>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/257/index.html">434 U. S. 257</a>, 263, n.\xc2\xa07 (1978).  Many Courts of Appeals have construed 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253 to impose an additional limitation on appellate review by requiring a habeas petitioner to obtain a COA as a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion challenges only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous ruling on the AEDPA statute of limitations, it is not the equivalent of a successive habeas petition.  The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in holding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is inconsistent with our holding today, we nonetheless affirm its denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s only ground for reopening the judgment denying his first federal habeas petition is that our decision in <em>Artuz</em> showed the error of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s statute-of-limitations ruling.  We assume for present purposes that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was incorrect.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As we noted above, however, relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\xe2\x80\x94the only subsection petitioner invokes\xe2\x80\x94requires a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner contends that <em>Artuz</em>\xe2\x80\x99s change in the interpretation of the AEDPA statute of limitations meets this description.  We do not agree.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was by all appearances correct under the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s then-prevailing interpretation of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  It is hardly extraordinary that subsequently, after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived at a different interpretation.  Although our constructions of federal statutes customarily apply to all cases then pending on direct review, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Harper</em> v. <em>Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/86/index.html">509 U. S. 86</a>, 97 (1993), not every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  If <em>Artuz</em> justified reopening long-ago dismissals based on a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s unduly parsimonious interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), then <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo,</em> 544 U. S. __ (2005), would justify reopening long-ago grants of habeas relief based on a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s unduly <em>generous</em> interpretation of the same tolling provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The change in the law worked by <em>Artuz</em> is all the less extraordinary in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case, because of his lack of diligence in pursuing review of the statute-of-limitations issue.  At the time <em>Artuz</em> was decided, petitioner had abandoned any attempt to seek review of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on this statute-of-limitations issue.  Although the District Court relied on Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a state postconviction application is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d if it is procedurally defaulted, and although that precedent was at odds with the rule in several other Circuits, petitioner neither raised that issue in his application for a COA, nor filed a petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a COA, nor sought certiorari review of that denial.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  This lack of diligence confirms that <em>Artuz</em> is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Indeed, in one of the cases in which we explained Rule 60(b)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary-circumstances requirement, the movant had failed to appeal an adverse ruling by the District Court, whereas another party to the same judgment had appealed and won reversal.  <em>Ackermann,</em> 340 U. S., at 195.  Some years later, the petitioner sought Rule 60(b) relief, which the District Court denied.  We affirmed the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, noting that the movant\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to appeal had been free and voluntary, although the favorable ruling in the companion case made it appear mistaken in hindsight.  See <em>id.,</em> at 198.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Rule 60(b) standards that properly govern petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the District Court was correct to deny relief.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \xc2\xa72254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does not assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction.  A motion that, like petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s, challenges only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to \xc2\xa72244(b)(3).  In this case, however, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b)(6) motion fails to set forth an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d justifying relief.

Federal prisoners generally seek postconviction relief under \xc2\xa72255, which contains its own provision governing second or successive applications.  Although that portion of \xc2\xa72255 is similar to, and refers to, the statutory subsection applicable to second or successive \xc2\xa72254 petitions, it is not identical.  Accordingly, we limit our consideration to \xc2\xa72254 cases.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d has multiple usages.

We refer here to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(a) and (d).  When a movant asserts one of those grounds (or asserts that a previous ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is making a habeas corpus claim.  He is not doing so when he merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error\xe2\x80\x94for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Fraud on the federal habeas court is one example of such a defect.

We note that an attack based on the movant\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct, or his habeas counsel\xe2\x80\x99s omissions, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 6, ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the merits determined favorably.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner notes that we held in <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U.

But see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Murray</em> v. <em>Greiner,</em> 394 F.\xc2\xa03d 78, 81 (CA2 2005).

Although we do not decide in this case whether this construction of \xc2\xa72253 is correct (the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA), the COA requirement appears to be a more plausible and effective screening requirement, with sounder basis in the statute, than the near-absolute bar imposed here by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although respondent contends that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for state postconviction relief was untimely, and that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of statutory tolling was therefore correct under <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo,</em> 544 U.

Not only do I agree with that holding, I believe that we should have more promptly made clear that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and Rule 60(b) can coexist in harmony.   See <em>Abdur\xe2\x80\x99Rahman</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/88/index.html">537 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 8.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]   Given the substance of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, I agree with the Court that this was a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 60(b) motion and that the District Court and the Court of Appeals therefore erred in treating it as a successive habeas petition.  And while I also agree with much of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in Parts I and II of its opinion, I believe the Court goes too far in commenting on issues that are not directly before us and that have not been fully briefed.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (discussing various court of appeals cases).  My main disagreement, however, pertains to Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches beyond the question on which we granted certiorari (whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion should be treated as a successive habeas petition) and adjudicates the merits of that motion.   In my judgment, however, \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect procedure requires that the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Abdur\xe2\x80\x99Rahman</em>, 537 U. S., at 97 (Stevens, J., dissenting).   A district court considering a Rule 60(b) motion will often take into account a variety of factors in addition to the specific ground given for reopening the judgment.  These factors include the diligence of the movant, the probable merit of the movant\xe2\x80\x99s underlying claims, the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s reliance interests in the finality of the judgment, and other equitable considerations.   See 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa72857 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2004) see <em>ibid. </em>(noting that appellate courts will reverse a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision only for an abuse of discretion); <em>Plaut </em>v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/211/index.html">514 U.

In light of the equitable, often fact-intensive nature of the Rule 60(b) inquiry, it is inappropriate for an appellate court to undertake it in the first instance.

After that judgment became final, however, we decided <em>Artuz </em>v. <em>Bennett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a> (2000), which made clear that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on tolling was erroneous and that the habeas petition should therefore not have been dismissed.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the Court underestimates the significance of the fact that petitioner was effectively shut out of federal court\xe2\x80\x94without any adjudication of the merits of his claims\xe2\x80\x94because of a procedural ruling that was later shown to be flatly mistaken.   As we have stressed,  \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ismissal of a <em>first </em>federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ entirely, risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lonchar </em>v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/314/index.html">517 U. S. 314</a>, 324 (1996); see also <em>Slack </em>v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 483 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  When a habeas petition has been dismissed on a clearly defective procedural ground, the State can hardly claim a legitimate interest in the finality of that judgment.  Indeed, the State has experienced a windfall, while the state prisoner has been deprived\xe2\x80\x94contrary to congressional intent\xe2\x80\x94of his valuable right to one full round of federal habeas review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this type of supervening change in procedural law may not alone warrant the reopening of a habeas judgment, there may be special factors that allow a prisoner to satisfy the high standard of Rule 60(b)(6).  For instance, when a prisoner has shown reasonable diligence in seeking relief based on a change in procedural law, and when that prisoner can show that there is probable merit to his underlying claims, it would be well in keeping with a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion under Rule 60(b)(6) for that court to reopen the habeas judgment and give the prisoner the one fair shot at habeas review that Congress intended that he have.  After all, we have consistently recognized that Rule 60(b)(6) \xe2\x80\x9cprovides courts with authority \xe2\x80\x98adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever  such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Liljeberg </em>v. <em>Health Services Acquisition Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/847/index.html">486 U. S. 847</a>, 864 (1988) (quoting <em>Klapprott </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/601/index.html">335 U. S. 601</a>, 614\xe2\x80\x93615 (1949)).  Here, petitioner, who is serving a 99-year term in Florida prison, filed his Rule 60(b) motion approximately eight months after this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Artuz</em>.   A district court could reasonably conclude that this period reveals no lack of diligence on the part of an incarcerated <em>pro se </em>litigant.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And while we have received scant briefing on the probable merit of his petition,  his allegation\xe2\x80\x94that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because it was based on grossly inaccurate advice about the actual time he would serve in prison\xe2\x80\x94at least states a colorable claim of a constitutional violation.  See <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Vaughn</em>, 67 F. 3d 909 (CA11 1995); see also <em>Mabry </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/504/index.html">467 U. S. 504</a> (1984).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s supposed lack of diligence in pursuing review of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s initial statute-of-limitations ruling.   See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 12.  In fact, petitioner did appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, which the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted as a request for a certificate of appealability (COA).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to seek rehearing or certiorari, he alleged in his Rule 60(b) motion, App. 16, and again in his reply brief, that he filed a timely petition for rehearing on April 18, 2000, but that the clerk of the Court of Appeals returned the motion unfiled, \xe2\x80\x9cexplaining, erroneously, that his appeal was dismissed and closed on October 28, 1999.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 13 (emphasis deleted).  According to petitioner,  \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his official misinformation carried the weight of a court decision and was enough to convince a <em>pro se </em>litigant (and some lawyers) that the 90-day window for filing a certiorari petition expired, as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The State, however, represents that petitioner erroneously filed the petition for rehearing under the case number of an earlier, dismissed appeal.  Brief for Respondent 4.  I do not know how to resolve these allegations, but this only highlights the propriety of a remand.  Even on the State\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at filing for rehearing is proof of diligence on his part.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Putting these allegations aside, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is too parsimonious.  While petitioner could have shown even greater diligence by seeking rehearing for a second time and then filing for certiorari, we have never held <em>pro se </em>prisoners to the standards of counseled litigants.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/519/index.html">404 U. S. 519</a> (1972) (per curiam).  Indeed, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s situation contrasts dramatically with that of the movant in the case the Court relies on, <em>Ackermann </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/193/index.html"></a><a href="/us/340/193/index.html">340 U. S. 193</a> (1950).  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  In upholding the denial of Rule 60(b)(6) relief in <em>Ackermann</em>, the Court put great emphasis on the fact that the movant had the benefit of paid counsel and that, for much of the relevant period, he was not detained, but rather enjoyed \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of movement and action,\xe2\x80\x9d  340 U. S., at 201.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In any event, I believe that our rules governing prisoner litigation should favor a policy of repose rather than a policy that encourages multiple filings with a low probability of success.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that petitioner filed a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 60(b) motion.  I respectfully dissent, however, because of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to rule on the merits of the motion in the first instance.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s useful formulation, which was invoked by Judge Tjoflat\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion below, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the motions\xe2\x80\x99 factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying state conviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition.  This situation should be distinguished from one in which the motion\xe2\x80\x99s factual predicate deals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the procurement of the judgment denying relief.  That is the classic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, and such a motion should be treated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rodwell </em>v. <em>Pepe</em>, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 66, 70 (2003) (citation omitted); see also 366 F. 3d 1253, 1297 (CA 11 2004) (Tjoflat, J., opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the State contests this point in a footnote, see Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9341, n. 33, the Court rightly assumes that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was incorrect.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11, and n. 8.  If any doubt remains, it should be resolved by the District Court in the first\ninstance.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0While Rule 60(b)(6) contains no specific time limitation on filing, it is worth noting that petitioner filed his motion within the strict 1-year limitation that applies to motions under Rules 60(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is also worth noting that <em>Artuz</em> v.<em> Bennett, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a> (2000),<em> </em>was decided only seven months after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas judgment became final.  In cases where significant time has elapsed between a habeas judgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to leave such a judgment in repose.  </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See Fed.

The procedural route that petitioner navigated was actually more complicated.  After the Magistrate Judge initially recommended dismissal of the petition as time barred, petitioner filed an objection that raised a Third Circuit case, <em>Lovasz </em>v. <em>Vaughn</em>, 134 F.\xc2\xa03d 146 (1998), which was among the circuit cases that was later endorsed by <em>Artuz</em>, 531 U. S., at 8.  The Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s final report noted that the Eleventh Circuit had not addressed the relevant issue of tolling, and then proceeded to rely (oddly) on <em>Lovasz </em>to deny petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  In my view, the citation to <em>Lovasz </em>and the Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment that there was no Eleventh Circuit precedent on point provided a reasonable basis for the granting of a COA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, on September 23, 1998, petitioner filed an application for a COA, and this application was granted by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal on October 28, 1999, and remanded the COA for a determination of which specific issues merited permission to appeal.  On remand, petitioner filed a new application for a COA, but this time the District Court denied the request.  Petitioner then filed a timely appeal, and the District Court granted his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal.  The Court of Appeals then declined to issue a COA and dismissed the appeal on April 6, 2000.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>Ackermann </em>is further distinguishable in that it did not involve the sort of plain error of law that has been identified in this case.  But even if <em>Ackermann </em>were not distinguishable, I would find the views expressed by Justices Black, Frankfurter, and Douglas in dissent, see 340 U. S. at 202 (opinion of Black, J.), more persuasive than those expressed by Justice Minton.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A petition for certiorari seeking review of a denial of a COA has an objectively low chance of being granted.  Such a decision is not thought to present a good vehicle for resolving legal issues, and error-correction is a disfavored basis for granting review, particularly in noncapital cases.  See generally this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10.  As for the fact that this Court granted certiorari in <em>Artuz </em>eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA, it would be unrealistic to fault petitioner for failing to capitalize on this fortuity.  In my experience, even lower courts and counseled litigants are often not aware of our grants of certiorari on issues that may be relevant to their current business.  It would be particularly inappropriate to impose such a strict expectation on a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, particularly in the absence of any indication of when, given his circumstances in prison, he could have reasonably been expected to learn of our grant in Artuz.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
