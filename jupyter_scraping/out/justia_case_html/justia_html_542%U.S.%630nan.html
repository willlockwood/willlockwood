Argued December 9, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 28, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">After Officer Fox began to investigate respondent\xe2\x80\x99s apparent violation of a temporary restraining order, a federal agent told Fox\xe2\x80\x99s colleague, Detective Benner, that respondent, a convicted felon, illegally possessed a pistol.  Officer Fox and Detective Benner proceeded to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s home, where Fox arrested him for violating the restraining order.<font super="-1">  Benner attempted to advise respondent of his rights under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, but respondent interrupted, asserting that he knew his rights.  Benner then asked about the pistol and retrieved and seized it.  Respondent was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  The District Court granted his motion to suppress the pistol, reasoning that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him, and declining to rule on his alternative argument that the gun should be suppressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement.  The Tenth Circuit reversed the probable-cause ruling, but affirmed the suppression order on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative theory.  Rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

S. 471</a>, 488, to the present context, the appeals court reasoned that <em>Oregon</em> and <em>Tucker</em>, which were based on the view that <em>Miranda</em> announced a prophylactic rule, were incompatible with <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 444, in which this Court held that <em>Miranda</em> announced a constitutional rule.  The appeals court thus equated <em>Dickerson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s ruling with the proposition that a failure to warn pursuant to <em>Miranda</em> is itself a violation of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment rights.  </font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">304 F.\xc2\xa03d 1013, reversed and remanded. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, concluded that a failure to give a suspect <em>Miranda</em> warnings does not require suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned but voluntary statements.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The <em>Miranda</em> rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, U. S.Const., Amdt. 5.  That Clause\xe2\x80\x99s core protection is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chavez</em> v. <em>Martinez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/760/index.html">538 U. S. 760</a>, 764\xe2\x80\x93768.   It cannot be violated by the introduction of nontestimonial evidence obtained as a result of voluntary statements.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v.  <em>Hubbell, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/27/index.html">530 U. S. 27</a>, 34.  The Court has recognized and applied several prophylactic rules designed to protect the core privilege against self-incrimination.  For example, the <em>Miranda</em> rule creates a presumption of coercion in custodial interrogations, in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief.  <em>E.g.,</em> 384 U. S., at 467.  But because such prophylactic rules necessarily sweep beyond the Self-Incrimination Clause\xe2\x80\x99s actual protections, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/index.html">507 U. S. 680</a>, 690\xe2\x80\x93691, any further extension of one of them must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-incrimination, <em>e.g., Chavez, supra, </em>at 778.  Thus, uncompelled statements taken without <em>Miranda</em> warnings can be used to impeach a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at trial, see <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308, though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see <em>New Jersey</em> v. <em>Portash,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/450/index.html">440 U. S. 450</a>, 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  A blanket rule requiring suppression of statements noncompliant with the <em>Miranda</em> rule could not be justified by reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cFifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence\xe2\x80\x9d or by any deterrence rationale, <em>e.g., Elstad</em>, 470 U. S., at 308, and would therefore fail the Court\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the closest possible fit be maintained between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any rule designed to protect it.  Furthermore, the Clause contains its own exclusionary rule that automatically protects those subjected to coercive police interrogations from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent criminal trial.  <em>E.g., id., </em>at 307\xe2\x80\x93308.  This explicit textual protection supports a strong presumption against expanding the <em>Miranda</em> rule any further.  Cf. <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U. S. 386</a>.  Finally, nothing in <em>Dickerson </em>calls into question the Court\xe2\x80\x99s continued insistence on its close-fit requirement.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0That a mere failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings does not, by itself, violate a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights or even the <em>Miranda</em> rule was evident in many of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-<em>Dickerson</em> cases, see, <em>e.g., Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 308, and the Court has adhered to that view since <em>Dickerson, </em>see<em> Chavez, supra, at </em>772\xe2\x80\x93773.    This follows from the nature of the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental <em>trial</em> right\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause, <em>e.g., Withrow, supra</em>, at 691, which the <em>Miranda</em> rule, in turn, protects.  Thus, the police do not violate a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights (or the <em>Miranda</em> rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide full <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  Potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the admission of unwarned statements into evidence.  And, at that point, the exclusion of such statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived <em>Miranda</em> violation.  <em>Chavez, supra</em>, at 790.  Unlike actual violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect to mere failures to warn, nothing to deter and therefore no reason to apply <em>Wong Sun</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfruit of the poisonous tree\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.  It is not for this Court to impose its preferred police practices on either federal or state officials.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit erred in ruling that the taking of unwarned statements violates a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.  <em>Dickerson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Miranda</em> as a constitutional rule does not lessen the need to maintain the close-fit requirement.  There is no such fit here.  Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement, such as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pistol, does not implicate the Clause.  It presents no risk that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s coerced statements (however defined) will be used against him at a criminal trial.  In any case, the exclusion of unwarned statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived <em>Miranda</em> violation.  <em>E.g., Chavez, supra</em>, at 790.  Similarly, because police cannot violate the Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the court below believed.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d in the constitutional text limits the Self-Incrimination Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope to testimonial evidence.  <em>Hubbell, supra, </em>at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  And although the Court requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually coerced statements, statements taken without sufficient <em>Miranda</em> warnings are presumed to have been coerced only for certain purposes and then only when necessary to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.  This Court declines to extend that presumption further.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, concluded that it is unnecessary to decide whether the detective\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give Patane full <em>Miranda</em> warnings should be characterized as a violation of the <em>Miranda </em>rule itself, or whether there is anything to deter so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial.  In <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a>, and <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/index.html">401 U. S. 222</a>, evidence obtained following unwarned interrogations was held admissible based in large part on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that the concerns underlying the <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, rule must be accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice system.  Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even stronger case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of Patane\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned statement than was presented in <em>Elstad</em> and <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tucker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/index.html"></a><a href="/us/417/433/index.html">417 U. S. 433</a>.  Admission of nontestimonial physical fruits (the pistol here) does not run the risk of admitting into trial an accused\xe2\x80\x99s coerced incriminating statements against himself.  In light of reliable physical evidence\xe2\x80\x99s important probative value, it is doubtful that exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to both law enforcement interests and a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights during an in-custody interrogation.

S. 436</a> (1966), requires suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned but voluntary statements.  The Court has previously addressed this question but has not reached a definitive conclusion.  See <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>White,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/280/index.html">439 U. S. 280</a> (1978) <em>(per curiam)</em> (dividing evenly on the question); see also <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/922/index.html">485 U.

Although we believe that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

S. 433</a> (1974), are instructive, the Courts of Appeals have split on the question after our decision in <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a> (2000).  See, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Villalba-Alvarado</em>, 345 F.\xc2\xa03d 1007 (CA8 2003) (holding admissible the physical fruits of a <em>Miranda</em> violation); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sterling</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 216 (CA4 2002) (same); <em>United States</em> v. <em>DeSumma</em>, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 176 (CA3 2001) (same); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Faulkingham</em>, 295 F.\xc2\xa03d 85 (CA1 2002) (holding admissible the physical fruits of a negligent <em>Miranda</em> violation).  Because the <em>Miranda</em> rule protects against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, which, in turn, is not implicated by the introduction at trial of physical evidence resulting from voluntary statements, we answer the question presented in the negative.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In June 2001, respondent, Samuel Francis Patane, was arrested for harassing his ex-girlfriend, Linda O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell.  He was released on bond, subject to a temporary restraining order that prohibited him from contacting O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell.  Respondent apparently violated the restraining order by attempting to telephone O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell.  On June 6, 2001, Officer Tracy Fox of the Colorado Springs Police Department began to investigate the matter.  On the same day, a county probation officer informed an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), that respondent, a convicted felon, illegally possessed a .40 Glock pistol.  The ATF relayed this information to Detective Josh Benner, who worked closely with the ATF.  Together, Detective Benner and Officer Fox proceeded to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s residence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reaching the residence and inquiring into respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to contact O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, Officer Fox arrested respondent for violating the restraining order.<font super="-1">  Detective Benner attempted to advise respondent of his <em>Miranda</em> rights but got no further than the right to remain silent.  At that point, respondent interrupted, asserting that he knew his rights, and neither officer attempted to complete the warning.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. 40.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Detective Benner then asked respondent about the Glock.  Respondent was initially reluctant to discuss the matter, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure I should tell you anything about the Glock because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to take it away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 41.  Detective Benner persisted, and respondent told him that the pistol was in his bedroom.  Respondent then gave Detective Benner permission to retrieve the pistol.  Detective Benner found the pistol and seized it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A grand jury indicted respondent for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  The District Court granted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress the firearm, reasoning that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest respondent for violating the restraining order.  It therefore declined to rule on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that the gun should be suppressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling with respect to probable cause but affirmed the suppression order on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative theory.  The court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Elstad,</em> <em>supra</em>, and <em>Tucker,</em> <em>supra</em>, foreclosed application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine of <em>Wong Sun</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/471/index.html">371 U. S. 471</a> (1963), to the present context.  304 F.\xc2\xa03d 1013, 1019 (CA10 2002).  These holdings were, the Court of Appeals reasoned, based on the view that <em>Miranda</em> announced a prophylactic rule, a position that it found to be incompatible with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Dickerson, supra,</em> at 444 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Miranda</em> announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals thus equated <em>Dickerson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that <em>Miranda</em> is a constitutional rule with the proposition that a failure to warn pursuant to <em>Miranda</em> is itself a violation of the Constitution (and, more particularly, of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment rights).  Based on its understanding of <em>Dickerson</em>, the Court of Appeals rejected the post-<em>Dickerson</em> views of the Third and Fourth Circuits that the fruits doctrine does not apply to <em>Miranda</em> violations.  304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1023\xe2\x80\x931027 (discussing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sterling</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 216 (CA4 2002), and <em>United States</em> v. <em>DeSumma</em>, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 176 (CA3 2001)).  It also disagreed with the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that suppression is not generally required in the case of negligent failures to warn, 304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1027\xe2\x80\x931029 (discussing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Faulkingham</em>, 295 F.\xc2\xa03d 85 (CA1 2002)), explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eterrence is necessary not merely to deter intentional wrongdoing, but also to ensure that officers diligently (non-negligently) protect\xe2\x80\x94and properly are trained to protect\xe2\x80\x94the constitutional rights of citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d 304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1028\xe2\x80\x931029.  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/976/index.html">538 U. S. 976</a> (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explain below, the <em>Miranda</em> rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause.  The Self-Incrimination Clause, however, is not implicated by the admission into evidence of the physical fruit of a voluntary statement.  Accordingly, there is no justification for extending the <em>Miranda</em> rule to this context.  And just as the Self-Incrimination Clause primarily focuses on the criminal trial, so too does the <em>Miranda</em> rule.  The <em>Miranda</em> rule is not a code of police conduct, and police do not violate the Constitution (or\neven the <em>Miranda</em> rule, for that matter) by mere failures to warn.  For this reason, the exclusionary rule articu-\nlated in cases such as <em>Wong Sun</em> does not apply.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Self-Incrimination Clause provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo person \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.  We need not decide here the precise boundaries of the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  For present purposes, it suffices to note that the core protection afforded by the Self-Incrimination Clause is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chavez</em> v. <em>Martinez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/760/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/760/index.html">538 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chavez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 770\xe2\x80\x93772 (plurality opinion).  For example, although the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause at least suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cits coverage [is limited to] compelled testimony that is used against the defendant in the trial itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hubbell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 37, potential suspects may, at times, assert the privilege in proceedings in which answers might be used to incriminate them in a subsequent criminal case.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Balsys, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/666/index.html">524 U. S. 666</a>, 671\xe2\x80\x93672 (1998); <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Murphy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/420/index.html">465 U. S. 420</a>, 426 (1984); cf. <em>Kastigar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U. S. 441</a> (1972) (holding that the Government may compel grand jury testimony from witnesses over Fifth Amendment objections if the witnesses receive \xe2\x80\x9cuse and derivative use immunity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Commissioner of Sanitation of City of</em> <em>New York, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/280/index.html">392 U. S. 280</a>, 284 (1968) (allowing the Government to use economic compulsion to secure statements but only if the Government grants appropriate immunity).  We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he natural concern which underlies [these] decisions is that an inability to protect the right at one stage of a proceeding may make its invocation useless at a later stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tucker</em>, 417 U. S., at 440\xe2\x80\x93441.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>Miranda</em>, the Court concluded that the possibility of coercion inherent in custodial interrogations unacceptably raises the risk that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s privilege against self-incrimination might be violated.  See <em>Dickerson</em>, 530 U. S., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435; <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 467.  To protect against this danger, the <em>Miranda</em> rule creates a presumption of coercion, in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But because these prophylactic rules (including the <em>Miranda</em> rule) necessarily sweep beyond the actual protections of the Self-Incrimination Clause, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Withrow,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 690\xe2\x80\x93691; <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 306, any further extension of these rules must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-incrimination, <em>Chavez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 778 (opinion of Souter, J.) (requiring a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98powerful showing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 the privilege against compelled self-incrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, at times the Court has declined to extend <em>Miranda</em> even where it has perceived a need to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Quarles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 657 (concluding \xe2\x80\x9cthat the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s privilege against self-incrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is for these reasons that statements taken without <em>Miranda</em> warnings (though not actually compelled) can be used to impeach a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at trial, see <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308; <em>Harris</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/index.html">401 U. S. 222</a> (1971), though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see <em>New Jersey</em> v. <em>Portash,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/450/index.html">440 U. S. 450</a>, 458\xe2\x80\x93459 (1979).  More generally, the <em>Miranda</em> rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require that the statements [taken without complying with the rule] and their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Elstad</em>, 470 U. S., at 307.  Such a blanket suppression rule could not be justified by reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cFifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence\xe2\x80\x9d or by any deterrence rationale, <em>id.,</em> at 308; see <em>Tucker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 446\xe2\x80\x93449; <em>Harris</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 225\xe2\x80\x93226, and n.\xc2\xa02, and would therefore fail our close-fit requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Self-Incrimination Clause contains its own exclusionary rule.  It provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amdt. 5.  Unlike the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s bar on unreasonable searches, the Self-Incrimination Clause is self-executing.  We have repeatedly explained \xe2\x80\x9cthat those subjected to coercive police interrogations have an <em>automatic</em> protection from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chavez</em>, 538 U. S., at 769 (plurality opinion) (citing, for example, <em>Elstad, supra</em>, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308).  This explicit textual protection supports a strong presumption against expanding the <em>Miranda</em> rule any further.  Cf. <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U. S. 386</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, nothing in <em>Dickerson</em>, including its characterization of <em>Miranda</em> as announcing a constitutional rule, 530 U. S., at 444, changes any of these observations.  Indeed, in <em>Dickerson</em>, the Court specifically noted that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent cases have reduced the impact of the <em>Miranda</em> rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming [<em>Miranda</em>]\xe2\x80\x99s core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 443\xe2\x80\x93444.  This description of <em>Miranda</em>, especially the emphasis on the use of \xe2\x80\x9cunwarned statements \xe2\x80\xa6 in the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief,\xe2\x80\x9d makes clear our continued focus on the protections of the Self-Incrimination Clause.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on our <em>Miranda</em> precedents, including both <em>Tucker</em> and <em>Elstad</em>, see, <em>e.g., Dickerson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 438, 441, further demonstrates the continuing validity of those decisions.  In short, nothing in <em>Dickerson</em> calls into question our continued insistence that the closest possible fit be maintained between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any rule designed to protect it.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases also make clear the related point that a mere failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings does not, by itself, violate a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights or even the <em>Miranda</em> rule.  So much was evident in many of our pre-<em>Dickerson</em> cases, and we have adhered to this view since <em>Dickerson</em>.  See <em>Chavez,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 772\xe2\x80\x93773 (plurality opinion) (holding that a failure to read <em>Miranda</em> warnings did not violate the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights); 538 U. S., at 789. (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing \xe2\x80\x9cthat failure to give a <em>Miranda</em> warning does not, without more, establish a completed violation when the unwarned interrogation ensues\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 308; <em>Quarles</em>, 467 U. S., at 654; cf. <em>Chavez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 777\xe2\x80\x93779 (opinion of Souter, J.).  This, of course, follows from the nature of the right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause, which the <em>Miranda</em> rule, in turn, protects.  It is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a fundamental <em>trial</em> right.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em>, 507 U. S., at 691 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/259/index.html">494 U. S. 259</a>, 264 (1990)).  See also <em>Chavez,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 766\xe2\x80\x93768 (plurality opinion); <em>id</em>., at 790 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe identification of a <em>Miranda</em> violation and its consequences, then, ought to be determined at trial\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows that police do not violate a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights (or the <em>Miranda</em> rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide the suspect with the full panoply of warnings prescribed by <em>Miranda</em>.  Potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the admission of unwarned statements into evidence at trial.  And, at that point, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he exclusion of unwarned statements \xe2\x80\xa6 is a complete and sufficient remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for any perceived <em>Miranda</em> violation.  <em>Chavez, supra,</em> at 790.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, unlike unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment or actual violations of the Due Process Clause or the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect to mere failures to warn, nothing to deter.  There is therefore no reason to apply the \xe2\x80\x9cfruit of the poisonous tree\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine of <em>Wong Sun,</em> 371 U. S., at 488.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See also <em>Nix</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/431/index.html">467 U. S. 431</a>, 441 (1984) (discussing the exclusionary rule in the Sixth Amendment context and noting that it applies to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>illegally</em> obtained evidence [and] other incriminating evidence derived from [it]\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  It is not for this Court to impose its preferred police practices on either federal law enforcement officials or their state counterparts.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, the Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Dickerson</em>, wholly adopted the position that the taking of unwarned statements violates a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights. 304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1028\xe2\x80\x931029.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And, of course, if this were so, a strong deterrence-based argument could be made for suppression of the fruits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Nix</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 441\xe2\x80\x93444; <em>Wong Sun, supra</em>, at 484\xe2\x80\x93486; cf. <em>Nardone</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/338/index.html"></a><a href="/us/308/338/index.html">308 U. S. 338</a>, 341 (1939).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But <em>Dickerson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Miranda</em> as a constitutional rule does not lessen the need to maintain the closest possible fit between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any judge-made rule designed to protect it.  And there is no such fit here.  Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement, such as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Glock, does not implicate the Self-Incrimination Clause.  The admission of such fruit presents no risk that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s coerced statements (however defined) will be used against him at a criminal trial.  In any case, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he exclusion of unwarned statements \xe2\x80\xa6 is a complete and sufficient remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for any perceived <em>Miranda</em> violation.  <em>Chavez</em>, 538 U. S., at 790 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  See also H. Friendly, Benchmarks 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (1967).  There is simply no need to extend (and therefore no justification for extending) the prophylactic rule of <em>Miranda</em> to this context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, because police cannot violate the Self-Incrimination Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the Court of Appeals believed, 304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1028\xe2\x80\x931029.  Our decision not to apply <em>Wong</em> <em>Sun</em> to mere failures to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings was sound at the time <em>Tucker</em> and <em>Elstad</em> were decided, and we decline to apply <em>Wong Sun</em> to such failures now.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals ascribed significance to the fact that, in this case, there might be \xe2\x80\x9clittle [practical] difference between [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] confessional statement\xe2\x80\x9d and the actual physical evidence.  304 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1027.  The distinction, the court said, \xe2\x80\x9cappears to make little sense as a matter of policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But, putting policy aside, we have held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98witness\xe2\x80\x99 in the constitutional text limits the\xe2\x80\x9d scope of the Self-Incrimination Clause to testimonial evidence.  <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U. S., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  The Constitution itself makes the distinction.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And although it is true that the Court requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually coerced statements, it must be remembered that statements taken without sufficient <em>Miranda</em> warnings are presumed to have been coerced only for certain purposes and then only when necessary to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  For the reasons discussed above, we decline to extend that presumption further.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government concedes that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s answers to subsequent on-the-scene questioning are inadmissible at trial under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.

Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even stronger case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of Patane\xe2\x80\x99s unwarned statement.  Admission of nontestimonial physical fruits (the Glock in this case), even more so than the postwarning statements to the police in <em>Elstad</em> and <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tucker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/index.html">417 U. S. 433</a> (1974), does not run the risk of admitting into trial an accused\xe2\x80\x99s coerced incriminating statements against himself.  In light of the important probative value of reliable physical evidence, it is doubtful that exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to both law enforcement interests and a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights during an in-custody interrogation.  Unlike the plurality, however, I find it unnecessary to decide whether the detective\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give Patane the full <em>Miranda</em> warnings should be characterized as a violation of the <em>Miranda </em>rule itself, or whether there is \xe2\x80\x9c[any]thing to deter\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961594">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

The issue actually presented today is whether courts should apply the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine lest we create an incentive for the police to omit <em>Miranda</em> warnings, see <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), before custodial interrogation.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In closing their eyes to the consequences of giving an evidentiary advantage to those who ignore <em>Miranda</em>, the majority adds an important inducement for interrogators to ignore the rule in that case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miranda</em> rested on insight into the inherently coercive character of custodial interrogation and the inherently difficult exercise of assessing the voluntariness of any confession resulting from it.  Unless the police give the prescribed warnings meant to counter the coercive atmosphere, a custodial confession is inadmissible, there being no need for the previous time-consuming and difficult enquiry into voluntariness.  That inducement to forestall involuntary statements and troublesome issues of fact can only atrophy if we turn around and recognize an evidentiary benefit when an unwarned statement leads investigators to tangible evidence.  There is, of course, a price for excluding evidence, but the Fifth Amendment is worth a price, and in the absence of a very good reason, the logic of <em>Miranda</em> should be followed: a <em>Miranda</em> violation raises a presumption of coercion, <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, 306\xe2\x80\x93307, and n.\xc2\xa01 (1985), and the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination extends to the exclusion of derivative evidence, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hubbell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/27/index.html">530 U. S. 27</a>, 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (2000) (recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s use of incriminating information derived directly or indirectly from \xe2\x80\xa6 [actually] compelled testimony\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U. S. 441</a>, 453 (1972).  That should be the end of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the books contain some exceptions to the <em>Miranda</em> exclusionary rule carries no weight here.  In <em>Harris</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/222/index.html">401 U. S. 222</a> (1971), it was respect for the integrity of the judicial process that justified the admission of unwarned statements as impeachment evidence.  But Patane\xe2\x80\x99s suppression motion can hardly be described as seeking to \xe2\x80\x9cpervert\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miranda</em> \xe2\x80\x9cinto a license to use perjury\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise handicap the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional truth-testing devices of the adversary process.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 U. S., at 225\xe2\x80\x93226.  Nor is there any suggestion that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 failure to warn Patane was justified or mitigated by a public emergency or other exigent circumstance, as in <em>New York</em> v. <em>Quarles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a> (1984).  And of course the premise of <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, is not on point; although a failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings before one individual statement does not necessarily bar the admission of a subsequent statement given after adequate warnings, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

The incentive is an odd one, coming from the Court on the same day it decides <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Seibert</em>, <em>ante</em>.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In so saying, we are taking the legal issue as it comes to us, even though the facts give off the scent of a made-up case.  If there was a <em>Miranda</em> failure, the most immediate reason was that Patane told the police to stop giving the warnings because he already knew his rights.  There could easily be an analogy in this case to the bumbling mistake the police committed in <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

In <em>Tucker</em>, we explicitly declined to lay down a broad rule about the fruits of unwarned statements.  Instead, we \xe2\x80\x9cplace[d] our holding on a narrower ground,\xe2\x80\x9d relying principally on the fact that the interrogation occurred before <em>Miranda</em> was decided and was conducted in good faith according to constitutional standards governing at that time.  417 U.
