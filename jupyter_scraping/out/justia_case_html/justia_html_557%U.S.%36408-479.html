She admitted owning the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa and that the contraband was not hers.  He then produced four prescription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of which are banned under school rules without advance permission.  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report that she was giving pills to fellow students.  She denied it and agreed to let him search her belongings.  He and Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, searched Savana\xe2\x80\x99s backpack, finding nothing.  Wilson then had Romero take Savana to the school nurse\xe2\x80\x99s office to search her clothes for pills.  After Romero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.  No pills were found.  Savana\xe2\x80\x99s mother filed suit against petitioner school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging that the strip search violated Savana\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights.  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted the motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed.  Following the protocol for evaluating qualified immunity claims, see <em>Saucier </em>v.<em> Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set out in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L. O.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/index.html">469 U. S. 325</a>.  It then applied the test for qualified immunity.  Finding that Savana\xe2\x80\x99s right was clearly established at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judgment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because they were not independent decisionmakers.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The search of Savana\xe2\x80\x99s underwear violated the Fourth Amendment.

S., at 341.  Under the resulting reasonable suspicion standard, a school search \xe2\x80\x9cwill be permissible \xe2\x80\xa6 when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 342.  The required knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school administrator\xe2\x80\x99s evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savana\xe2\x80\x99s backpack and outer clothing.  A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills.  On the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came from Marissa.  Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wilson called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.  Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, <em>inter alia</em>, an over-the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savana\xe2\x80\x99s.  She also denied knowing about the day planner\xe2\x80\x99s contents.  Wilson did not ask her when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be hiding them.  After a search of Marissa\xe2\x80\x99s underwear by Romero and Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his office.  He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relationship with Marissa.  He knew that the girls had been identified as part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom.  He had other reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Savana\xe2\x80\x99s house where alcohol was served.  Thus, Marissa\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution.  A student who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her backpack.  Looking into Savana\xe2\x80\x99s bag, in her presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent search of her outer clothing.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indicate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed in her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant extending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her underwear.  Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything when Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its Fourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking and how much was seen.  Savana\xe2\x80\x99s actions in their presence necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.  Savana\xe2\x80\x99s subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating.  The reasonableness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the exposure\xe2\x80\x99s patent intrusiveness.  Its indignity does not outlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe search [be] \xe2\x80\x98reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 341.  Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion.  Because Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he must have known of their nature and limited threat and had no reason to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that individual students had great quantities.  Nor could he have suspected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.  When suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intrusiveness of a search down to an adolescent\xe2\x80\x99s body, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 general belief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a reasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will succeed.  Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such behavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that Savana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.  Wilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the pills on her person, much less in her underwear.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Although the strip search violated Savana\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from liability by qualified immunity because \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law [did] not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  The intrusiveness of the strip search here cannot, under<em> T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.,</em> be seen as justifiably related to the circumstances, but lower court cases viewing school strip searches differently are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting opinions, to counsel doubt about the clarity with which the right was previously stated.

Because there were no reasons to suspect the drugs presented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we hold that the search did violate the Constitution, but because there is reason to question the clarity with which the right was established, the official who ordered the unconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity from liability.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The events immediately prior to the search in question began in 13-year-old Savana Redding\xe2\x80\x99s math class at Safford Middle School one October day in 2003.  The assistant principal of the school, Kerry Wilson, came into the room and asked Savana to go to his office.  There, he showed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his desk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a permanent marker, and a cigarette.  Wilson asked Savana whether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a few days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa Glines.  Savana stated that none of the items in the planner belonged to her.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription-strength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter blue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflammation but banned under school rules without advance permission.  He asked Savana if she knew anything about the pills.  Savana answered that she did not.  Wilson then told Savana that he had received a report that she was giving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and agreed to let Wilson search her belongings.  Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, came into the office, and together with Wilson they searched Savana\xe2\x80\x99s backpack, finding nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana to the school nurse\xe2\x80\x99s office to search her clothes for pills.  Romero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to remove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch pants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was then asked to remove.  Finally, Savana was told to pull her bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.  No pills were found.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Savana\xe2\x80\x99s mother filed suit against Safford Unified School District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for conducting a strip search in violation of Savana\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights.  The individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of qualified immunity.  The District Court for the District of Arizona granted the motion on the ground that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  504 F.\xc2\xa03d 828 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, reversed.  Following the two-step protocol for evaluating claims of qualified immunity, see <em>Saucier </em>v.<em> Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 200 (2001),<em> </em>the Ninth Circuit held that the strip search was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set out in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/index.html"></a><a href="/us/469/325/index.html">469 U.

The Circuit then applied the test for qualified immunity, and found that Savana\xe2\x80\x99s right was clearly established at the time of the search: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]hese notions of personal privacy are \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d in that they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school teenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s proscription against unreasonable searches.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1088\xe2\x80\x931089 (quoting <em>Brannum </em>v. <em>Overton Cty. School Bd.</em>, 516 F.\xc2\xa03d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)).  The upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to Wilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Schwallier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative assistant, since they had not acted as independent decisionmakers.  531 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1089.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U.

S. 132</a>, 162 (1925)), and that evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the place to be searched.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, we recognized that the school setting \xe2\x80\x9crequires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search,\xe2\x80\x9d 469 U. S., at 340, and held that for searches by school officials \xe2\x80\x9ca careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 341.  We have thus applied a standard of reasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school administrator\xe2\x80\x99s search of a student, <em>id.</em>, at 342, 345, and have held that a school search \xe2\x80\x9cwill be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A number of our cases on probable cause have an implicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of reasonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the knowledge component by looking to the degree to which known facts imply prohibited conduct, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/index.html">407 U. S. 143</a>, 148 (1972); <em>id.</em>, at 160, n.\xc2\xa09 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information received, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Spinelli</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/410/index.html">393 U.

S. 108</a>, 114 (1964).  At the end of the day, however, we have realized that these factors cannot rigidly control, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/index.html">462 U. S. 213</a>, 230 (1983), and we have come back to saying that the standards are \xe2\x80\x9cfluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts\xe2\x80\x9d in which they are being assessed.  <em>Ornelas</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/690/index.html">517 U.

S., at 238, or a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial chance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 244, n.\xc2\xa013, of discovering evidence of criminal activity.  The lesser standard for school searches could as readily be described as a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the school\xe2\x80\x99s policies strictly prohibit the nonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds, including \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter drug, except those for which permission to use in school has been granted pursuant to Board policy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A week before Savana was searched, another student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the school\xe2\x80\x99s administrative assistant), told the principal and Assistant Principal Wilson that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain students were bringing drugs and weapons on campus,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had been sick after taking some pills that \xe2\x80\x9che got from a classmate.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 8a.  On the morning of October 8, the same boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa Glines had given him.  He told Wilson that students were planning to take the pills at lunch.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse, that the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by prescription.  Wilson then called Marissa out of class.  Outside the classroom, Marissa\xe2\x80\x99s teacher handed Wilson the day planner, found within Marissa\xe2\x80\x99s reach, containing various contraband items.  Wilson escorted Marissa back to his office.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested Marissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet.  Marissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade.  Wilson asked where the blue pill came from, and Marissa answered, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I guess it slipped in when <em>she</em> gave me the IBU 400s.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13a.  When Wilson asked whom she meant, Marissa replied, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Savana Redding.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its contents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them.  Wilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to determine whether there was any likelihood that Savana presently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received the pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill, but information provided through a poison control hotline[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] indicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an antiinflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available over the counter.  At Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s direction, Marissa was then subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Romero and Schwallier, as Savana was later on.  The search revealed no additional pills.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was at this juncture that Wilson called Savana into his office and showed her the day planner.  Their conversation established that Savana and Marissa were on friendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contraband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and that she had lent it to Marissa.  Wilson had other reports of their friendship from staff members, who had identified Savana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group at the school\xe2\x80\x99s opening dance in August, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom.  Wilson had reason to connect the girls with this contraband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the principal that before the dance, he had been at a party at Savana\xe2\x80\x99s house where alcohol was served.  Marissa\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the pills came from Savana was thus sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This suspicion of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s was enough to justify a search of Savana\xe2\x80\x99s backpack and outer clothing.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  If a student is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in the carryall that has become an item of student uniform in most places today.  If Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not understood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth making.  And the look into Savana\xe2\x80\x99s bag, in her presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent search of her outer clothing.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana\xe2\x80\x99s claim that extending the search at Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s behest to the point of making her pull out her underwear was constitutionally unreasonable.  The exact label for this final step in the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a fair way to speak of it.  Romero and Schwallier directed Savana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and then \xe2\x80\x9cpull out\xe2\x80\x9d her bra and the elastic band on her underpants.  <em>Id</em>., at 23a.  Although Romero and Schwallier stated that they did not see anything when Savana followed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we would not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment consequences in a way that would guarantee litigation about who was looking and how much was seen.  The very fact of Savana\xe2\x80\x99s pulling her underwear away from her body in the presence of the two officials who were able to see her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Savana\xe2\x80\x99s subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating.  The reasonableness of her expectation (required by the Fourth Amendment standard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.  See Brief for National Association of Social Workers et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x9314; Hyman &amp; Perone, The Other Side of School Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may Contribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J. School Psychology 7, 13 (1998) (strip search can \xe2\x80\x9cresult in serious emotional damage\xe2\x80\x9d).  The common reaction of these adolescents simply registers the obviously different meaning of a search exposing the body from the experience of nakedness or near undress in other school circumstances.  Changing for gym is getting ready for play; exposing for a search is responding to an accusation reserved for suspected wrongdoers and fairly understood as so degrading that a number of communities have decided that strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have\nbanned them no matter what the facts may\nbe, see, <em>e.g.</em>, New York City Dept. of Education, Reg. No. A\xe2\x80\x93432, p. 2 (2005), online at http://docs.nycenet.edu/\ndocushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21/A-432.pdf (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder no circumstances shall a strip-search of a student be\nconducted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indignity of the search does not, of course, outlaw it, but it does implicate the rule of reasonableness as stated in <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe search as actually conducted [be] reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>469 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The scope will be permissible, that is, when it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion.  Wilson knew beforehand that the pills were prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter naproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil, or one Aleve.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  He must have been aware of the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for, and while just about anything can be taken in quantities that will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual students were receiving great numbers of pills.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.  Petitioners suggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that \xe2\x80\x9cstudents \xe2\x80\xa6 hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of cases of students with contraband in their underwear, <em>id.</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness of a search down to the body of an adolescent requires some justification in suspected facts, general background possibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will pay off.  But nondangerous school contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of any general practice among Safford Middle School students of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was doing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that Wilson ordered yielded nothing.  Wilson never even determined when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the pills on her person, much less in her underwear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that pointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity, and any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills in her underwear.  We think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the assistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his motive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school and protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone through.  Parents are known to overreact to protect their children from danger, and a school official with responsibility for safety may tend to do the same.  The difference is that the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official, even with the high degree of deference that courts must pay to the educator\xe2\x80\x99s professional judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do mean, though, to make it clear that the <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em> concern to limit a school search to reasonable scope requires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing before a search can reasonably make the quantum leap from outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate parts.  The meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demanding its own specific suspicions.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A school official searching a student is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to qualified immunity where clearly established law does not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan</em>, 555 U.

S., at 342, and as we have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the strip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to the circumstances.  But we realize that the lower courts have reached divergent conclusions regarding how the <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em> standard applies to such searches.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A number of judges have read <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O. </em>as the en banc minority of the Ninth Circuit did here.  The Sixth Circuit upheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug, without any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her body.  <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ellington</em>, 936 F.\xc2\xa02d 881, 882\xe2\x80\x93883, 887 (1991).  And other courts considering qualified immunity for strip searches have read <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O. </em>as \xe2\x80\x9ca series of abstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming deference to the judgments of school officials, on the other,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Talladega City Bd. of Ed.</em>, 115 F.\xc2\xa03d 821, 828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible \xe2\x80\x9cto establish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment right \xe2\x80\xa6 [in] the wide variety of possible school settings different from those involved in <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d itself.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Roberts</em>, 323 F.\xc2\xa03d 950 (CA11 2003) (granting qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who conducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when looking for a missing $26).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case.  We would not suggest that entitlement to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of disuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state, courts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of judges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not automatically render the law unclear if we have been clear.  That said, however, the cases viewing school strip searches differently from the way we see them are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting opinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear in the prior statement of law.  We conclude that qualified immunity is warranted.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strip search of Savana Redding was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are nevertheless protected from liability through qualified immunity.  Our conclusions here do not resolve, however, the question of the liability of petitioner Safford Unified School District #1 under <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U. S. 658</a>, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not address.  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is remanded for consideration of the <em>Monell</em> claim.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school rule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy.

Except in patently arbitrary instances, Fourth Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it obviously should do in this case.  There is no need here either to explain the imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons for the school\xe2\x80\x99s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without advance permission.  Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to identify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforceable fast.  The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.   </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Poison control centers across the country maintain 24-hour help hotlines to provide \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate access to poison exposure management instructions and information on potential poisons.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Association of Poison Control Centers, online at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/\nAbout/tabid/74/Default.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 19, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0There is no question here that justification for the school officials\xe2\x80\x99 search was required in accordance with the <em>T.

S. 325</a> (1985), the Court established a two-step inquiry for determining the reasonableness of a school official\xe2\x80\x99s decision to search a student.  First, the Court explained, the search must be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified at its inception\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by the presence of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 342.  Second, the search must be \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible in its scope,\xe2\x80\x9d which is achieved \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and <em>not</em> <em>excessively intrusive</em> <em>in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

It simply applies <em>T.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>L.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>O.</em> to declare unconstitutional a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that was based on a groundless suspicion that she might be hiding medicine in her underwear.  This is, in essence, a case in which clearly established law meets clearly outrageous conduct.  I have long believed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 382, n. 25 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow</em>, 631 F.\xc2\xa02d 91, 92\xe2\x80\x9393 (CA7 1980)).  The strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both more intrusive and less justified than the search of the student\xe2\x80\x99s purse in <em>T. L. O.</em>  Therefore, while I join Parts I\xe2\x80\x93III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I disagree with its decision to extend qualified immunity to the school official who authorized this unconstitutional search.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified immunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals have adopted seemingly divergent views about <em>T.</em> <em>L.

It also grants judges sweeping authority to second-guess the measures that these officials take to maintain discipline in their schools and ensure the health and safety of the students in their charge.

School officials had found alcohol and cigarettes in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom during the first school dance of the year and noticed that a group of students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled of alcohol.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Several weeks later, another student, Jordan Romero, reported that Redding had hosted a party before the dance where she served whiskey, vodka, and tequila.  <em>Id.,</em> at 8a, 11a.  Romero had provided this report to school officials as a result of a meeting his mother scheduled with the officials after Romero \xe2\x80\x9cbec[a]me violent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csick to his stomach\xe2\x80\x9d one night and admitted that \xe2\x80\x9che had taken some pills that he had got[ten] from a classmate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 7a\xe2\x80\x938a, 10a\xe2\x80\x9311a.

Each of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable departure from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the school setting, where this Court has heretofore read the Fourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school officials.

A search of a student therefore is permissible in scope under <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em> so long as it is objectively reasonable to believe that the area searched could conceal the contraband.  The dissenting opinion below correctly captured this Fourth Amendment standard, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cif a student brought a baseball bat on campus in violation of school policy, a search of that student\xe2\x80\x99s shirt pocket would be patently unjustified.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1104 (opinion of Hawkins, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was permissible under that standard is straightforward.  Indeed, the majority does not dispute that \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral background possibilities\xe2\x80\x9d establish that students conceal \xe2\x80\x9ccontraband in their underwear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 10.  It acknowledges that school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in Redding\xe2\x80\x99s backpack and outer clothing because if \xe2\x80\x9cWilson\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not understood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth making.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  The majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any further with the search was unreasonable.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310; see also <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny reasonable search for the pills would have ended when inspection of Redding\xe2\x80\x99s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing\xe2\x80\x9d).  But there is no support for this conclusion.  The reasonable suspicion that Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes did not dissipate simply because the search of her backpack turned up nothing.  It was eminently reasonable to conclude that the backpack was empty because Redding was secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would look.  See <em>Ross</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 820 (\xe2\x80\x9cContraband goods rarely are strewn\xe2\x80\x9d about in plain view; \xe2\x80\x9cby their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Redding would not have been the first person to conceal pills in her undergarments.

According to the majority, the scope of the search was impermissible because the school official \xe2\x80\x9cmust have been aware of the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for\xe2\x80\x9d and because he \xe2\x80\x9chad no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual students were receiving great numbers of pills.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Thus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth Amendment violation in this case, the majority retreats from its observation that the school\xe2\x80\x99s firm no-drug policy \xe2\x80\x9cmakes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even accepting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that it is not attacking the rule\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness, it certainly is attacking the rule\xe2\x80\x99s importance.  This approach directly conflicts with <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em> in which the Court was \xe2\x80\x9cunwilling to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a judge\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the relative importance of school rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  469 U. S., at 342, n.\xc2\xa09.  Indeed, the Court in <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O. </em>expressly rejected the proposition that the majority seemingly endorses\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9csome rules regarding student conduct are by nature too \xe2\x80\x98trivial\xe2\x80\x99 to justify a search based upon reasonable suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.,</em> at 343, n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe promulgation of a rule forbidding specified conduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of school officials that such conduct is destructive of school order or of a proper educational environment.

The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).  The Fourth Amendment rule for searches is the same: Police officers are entitled to search regardless of the perceived triviality of the underlying law.  As we have explained, requiring police to make \xe2\x80\x9csensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Atwater</em> v. <em>Lago Vista</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/318/index.html">532 U.

Had the suspected infraction involved a street drug, the majority implies that it would have approved the scope of the search.  See<em> ante</em>, at 9 (relying on the \xe2\x80\x9climited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante,</em> at 10 (relying on the limited \xe2\x80\x9cpower of the drugs\xe2\x80\x9d involved).  In effect, then, the majority has replaced a school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a new one that does.  As a result, a full search of a student\xe2\x80\x99s person for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the Court agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently dangerous.  Such a test is unworkable and unsound.  School officials cannot be expected to halt searches based on the possibility that a court might later find that the particular infraction at issue is not severe enough to warrant an intrusive investigation.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rule promulgated by a school board represents the judgment of school officials that the rule is needed to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cschool order\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca proper educational environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, 469 U.

Reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interference in these matters of great concern to teachers, parents, and students illustrates why the most constitutionally sound approach to the question of applying the Fourth Amendment in local public schools would in fact be the complete restoration of the common-law doctrine of <em>in loco parentis</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the early years of public schooling,\xe2\x80\x9d courts applied the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis</em> to transfer to teachers the authority of a parent to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morse</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 413\xe2\x80\x93414 (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pendergrass</em>, 19 N.\xc2\xa0C. 365, 365\xe2\x80\x93366 (1837)).  So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators had almost complete discretion to establish and enforce the rules they believed were necessary to maintain control over their classrooms.  See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 205 (1873) (\xe2\x80\x9cSo the power allowed by law to the parent over the person of the child may be delegated to a tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the purpose of education\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 W.

There can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search at issue in this case.  Parents have \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to searches of a child or that child\xe2\x80\x99s belongings.  <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, 469 U.

In light of this relationship, the Court has indicated that a parent can authorize a third-party search of a child by consenting to such a search, even if the child denies his consent.  See <em>ibid.;</em> see also 4 W.

Indeed, parents and local government officials have proved themselves quite capable of challenging overly harsh school rules or the enforcement of sensible rules in insensible ways.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, one community questioned a school policy that resulted in \xe2\x80\x9can 11-year-old [being] arrested, handcuffed, and taken to jail for bringing a plastic butter knife to school.\xe2\x80\x9d  Downey, Zero Tolerance Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Always Add Up, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 6, 2009, p.\xc2\xa0A11.

Parents, teachers, school administrators, local politicians, and state officials are all better suited than judges to determine the appropriate limits on searches conducted by school officials.  Preservation of order, discipline, and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution.

And yet the Court has limited the authority of school officials to conduct searches for the drugs that the officials believe pose a serious safety risk to their students.  By doing so, the majority has confirmed that a return to the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis</em> is required to keep the judiciary from essentially seizing control of public schools.  Only then will teachers again be able to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98govern the[ir] pupils, quicken the slothful, spur the indolent, restrain the impetuous, and control the stubborn\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by making \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rules, giv[ing] commands, and punish[ing] disobedience\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d without interference from judges.  See <em>Morse</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414.  By deciding that it is better equipped to decide what behavior should be permitted in schools, the Court has undercut student safety and undermined the authority of school administrators and local officials.  Even more troubling, it has done so in a case in which the underlying response by school administrators was reasonable and justified.  I cannot join this regrettable decision.  I, therefore, respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that this search violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be sure, Redding denied knowledge of the pills and the materials in her planner.

But the school was under no constitutional obligation to call Redding\xe2\x80\x99s parents before conducting the search: \xe2\x80\x9c[R]easonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least intrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist.

But I also agree with Justice Stevens, <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, that our opinion in <em>New Jersey</em> v. <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/index.html">469 U. S. 325</a> (1985), \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d the law governing this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her pocket, accused Redding of supplying them.  App. 13a.  Asked where the blue pill among several white pills in Glines\xe2\x80\x99s pocket came from, Glines answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI guess it slipped in when <em>she</em> gave me the IBU 400s.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Asked next \xe2\x80\x9cwho is <em>she</em>?\xe2\x80\x9d, Glines responded: \xe2\x80\x9cSavana Redding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As the Court observes, <em>ante</em>, at 6, 10, no followup questions were asked.  Wilson did not test Glines\xe2\x80\x99s accusation for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give her the pills, where, for what purpose.  Any reasonable search for the pills would have ended when inspection of Redding\xe2\x80\x99s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing.  Wilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience at the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hidden pills\xe2\x80\x94containing the equivalent of two Advils or one Aleve\xe2\x80\x94in her underwear or body.  To make matters worse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class or to go home, after the search.  Instead, he made her sit on a chair outside his office for over two hours.  At no point did he attempt to call her parent.  Abuse of authority of that order should not be shielded by official immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to<em> T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, where a teacher discovered a student smoking in the lavatory, and where the search was confined to the student\xe2\x80\x99s purse, the search of Redding involved her body and rested on the bare accusation of another student whose reliability the Assistant Principal had no reason to trust.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O. </em>plainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A search ordered by a school official, even if \xe2\x80\x9cjustified at its inception,\xe2\x80\x9d crosses the constitutional boundary if it becomes \xe2\x80\x9cexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\xe2\x80\x9d  469 U. S., at 342 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the [supposed] infraction,\xe2\x80\x9d the slim basis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her \xe2\x80\x9cage and sex,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s order cannot be reconciled with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.  </em>Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Redding was abusive and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it.  I join Justice Stevens in dissenting from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s qualified immunity plea, and would affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment in all respects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
