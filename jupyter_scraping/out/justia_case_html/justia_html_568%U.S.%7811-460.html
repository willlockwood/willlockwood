Because storm water is often heavily polluted, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and its implementing regulations require certain MS4 operators to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit before discharging storm water into navigable waters.  The District has such a permit for its MS4.  Respondents Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and Santa Monica Baykeeper (Baykeeper) filed a citizen suit against the District and others under \xc2\xa7505 of the CWA, \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365, alleging, among other things, that water-quality measurements from monitoring stations within the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers demonstrated that the District was violating the terms of its permit.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the District on these claims, concluding that the record was insufficient to warrant a finding that the MS4 had discharged storm water containing the standards-exceeding pollutants detected at the downstream monitoring stations.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.  The court held that the District was liable for the discharge of pollutants that, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, occurred when the polluted water detected at the monitoring stations flowed out of the concrete-lined portions of the rivers, where the monitoring stations are located, into lower, unlined portions of the same rivers.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d under the CWA.

In this Court, the parties and the United States as amicus curiae agree that the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  They base this accord on South Fla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 95\n\xe2\x80\x93112 (2004), in which we accepted that pumping polluted water from one part of a water body into another part of the same body is not a discharge of pol- lutants under the CWA.  Adhering to the view we took in Miccosukee, we hold that the parties correctly answered the sole question presented in the negative.  The decision in this suit rendered by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is inconsistent with our determination.  We therefore reverse that court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Los Angeles County Flood Control District (District) operates a \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipal separate storm sewer system\xe2\x80\x9d (MS4)\xe2\x80\x94a drainage system that collects, transports, and discharges storm water.

Because storm water is often heavily polluted, see 64 Fed. Reg. 68724\xe2\x80\x9368727 (1999), the CWA and its implementing regulations require the operator of an MS4 serving a population of at least 100,000 to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit before discharging storm water into navigable waters.  See 33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1342(p)(2)(C), and (D); 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7122.26(a)(3), (b)(4), (b)(7).

It was undisputed, the District Court acknowledged, that \xe2\x80\x9cdata from the Los Angeles River and San Gabriel River [monitoring] stations indicate[d] that water quality standards ha[d] repeatedly been exceeded for a number of pollutants, including aluminum, copper, cyanide, fecal coliform bacteria, and zinc.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 108.  But numerous entities other than the District, the court added, discharge into the rivers upstream of the monitoring stations.  See id., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  See also 673 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889 (observing that the pollutants of \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of permitted dischargers\xe2\x80\x9d reach the rivers).  The record was insufficient, the District Court concluded, to warrant a finding that the District\xe2\x80\x99s MS4 had discharged storm water containing the standards-exceeding pollutants detected at the downstream monitoring stations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.  The monitoring stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, the Court of Appeals said, are located in \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete channels\xe2\x80\x9d constructed for flood-control purposes.  Id., at 900.  See also id., at 889 (describing the monitoring stations\xe2\x80\x99 location).  Based on this impression, the Court of Appeals held that a discharge of pollutants occurred under the CWA when the polluted water detected at the monitoring stations \xe2\x80\x9cflowed out of the concrete channels\xe2\x80\x9d and entered downstream portions of the waterways lacking concrete linings.  Id., at 900.  Because the District exer- cises control over the concrete-lined portions of the rivers, the Court of Appeals held, the District is liable for the discharges that, in the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s view, occur when water exits those concrete channels.  See id., at 899\xe2\x80\x93901.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari on the following question: Under the CWA, does a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d occur when polluted water \xe2\x80\x9cflows from one portion of a river that is navigable water of the United States, through a concrete channel or other engineered improvement in the river,\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cinto a lower portion of the same river\xe2\x80\x9d?  Pet. for Cert. i.  See 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).  As noted above, see supra, at 1, the parties, as well as the United States as amicus curiae, agree that the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat agreement is hardly surprising, for we held in Miccosukee that the transfer of polluted water between \xe2\x80\x9ctwo parts of the same water body\xe2\x80\x9d does not constitute a discharge of pollutants under the CWA.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109\xe2\x80\x93112.  We derived that determination from the CWA\xe2\x80\x99s text, which defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(12) (emphasis added).  Under a common understanding of the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cadd,\xe2\x80\x9d no pollutants are \xe2\x80\x9cadded\xe2\x80\x9d to a water body when water is merely transferred between different portions of that water body.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 24 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cadd\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cto join, annex, or unite (as one thing to another) so as to bring about an increase (as in number, size, or importance) or so as to form one aggregate\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cAs the Second Circuit [aptly] put it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , \xe2\x80\x98[i]f one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above the pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not \xe2\x80\x9cadded\xe2\x80\x9d soup or anything else to the pot.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Miccosukee, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109\xe2\x80\x93110 (quoting Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. New York, 273 F.\xc2\xa03d 481, 492 (CA2 2001)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Miccosukee, polluted water was removed from a ca- nal, transported through a pump station, and then de- posited into a nearby reservoir.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 100.  We held that this water transfer would count as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA only if the canal and the reservoir were \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfully distinct water bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 112.  It follows, a\xc2\xa0fortiori, from Miccosukee that no discharge of pollutants occurs when water, rather than being removed and then returned to a water body, simply flows from one portion of the water body to another.  We hold, therefore, that the flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA.  Because the decision below cannot be squared with that holding, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment must be reversed.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe NRDC and Baykeeper urge that the Court of Appeals reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reason.
