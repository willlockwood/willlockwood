It is a companion case to No. 498, <em>North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/43/case.html">402 U. S. 43</a></span>.  We postponed decision on the question of jurisdiction, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/803/case.html">400 U. S. 803</a></span> (1970), and, after hearing on the merits, we now dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>At the hearing, both parties argued to the three-judge court that the anti-busing law was constitutional and urged that the order of the District Court adopting the Finger plan should be set aside.  We are thus confronted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 402 U. S. 48</a></p><p> with the anomaly that both litigants desire precisely the same result, namely a holding that the anti-busing statute is constitutional.  There is, therefore, no case or controversy within the meaning of Art. III of the Constitution.  <em>Muskrat v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/219/346/case.html">219 U. S. 346</a></span> (1911).  Additionally, since neither party sought an injunction to restrain a state officer from enforcing a state statute alleged to be unconstitutional, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281, this is not an appeal from "any civil action, suit or proceeding required . . . to be heard . . . by a district court of three judges," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253, and hence no direct appeal to this Court is available.</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
