S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73729(a).  That prohibition may be enforced in suits filed by the Attorney General, \xc2\xa73730(a), and in <em>qui tam</em> actions brought by private individuals in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s name, \xc2\xa73730(b)(1).  A 1986 amendment to the FCA created a private cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding, \xc2\xa73730(h), and revised the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, \xc2\xa73731(b).  Section 3731(b) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought \xe2\x80\xa6 more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 2001, respondent Wilson brought an FCA <em>qui tam </em>action against petitioners, along with an FCA retaliation claim.  Petitioner Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District employed Wilson as a secretary.  Wilson alleged that petitioner county officials retaliated against her for alerting federal officials to the purported fraud and for cooperating with the ensuing investigation, ultimately forcing her 1997 resignation from the District.  Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss the retaliation claim as untimely, on the ground that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year statute of limitations governed Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s FCA action and barred it.  Reversing, the Fourth Circuit found it unnecessary to borrow a state limitations period because one was supplied by \xc2\xa73731(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 3731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period does not govern \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions.  Instead, the most closely analogous state statute of limitations applies.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by federal statute, this Court asks first whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period.  If not, the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 3730(h) is a subsection of \xc2\xa73730, but \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) is nonetheless ambiguous about whether a \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation action is \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d as that phrase is used in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1).  Another reasonable reading is that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period applies only to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions.  Section 3731(b)(1) starts the limitations period running on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, on the date the false claim was actually submitted.  That language casts doubt on whether \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions.  For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) is applicable.  By contrast, the section naturally applies to well-pleaded \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73370(a) and (b) actions.  Those actions require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim and therefore necessarily specify when \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s time limit begins.  At a minimum this anomaly shows that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d means all actions arising under that section.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Two considerations show that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73370(a) and (b) actions.  First, the very next subsection, \xc2\xa73730(c), uses the similarly unqualified phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73370(a) and (b) actions.  Second, reading \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to apply only to those actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.  Where, as here, there are two plausible constructions, this Court should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.  This approach resolves \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguity in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  Reading \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues, for the likely analogous state statutes virtually all start when the retaliatory action occurs.  However, under the reading favored by Wilson and the Government, the limitations period would begin at best on the date an actual or suspected FCA violation occurred, which would precede the retaliatory conduct.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance the appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73731(b)(1), governs FCA civil actions for retaliation, see \xc2\xa73730(h).  We hold that it does not and therefore conclude that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCA prohibits any person from making false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States.  \xc2\xa73729(a).  Persons who do so are liable for civil penalties of up to $10,000 per claim and treble damages.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Act sets forth two principal enforcement mechanisms for policing this proscription.  First, the Attorney General may sue to remedy violations of \xc2\xa73729.  \xc2\xa73730(a).  Second, private individuals may bring <em>qui tam </em>actions in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s name for \xc2\xa73729 violations.  \xc2\xa73730(b)(1); see <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/765/index.html">529 U. S. 765</a>, 769\xe2\x80\x93772 (2000).  The <em>qui tam </em>relator must give the Government notice of the action, and the Government is entitled to intervene in the suit.  \xc2\xa73730(b)(2).  The relator receives up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, in addition to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.   \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1986 amendments to the FCA created a third enforcement mechanism: a private cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding.  \xc2\xa73730(h).  Section 3730(h) provides in relevant part that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nRemedies for retaliation include reinstatement, two times the amount of backpay plus interest, special damages, litigation costs, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1986 amendments also revised the language of the 6-year statute of limitations applicable to FCA actions.  The previous version of the statute provided  that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730 of this title must be brought within 6 years from the date the violation is committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73731(b) (1982 ed.).  The 1986 amendments revised this provision to read:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be brought\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73731.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2001, respondent Karen T. Wilson brought an FCA <em>qui tam </em>and retaliation action against petitioners.  Petitioners Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation District are special-purpose local government entities; the other petitioners are various local and federal officials.  Graham County District employed Wilson as a secretary.  Wilson alleged that petitioners made numerous false claims for payment to the United States in connection with a federal disaster relief program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, App. 17\xe2\x80\x9320, and in connection with agricultural programs administered by North Carolina but funded by the Federal Government,  <em>id., </em>at 17\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wilson contended, in addition, that Graham County District officials retaliated against her for aiding federal officials in their investigation of these false claims.  <em>Id., </em>at 25\xe2\x80\x9330.  Wilson alerted federal officials to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suspected fraudulent activities in December 1995 and cooperated with the ensuing investigation.  <em>Id., </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Because of her cooperation, the complaint alleged, Graham County District officials repeatedly harassed her from 1996 to 1997, eventually inducing her to resign in March 1997.  <em>Id., </em>at 28\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation action as untimely.  They argued that the 6-year limitations period provided in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) did not apply to Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation action.  Absent an applicable federal limitations period, they asked the District Court to borrow North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year statute of limitations for retaliatory-discharge actions.  The District Court agreed and dismissed the retaliation claim, since Wilson filed it more than three years after her March 1997 discharge.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a\xe2\x80\x9370a.  The court certified that ruling for interlocutory appeal.  224 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1042, 1050\xe2\x80\x931051 (WDNC 2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the plain language of \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) supplies a limitations period for retaliation actions, making it unnecessary to borrow one from North Carolina law.  The court reasoned that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) governs \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions, because it applies its 6-year limitations period to \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730.\xe2\x80\x9d  367 F.\xc2\xa03d 245, 251 (2004) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals regarding whether \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year statute of limitations applies to \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions or whether, instead, the most closely analogous state limitations period governs.  543 U. S. ___ (2005).  Compare <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Honeywell Inc.</em>, 33 F.\xc2\xa03d 860, 865\xe2\x80\x93866 (CA7 1994) (holding that FCA 6-year period applies), with <em>United States ex rel. Lujan </em>v. <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027, 1034\xe2\x80\x931035 (CA9 1998) (holding that most closely analogous state limitations period governs).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by a federal statute, we first ask whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period.  If it does not, we generally \xe2\x80\x9cborrow\xe2\x80\x9d the most closely analogous state limitations period.  See <em>North Star Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Thomas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/29/index.html">515 U. S. 29</a>, 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (1995); <em>Reed</em> v. <em>Transportation Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/319/index.html">488 U. S. 319</a>, 324 (1989); <em>Agency Holding Corp.</em> v. <em>Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/index.html">483 U. S. 143</a>, 157\xe2\x80\x93165 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (tracing history of borrowing state limitations periods).  In the rare case, we have even borrowed analogous federal<em> </em>limitations periods in the absence of an expressly applicable one, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id., </em>at 150\xe2\x80\x93157, but no party points to a reason why we should do so here, and we can think of none.  The only arguably applicable express statute of limitations is the 6-year limit set forth in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1).  The question, then, is whether \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) applies by its terms to retaliation actions under \xc2\xa73730(h); if it does not, our cases dictate that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa73731(b)(1), \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought \xe2\x80\xa6 more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Following the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 lead and supported by the United States appearing as <em>amicus curiae</em>, Wilson argues that this language unambiguously applies to FCA retaliation actions.  She points out that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) applies a 6-year limitations period to \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action under section 3730,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xc2\xa73730(h) actions arise under \xc2\xa73730; hence, they claim, the 6-year period governs \xc2\xa73730(h) actions.  See <em>Neal</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 865\xe2\x80\x93866 (arguing same).  We think the statute is more complex than this argument supposes.  Statutory language has meaning only in context, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 7), and \xc2\xa73731(b)(1), read in its proper context, does not govern \xc2\xa73730(h) actions for retaliation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous, rather than clear, about whether a \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation action is \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action under section 3730.\xe2\x80\x9d  Another reasonable reading is that it applies only to actions arising under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b), not to \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions.  That reading is suggested by the language in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) tying the start of the time limit to \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, the time limit begins to run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim for payment.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1.  This language casts doubt on whether \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions.  For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) is applicable.  A retaliation plaintiff, instead, need prove only that the defendant retaliated against him for engaging in \xe2\x80\x9clawful acts done \xe2\x80\xa6 in furtherance<em> </em>of\xe2\x80\x9d an FCA \xe2\x80\x9caction filed or to be filed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(h), language that protects an employee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct even if the target of an investigation or action to be filed was innocent.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Applying \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to FCA retaliation actions, then, sits uneasily with \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language, which assumes that well-pleaded \xe2\x80\x9caction[s] under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d to which it is applicable include a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of section 3729\xe2\x80\x9d certain from which to start the time running.  Section 3731(b)(1), by contrast, naturally applies to well-pleaded \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions.  They require the plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore necessarily specify when \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s time limit begins.  This textual anomaly, at a minimum, shows that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d means all actions under \xc2\xa73730, or only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute contains this anomaly, and instead urge that it clearly applies by its terms to all \xc2\xa73730 actions.  They point out that every \xc2\xa73730(h) action requires the plaintiff to prove that he engaged in protected conduct related to at least a <em>suspected </em>violation of \xc2\xa73729, and argue that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period simply begins to run on the date of the suspected violation.  Assuming, without deciding, that \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions have as an element a suspected violation of \xc2\xa73729, their interpretation indeed removes the anomaly, but only at the cost of reading into the statute the word \xe2\x80\x9csuspected\xe2\x80\x9d before the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of section 3729.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 3731(b)(1) speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cviolation[s] of section 3729\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>actual</em>, not <em>suspected</em>, ones.  Wilson and the United States answer that this argument proves too much, because even \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions involve only \xe2\x80\x9csuspected\xe2\x80\x9d violations of \xc2\xa73729 at the pleading stage of litigation; but this response misses the point.  Every \xc2\xa73730(a) or (b) plaintiff who states or proves a valid claim for relief must allege or prove an actual<em> </em>violation of \xc2\xa73729; retaliation plaintiffs need only allege or prove a suspected<em> </em>violation of \xc2\xa73729 (or so we are willing to assume).  The point is that \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language applies naturally to all successfully pleaded or proved retaliation actions only if one reads \xe2\x80\x9csuspected\xe2\x80\x9d into its terms, as the dissent essentially concedes.  See <em>post</em>, at 4 (opinion of Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s literal text, then, is ambiguous.  Wilson and the Government ask us to read it as if it said \xe2\x80\x9cthe [suspected or actual] violation of section 3729.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners ask us to read \xc2\xa73731(b) as if it said \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two considerations convince us that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions, and not \xc2\xa73730(h) retaliation actions.  First, the very next subsection of the statute, \xc2\xa73731(c), also uses the similarly unqualified phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions.  Section 3731(c) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Wilson and the United States concede, the context of this provision implies that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany action brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d is limited to \xc2\xa73730(a) actions brought by the United States and \xc2\xa73730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes as a party, as those are the types of \xc2\xa73730 actions in which the United States necessarily participates.  Otherwise, the United States would be \xe2\x80\x9crequired to prove all essential elements of the cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73731(c), in all \xc2\xa73730 actions, regardless of whether it participated in the action (a consequence the dissent implicitly embraces by claiming that \xe2\x80\x9cany action brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73731(c) means all \xc2\xa73730 actions, see <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Breyer, J.)).  This implicit limitation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d shows that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d imprecisely in \xc2\xa73731 and, in particular, that Congress sometimes used the term to refer only to a subset of \xc2\xa73730 actions.  It is reasonable to read the same language in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to be likewise limited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, reading \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to apply only to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues.  We have repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates against the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</em> v. <em>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/192/index.html">522 U. S. 192</a>, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 9) (calling it \xe2\x80\x9chighly doubtful\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended a time limit on pursuing a claim to expire before the claim arose); <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Cooper,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/258/index.html">507 U. S. 258</a>, 267 (1993) (declining to countenance the \xe2\x80\x9codd result\xe2\x80\x9d that a federal cause of action and statute of limitations arise at different times \xe2\x80\x9cabsen[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 any such indication in the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 37 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cAbsent other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff has the right to apply to the court for relief\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Therefore, where, as the case is here, there are two plausible constructions of a statute of limitations, we should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation)\naccrues.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach resolves the ambiguity in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  On the one hand, reading \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues.  If \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) excludes retaliation actions, then no express time limit applies to \xc2\xa73730(h) actions, and we borrow the most closely analogous state time limit absent an expressly applicable one.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The likely analogous state statutes of limitations virtually all start to run when the cause of action accrues\xe2\x80\x94in retaliation actions, when the retaliatory action occurs.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretation favored by Wilson and the Government, on the other hand, is in tension with this rule of construction.  Under their reading, the statute of limitations for FCA retaliation actions begins to run, at best, on the date the actual or suspected FCA violation occurred.  Because that date will precede the retaliatory conduct, their reading starts the time limit running before the retaliation action accrues.  Even more oddly, their reading allows a retaliation action to be time barred before it ever accrues\xe2\x80\x94for example, if the employer discovers more than six years after the suspected violation of \xc2\xa73729 that an employee aided in investigating that fraud, then retaliates.  As we have discussed, \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text permits a construction that avoids these counterintuitive results\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d means only those civil actions under \xc2\xa73730 that have as an element a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of section 3729,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granted, other textual evidence cuts against this reading of \xc2\xa73731(b)(1).  In particular, Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbrought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73731(d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could have been similarly precise in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) if it wished.  In the context of this statute, however, that argument proves too much, since the same could be said of \xc2\xa73731(c), which all agree uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d in more limited, and less precise, fashion.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8.  We do not doubt that Congress could have drafted \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) with more precision than it did, but the presence of the same inexact wording in \xc2\xa73731(c) means that the more precise language in \xc2\xa73731(d) casts little doubt on our reading of the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons we have discussed, the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s express limitations period does not apply to \xc2\xa73730(h) actions.  The most closely analogous state statute of limitations therefore applies.  Judge Wilkinson, in his dissenting opinion below, concluded that the most closely analogous state statute of limitations in this case is North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year statute of limitations governing wrongful-discharge claims.  See 367 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 261\xe2\x80\x93262.  The appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow, however, is not within the scope of the question we granted certiorari to decide, and the Court of Appeals did not pass on the point.  We therefore leave that issue for remand.  The judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"></footnote></casctfnt></em><p align="left"><em>*\xc2\xa0Justice Souter</em> joins all but footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>United States ex rel.

It says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action <em>under section 3730 </em>may not be brought \xe2\x80\xa6 more than 6 years after the date on which the violation\xe2\x80\x9d of federal false claims law \xe2\x80\x9cis committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)

Thus, a retaliation action is a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action under section 3730,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year limitations period applies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court tries to overcome the force of this syllogism with the help of two textual arguments.  First, it points to the subsection that follows \xc2\xa73731(b)\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa73731(c)\xe2\x80\x94which says that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n any action brought under section 3730,<em> </em>the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 8.  The Court then reasons that, read in context, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d could not refer to <em>all </em>the civil actions listed under \xc2\xa73730, for the United States is not ordinarily a party to private retaliation suits brought under \xc2\xa73730(h).  <em>Ibid.</em>  Rather, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d must refer only to the false claims actions listed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b).  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, according to the Court, if in \xc2\xa73731(c), the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to a <em>subset</em> of the actions listed under \xc2\xa73730, one can read the similar phrase in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) to contain a similar limitation.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.  The reason that \xc2\xa73731(c) may apply only to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(a) and (b) actions has nothing to do with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction brought under section 3730.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, any limitation on \xc2\xa73731(c)\xe2\x80\x99s application comes from different words, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  These latter words make clear not that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d has a different <em>meaning</em> than in (b), but that (c) comes into play only in cases in which the United States is a party (and <em>only</em> in such cases, compare <em>ibid.</em>).  Because it is these words\xe2\x80\x94the subject of the subsection, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that determines whether (c) has application in any given case, there is nothing in \xc2\xa73731(c) that would make it \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> to read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caction under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d <em>in</em> <em>section 3731(b)(1) </em>to apply, as the Court concludes, to only \xe2\x80\x9ctwo out of three actions under section 3730.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The subsections surrounding \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73731(b) and (c) further undermine the Court\xe2\x80\x99s extratextual limitation on \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730.\xe2\x80\x9d  In \xc2\xa73731(a), Congress apparently used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d to mean all three \xc2\xa73730 actions.  \xc2\xa73731(a) (a \xe2\x80\x9csubpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a trial or hearing conducted under section 3730 of this title may be served at any place in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  And in \xc2\xa73731(d), Congress used the very words that the Court seeks to find in \xc2\xa73731(b), but that do not there exist\xe2\x80\x94namely, the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when it meant to narrow a provision\xe2\x80\x99s compass to two out of the three \xc2\xa73730 causes of action.  \xc2\xa73731(d) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] final judgment rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements \xe2\x80\xa6 shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ante</em>, at 12.  The statutory context therefore shows that Congress did not intend for the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730\xe2\x80\x9d to mean anything other than what it says.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court points to language in \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) that specifies <em>when</em> the limitations period begins to run: \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the violation\xe2\x80\x9d of the false claims provision, \xc2\xa73729, \xe2\x80\x9cis<em> </em>committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  It then points out that a retaliation action does not necessarily involve an <em>actual</em> false claims violation, because (it assumes) a retaliation plaintiff need only show \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>suspected </em>violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (emphasis in original).  Thus, adopting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the Court reasons, would require reading some words into \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94so that it would say \xe2\x80\x9cthe [suspected or actual] violation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which would distort the statute more than reading some other, different words into the statute\xe2\x80\x94so that it would say \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulty with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s choice of the latter linguistic addition is that the two sets of textual insertions\xe2\x80\x94on the one hand \xe2\x80\x9csuspected or actual,\xe2\x80\x9d on the other hand \xe2\x80\x9c(a) or (b)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not equivalent.  Statutes of limitations, when referring to starting points, generally refer not to <em>actual </em>events, but to <em>alleged </em>events.  Thus, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tort action is timely if he files it within, say, three years of the <em>alleged </em>negligently caused injury; a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s breach-of-contract action is timely if filed within, say, one year of the <em>alleged </em>breach.  And a plaintiff who loses such an action because the defendant shows, say, that there was no such injury or no such breach, has not, for that reason, brought the action outside the limitations period.  Rather, the suit is still timely even though the violation remains nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9calleged\xe2\x80\x9d after trial.  Such a plaintiff has simply lost a timely filed<em> </em>action on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision before us is no different.  Section 3731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-year time clock begins to run on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the violation\xe2\x80\x9d of federal false claims law, \xc2\xa73729, \xe2\x80\x9cis committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, any \xc2\xa73730 plaintiff\xe2\x80\x94even one bringing a false claims action under \xc2\xa73730(a) or \xc2\xa73730(b)\xe2\x80\x94has six years from the moment of a suspected\xe2\x80\x94that is, an unproven\xe2\x80\x94violation of the False Claims Act\xe2\x80\x99s antifraud provision.  Thus, as naturally interpreted, the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the violation . . . is committed\xe2\x80\x9d refer to the date on which the suspected violation occurs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that there is a relevant distinction in this case.  In the typical case (say, the tort or contract case) the plaintiff must ultimately prove all the relevant allegations.  Here, the retaliation victim need not prove that her employer did in fact violate federal false claims law, but only that she believed that there was such a violation.  See <em>ibid.</em>  But that distinction does not make the difference.  Given the clear link between claimed violations of federal false claims law and retaliation actions (the latter depend on the former) and given that triggering events in statutes of limitations implicitly mean <em>alleged</em> triggering events, \xc2\xa73731(b)(1) remains most naturally read as implicitly referring to alleged or suspected violations of federal false claims law.  And at the very least, reading the statute in this way, especially in light of the other statutory indicators, see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x933, does far less violence to \xc2\xa73731(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text than does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s addition of \xe2\x80\x9c(a) or (b).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s far stronger argument is not textual.  It concerns the limitations provision\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  That purpose, after all, includes providing victims of retaliation a reasonable time within which they can file an action to vindicate their rights.  Cf. S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93345, p.\xc2\xa034 (1986) (addition of a retaliation cause of action intended \xe2\x80\x9cto halt companies \xe2\x80\xa6 from using the threat of economic retaliation to silence \xe2\x80\x98whistleblowers\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cassure those who may be considering exposing fraud that they are legally protected from retaliatory acts\xe2\x80\x9d).  How can we reconcile that purpose with a reading of the statute that, as a matter of logic, could allow the limitations period to begin to run, perhaps even to terminate, before the forbidden retaliation occurs?  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer, in my view, is that Congress could have had a particular <em>qui tam</em>-related purpose in mind.  That is, it could have intended to provide a fairly lengthy limitations period, namely six years from the time the false claims conduct occurs, applicable to <em>all </em>related actions, and then to put an end to all such litigation.  This makes particular sense given the reasonable assumption that false claims and retaliation actions are likely to be litigated together.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 11\xe2\x80\x9335 (respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint pursuing both <em>qui tam</em> and retaliation claims in same suit); <em>United States ex rel.</em> <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027, 1030 (CA9 1998) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, as the Court emphasizes, such an unusual provision exacts a price, namely possible injury to an individual who suffers retaliation that comes late in the day.  But apparently there is no such individual<em>.  </em>Neither the Court nor petitioners have been able to find any actual example.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 6; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>27\xe2\x80\x9328 (United States is unaware of any such example).  Nor have I.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute exacts a different, but certain, price.  It substitutes for a fairly lengthy\xe2\x80\x94and <em>uniform</em>\xe2\x80\x946-year limitations term, a crazy-quilt of limitations periods stitched together from the laws of 51 jurisdictions which, in some instances, might require a plaintiff to bring a retaliation claim within 90 days, six months, or one year after the retaliation takes place.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa761.103(2) (Lexis 2004) (90-day limitations period for certain whistle-blower actions); Fla. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7112.3187(8)(a) (West Supp. 2005) (180-day limitations period); <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1035 (California\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period for wrongful termination in violation of public policy applies to \xc2\xa73730(h) action).  Rather than shed crocodile tears for the imagined plight of a nonexistent whistle-blower as petitioners ask us to do, I would read the statute to do what the statute says Congress wanted: to provide a relatively long, single, uniform limitations period that, in practice, seems to protect the many real potential plaintiffs, such as respondent, who will otherwise find themselves shut out of court.  Such a reading also avoids the attendant practical difficulties and uncertainties inherent in requiring federal courts to borrow state statutes of limitations.  See <em>Jones</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/369/index.html">541 U.
