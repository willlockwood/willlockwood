Portions of the Recovery Act mirror Chapters 9 and 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and enable Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s public utility corporations to restructure their climbing debt.  Respondents, a group of investment funds and utility bondholders, sought to enjoin the Act.  They contended, among other things, that a Bankruptcy Code provision explicitly pre-empts the Recovery Act, see\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7903(1).  The District Court enjoined the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement, and the First Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to include Puerto Rico, except for purposes of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9, \xc2\xa7101(52), did not remove Puerto Rico from the scope of the pre-emption provision. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: \xc2\xa0Section 903(1) of the Bankruptcy Code pre-empts Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Recovery Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Three federal municipal bankruptcy provisions are relevant here.  First, the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d provision, \xc2\xa7109(c), requires a Chapter 9 debtor to be an insolvent municipality that is \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authorized\xe2\x80\x9d by a State \xe2\x80\x9cto be a debtor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, the pre-emption provision, \xc2\xa7903(1), expressly bars States from enacting municipal bankruptcy laws.  Third, the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(52), as amended in 1984, \xe2\x80\x9cincludes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0If petitioners are correct that the amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d excludes Puerto Rico altogether from Chapter 9, then the pre-emption provision does not apply.  But if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 narrower reading is correct and the definition only precludes Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief, then Puerto Rico is barred from implementing its Recovery Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s plain text supports respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading.  The unambiguous language of the pre-emption provision \xe2\x80\x9ccontains an express pre-emption clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the plain wording of which \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emptive intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chamber of Commerce of United States of America</i> v. <i>Whiting</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 582\n.  The definition provision excludes Puerto Rico for the single purpose of defining who may be a Chapter 9 debtor, an unmistakable reference to the \xc2\xa7109 gateway provision.  This conclusion is reinforced by the definition\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdefining who may be a debtor under chapter 9,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(52), which is tantamount to barring Puerto Rico from \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authorizing\xe2\x80\x9d which municipalities may file Chapter 9 petitions under the gateway provision, \xc2\xa7903(1).  The text of the exclusion thus extends no further.  Had Congress intended to exclude Puerto Rico from Chapter 9 altogether, including Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision, Congress would have said so.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d does not exclude Puerto Rico from all of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  First, Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion as a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision does not also remove Puerto Rico from Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s separate pre-emption provision.  A State that chooses under the gateway provision not to authorize a municipality to file is still bound by the pre-emption provision.  Likewise, Puerto Rico is bound by the pre-emption provision, even though Congress has removed its authority under the gateway provision to authorize its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief.  Second, because Puerto Rico was not \xe2\x80\x9cby definition\xe2\x80\x9d excluded from Chapter 9, both \xc2\xa7903\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause and its proviso, the pre-emption provision, continue to apply in Puerto Rico.  Finally, the argument that the Recovery Act is not a \xe2\x80\x9cState law\xe2\x80\x9d that can be pre-empted is based on technical amendments to the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccreditor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x9d that are too \xe2\x80\x9csubtle\xe2\x80\x9d to support such a \xe2\x80\x9c[f]undamental chang[e] in the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  <i>Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel.

We must decide whether Puerto Rico is a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of this pre-emption provision.  We hold that it is.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Bankruptcy Code has long included Puerto Rico as a \xe2\x80\x9cState,\xe2\x80\x9d but in 1984 Congress amended the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude Puerto Rico \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act, \xc2\xa7421(j)(6),\n\n98Stat.\n368, now codified at\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(52).  Puerto Rico interprets this amended definition to mean that Chapter 9 no longer applies to it, so it is no longer a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  We hold that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 exclusion of Puerto Rico from the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d in the amended definition does not sweep so broadly.  By excluding Puerto Rico \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of <i>defining who may be a debtor</i> <i>under chapter 9</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(52) (emphasis added), the Code prevents Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief.  Without that authorization, Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities cannot qualify as Chapter 9 debtors.  \xc2\xa7109(c)(2).  But Puerto Rico remains a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for other purposes related to Chapter 9, including that chapter\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  That provision bars Puerto Rico from enacting its own municipal bankruptcy scheme to restructure the debt of its insolvent public utilities companies.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities are in the midst of a fiscal crisis.  More than $20 billion of Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s climbing debt is shared by three government-owned public utilities companies: the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, and the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority.  For the fiscal year ending in 2013, the three public utilities operated with a combined deficit of $800 million.  The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (Bank)\xe2\x80\x94the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s government-owned bank and fiscal agent\xe2\x80\x94has previously provided financing to enable the utilities to continue operating without defaulting on their debt obligations.

Petitioners interpret the amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude Puerto Rico altogether from Chapter 9.  If petitioners are correct, then the pre-emption provision does not apply to them.  Puerto Rico, in other words, may enact its own municipal bankruptcy scheme without running afoul of the Code.  Respondents, on the other hand, read the amended definition narrowly.  They contend that the definition precludes Puerto Rico from \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authoriz[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d its municipalities to seek relief, as required by the gateway provision, \xc2\xa7109(c)(2), but that Puerto Rico is no less a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the pre-emption provision than the other \xe2\x80\x9cState[s],\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in the Code.  If respondents are correct, then the pre-emption provision applies to Puerto Rico and bars it from enacting the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents have the better reading.  We hold that Puerto Rico is still a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the pre-emption provision.  The 1984 amendment precludes Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek relief under Chapter 9, but it does not remove Puerto Rico from the reach of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The plain text of the Bankruptcy Code begins and ends our analysis.  Resolving whether Puerto Rico is a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the pre-emption provision begins \xe2\x80\x9cwith the language of the statute itself,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cis also where the inquiry should end,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235,\n241 (1989)\n.  And because the statute \xe2\x80\x9ccontains an express pre-emption clause,\xe2\x80\x9d we do not invoke any presumption against pre-emption but instead \xe2\x80\x9cfocus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emptive intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chamber of Commerce of United States of America </i>v. <i>Whiting</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 582,\n594 (2011)\n (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Gobeille </i>v. <i>Liberty Mut.

That exception unmistakably refers to the gateway provision in \xc2\xa7109, titled \xe2\x80\x9cwho may be a debtor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 109(c) begins, \xe2\x80\x9cAn entity may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title if and only if .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7109(c).  We interpret Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the \xe2\x80\x9cwho may be a debtor\xe2\x80\x9d language in the amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to mean that Congress intended to exclude Puerto Rico from this gateway provision delineating who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.  See, <i>e.g., Sullivan </i>v. <i>Stroop</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478,\n484 (1990)\n (reading same term used in different parts of the same Act to have the same meaning); see also <i>Northcross</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools</i>,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 427,\n428 (1973)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]imilarity of language .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a strong indication that the two statutes should be interpreted <i>pari passu</i>\xe2\x80\x9d).  Puerto Rico, therefore, is not a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision, so it cannot perform the single function of the \xe2\x80\x9cState[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under that provision: to \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authoriz[e]\xe2\x80\x9d municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief.  \xc2\xa7109(c).  As a result, Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities cannot satisfy the requirements of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s gateway provision until Congress intervenes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The amended definition\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cdefining\xe2\x80\x9d also confirms our conclusion that the amended definition excludes Puerto Rico as a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision.  The definition specifies that Puerto Rico is not a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the purpose of <i>defining </i>who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101(52) (emphasis added).  To \xe2\x80\x9cdefine\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cto decide upon,\xe2\x80\x9d 4 Oxford English Dictionary 383 (2d ed. 1989), or \xe2\x80\x9cto settle\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto establish or prescribe authoritatively,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 380 (5th ed. 1979).  As discussed, a State\xe2\x80\x99s role under the gateway provision is to do just that: The State must define (or \xe2\x80\x9cdecide upon\xe2\x80\x9d) which entities may seek Chapter 9 relief.  Barring Puerto Rico from \xe2\x80\x9c<i>defining</i> who may be a debtor under chapter 9\xe2\x80\x9d is tantamount to barring Puerto Rico from \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authorizing\xe2\x80\x9d which municipalities may file Chapter 9 petitions under the gateway provision.The amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d unequivocally ex-cludes Puerto Rico as a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the definition extends no further.  The exception excludes Puerto Rico <i>only </i>for purposes of the gateway provision.  Puerto Rico is no less a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the pre-emption provision than it was before Congress amended the definition.  The Code\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision has prohibited States and Territories defined as \xe2\x80\x9cStates\xe2\x80\x9d from enacting their own municipal bankruptcy schemes for 70 years.<i> </i>See\n\n60Stat.\n415 (overturning <i>Faitoute</i>, 316 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 507\xe2\x80\x93509).  Had Congress intended to \xe2\x80\x9calter th[is] fundamental detai[l]\xe2\x80\x9d of municipal bankruptcy, we would expect the text of the amended definition to say so.  <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n468 (2001)\n.

The arguments in support of that capacious reading are unavailing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the dissent agrees with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that the exclusion of Puerto Rico as a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision effectively removed Puerto Rico from all of Chapter 9.  See <i>post</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  To be sure, \xc2\xa7109(c) and the surrounding subsections serve an important gatekeeping role.  Those provisions \xe2\x80\x9cspecify who qualifies\xe2\x80\x94and who does not qualify\xe2\x80\x94as a debtor under the various chapters of the Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Toibb</i> v. <i>Radloff</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157,\n161 (1991)\n.  For instance, a railroad must file under Chapter 11, not Chapter 7, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7109(b)(1), (d), whereas only \xe2\x80\x9cfamily farmer[s] or family fisherm[e]n\xe2\x80\x9d may file under Chapter 12.  The provision delineating who may be a debtor under Chapter 9 is no exception.  Only municipalities may file under Chapter 9, and only if the State has \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authorized\xe2\x80\x9d the municipality to do so.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7109(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2); see also McConnell &amp; Picker, 60 Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 455\xe2\x80\x93461 (discussing the gatekeeping requirements for Chapter 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That Puerto Rico is not a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the gateway provision, however, says nothing about whether Puerto Rico is a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for the other provisions of Chapter 9 involving the States.  The States do not \xe2\x80\x9cpass through\xe2\x80\x9d the gateway provision.  <i>Post, </i>at 8.  The gateway provision is instead directed at the debtors themselves\xe2\x80\x94the municipalities, in the case of Chapter 9 bankruptcy.  A <i>municipality</i> that cannot secure state authorization to file a Chapter 9 petition is excluded from Chapter 9 entirely.  But the same cannot be said about the <i>State</i> in which that municipality is located.  A State\xe2\x80\x99s only role under the gateway provision is to provide that \xe2\x80\x9cauthoriz[ation]\xe2\x80\x9d to file.  \xc2\xa7109(c)(2).  The pre-emption provision then imposes an additional requirement: The States may not enact their own municipal bankruptcy schemes.  A State that chooses not to authorize its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief under the gateway provision is no less bound by that pre-emption provision.  Here too, Puerto Rico is no less bound by the pre-emption provision even though Congress has removed its authority to provide authorization for its municipalities to file Chapter 9 petitions.  Again, if it were Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to also exclude Puerto Rico as a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of that pre-emption provision, it would have said so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, both petitioners and the dissent place great weight on the introductory clause of \xc2\xa7903.  <i>Post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x937.<i> </i>The pre-emption provision cannot apply to Puerto Rico, so goes the argument, because it is a proviso to \xc2\xa7903\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause, which they posit is inapplicable to Puerto Rico.  The introductory clause affirms that Chapter 9 \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not limit or impair the power of a State to control\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipalit[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7903.  The dissent surmises that this clause \xe2\x80\x9cis irrelevant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless\xe2\x80\x9d in Puerto Rico.  <i>Post, </i>at 7.<i> </i>Because Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities are ineligible for Chapter 9 relief, Chapter 9 cannot \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s control over its municipalities,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the dissent.  <i>Ibid</i>.  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no power\xe2\x80\x9d for the introductory clause to \xe2\x80\x9creserve\xe2\x80\x9d for Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s use.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Petitioners likewise contend that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be nonsensical for Congress to provide Puerto Rico with a shield against intrusion by a Chapter that, by definition, can have no effect on Puerto Rico.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner Commonwealth of Puerto Rico et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 15\xe2\x80\x93233, p. 25.  So \xe2\x80\x9cit follows\xe2\x80\x9d that the pre-emption provision, the proviso<i> </i>to that clause, cannot apply either.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>This reading rests on the faulty assumption that Puerto Rico is, \xe2\x80\x9cby definition,\xe2\x80\x9d excluded from Chapter 9.  <i>Ibid</i>.  For all of the reasons already explained, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931, <i>supra</i>, it is not.  The amended definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d precludes Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief.  But Puerto Rico is no less a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7903\xe2\x80\x99s introductory clause and its proviso.  Both continue to apply in Puerto Rico.  They are neither \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 7.  If, for example, Congress created a path for the Puerto Rican municipalities to restructure their debts under Chapter 9, then \xc2\xa7903 would assure Puerto Rico, no less a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d for purposesof this section, of its continued power to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol, bylegislation or otherwise, [its] municipalit[ies] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the exercise of the political or governmental powers of such municipalit[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the Government Development Bank contends that the Recovery Act does not run afoul of the pre-emption provision because the Recovery Act does not bind nonconsenting \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Bankruptcy Code now defines that term.  In 1978, Congress redefined \xe2\x80\x9ccreditor\xe2\x80\x9d to mean an \xe2\x80\x9centity that has a claim against the <i>debtor</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n92Stat.\n2550, now codified at \xc2\xa7101(10) (emphasis added).  A \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, is a \xe2\x80\x9cperson or municipality concerning which a case under this title has been <i>commenced</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 2551, now codified at \xc2\xa7101(13) (emphasis added).  In light of these definitions, the Bank contends that the Puerto Rican municipalities are not \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as the Code defines the term because they cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccommenc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d an action under Chapter 9 without authorization from Puerto Rico.  Brief for Petitioner Acosta-Febo et\xc2\xa0al. 31\xe2\x80\x9333.  And because respondents cannot be \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors\xe2\x80\x9d of a nonexistent \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor,\xe2\x80\x9d the Recovery Act is not a \xe2\x80\x9cState law\xe2\x80\x9d that binds \xe2\x80\x9cany creditor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7903(1).  <i>Id.,</i> at 31\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Tellingly, the dissent does not adopt this reading.  The Bank\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would nullify the pre-emption provision.  Applying the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s logic, a municipality that fails to meet any one of the requirements of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s gatekeeping provision is not a \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x9d and would have no \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  So a State could refuse to \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authoriz[e]\xe2\x80\x9d its municipalities to seek relief under Chapter 9, \xc2\xa7109(c)(2), required to commence a case under that chapter.  That State would be free to enact its own municipal bankruptcy scheme because its municipalities would have no \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law.  The technical amendments to the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9ccreditor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x9d are too \xe2\x80\x9csubtle a move\xe2\x80\x9d to support such a \xe2\x80\x9c[f]undamental chang[e] in the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision.  <i>Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel.

The combined debt of Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s three main public utilities exceeds $20 billion.  These utilities provide power, water, sewer, and transportation to residents of the island.  With rising interest rates and limited access to capital markets, their debts are proving unserviceable.  Soon, Puerto Rico and the utilities contend, they will be unable to pay for things like fuel to generate electricity, which will lead to rolling blackouts.  Other vital public services will be imperiled, including the utilities\xe2\x80\x99 ability to provide safe drinking water, maintain roads, and operate public transportation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When debtors face untenable debt loads, bankruptcy is the primary tool the law uses to forge workable long-term solutions.  By requiring a debtor and creditors to negotiate together and forcing both sides to make concessions within the limits set by law, bankruptcy gives the debtor a \xe2\x80\x9cfresh start,\xe2\x80\x9d discourages creditors from racing each other to sue the debtor, prohibits a small number of holdout creditors from blocking a compromise, protects important creditor rights such as the prioritization of debts, and allows all parties to find equitable and efficient solutions to fiscal problems.  See <i>Marrama</i> v. <i>Citizens Bank of Mass.</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365,\n367 (2007)\n; <i>Young</i> v. <i>Higbee Co.</i>,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204,\n210 (1945)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These concerns are starkly presented in the context of municipal entities like public utilities.  While a business corporation can use bankruptcy to reorganize, and, if that fails, fold up shop and liquidate all of its assets, governments cannot shut down power plants, water, hospitals, sewers, and trains and leave citizens to fend for themselves.  A \xe2\x80\x9cfresh start\xe2\x80\x9d can help not only the unfortunate individual debtor but also\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps especially\xe2\x80\x94the unfortunate municipality and its people.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bekins</i>,\n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27\n\xe2\x80\x9354 (1938).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress has excluded the municipalities of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia from the federal municipal bankruptcy scheme in Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code.  See 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(52), 109(c).  So, in 2014, the Puerto Rican Government enacted the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (Recovery Act or Act).  2014 Laws P.\xc2\xa0R. p. 371.  The Act authorizes Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s public utilities to restructure their debts while continuing to provide essential public services like electricity and water.  Portions of the Act mirror Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code and allow Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s utilities to renegotiate their debts with their creditors.  See <i>ante, </i>at 3.  Like a restructuring plan filed under Chapter 9, a restructuring plan under the Recovery Act that is approved by at least a majority of creditors and a court would be binding on all creditors, including objecting holdouts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the Recovery Act was signed into law, mutual funds and hedge funds holding bonds of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority filed two lawsuits seeking to enjoin Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of the Act.  The District Court held that the Recovery Act could not be enforced because, <i>inter alia</i>, it was prohibited by \xc2\xa7903(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The First Circuit agreed that \xc2\xa7903(1) pre-empted the Act, and did not address whether some provisions of the Act might be unlawful for other reasons.  This Court now affirms.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Bankruptcy is not a one-size-fits-all process.  The Federal Bankruptcy Code sets out specific procedures and governing law for each type of entity that seeks bankruptcy protection.  To see how this approach works, consider the structure of the Code in more depth.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Chapter 1 is the starting point.  It sets out how to read the Code.  See\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq. </i> For example, \xc2\xa7101 sets out general definitions, and \xc2\xa7102 provides rules of construction.  Now skip ahead to \xc2\xa7109, titled, \xe2\x80\x9cWho may be a debtor.\xe2\x80\x9d  That section tells would-be debtors and the interested parties in their bankruptcy which specific bankruptcy laws apply to them.  For example, \xc2\xa7109 tells an ordinary person seeking to restructure her debts to do so using the rules outlined in Chapter 7, \xc2\xa7109(b), or those enumerated in Chapter 13, \xc2\xa7109(e).  It tells a family farm or fisherman to use the rules outlined in Chapter 12.  \xc2\xa7109(f\xc2\xa0).  Certain corporations can use Chapter 7, \xc2\xa7109(b), or Chapter 11, \xc2\xa7109(d).  And a municipality\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy is governed by the rules in Chapter 9.  \xc2\xa7109(c)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because \xc2\xa7109 tells different kinds of debtors which bodies of bankruptcy law apply to them, the Court has described that section as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98gateway\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  Once an entity meets the eligibility requirements for a specific \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d set out in \xc2\xa7109 and elects to pass through that gateway, it becomes subject to the relevant chapter of the Code\xe2\x80\x947, 9, 11, 12, or 13.  The debtor, its creditors, and any other interested parties are governed only by that chapter and the chapters of the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x94like Chapter 1\xe2\x80\x94that apply to all cases.  See \xc2\xa7103; 1 Collier Pamphlet Edition, Bankruptcy Code 2015, p. 59 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general rule, the provisions of the particular chapter apply only in that chapter\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Interpreting statutory provisions in the context of the operative chapters in the Bankruptcy Code in which they appear is not unusual\xe2\x80\x94it is how the Code is designed to work.  For example, both Chapter 9 and Chapter 13 require the debtor to \xe2\x80\x9cfile a plan\xe2\x80\x9d proposing how the court should reorganize its debts.  Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7941\xe2\x80\x93946 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Plan\xe2\x80\x9d under Chapter 9) with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71321\xe2\x80\x931330 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Plan\xe2\x80\x9d under Chapter 13).  But no bankruptcy court or practitioner would suggest that a Chapter 9 \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d also has to satisfy the requirements of Chapter 13.  The Code is read in context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> These cases concern \xc2\xa7109\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d for municipalities.  That provision says that a municipality may file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 if and only if it meets five eligibility criteria.  The debtor must (1) be \xe2\x80\x9ca municipal-ity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7109(c)(1); (2) be \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authorized .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by State law\xe2\x80\x9d to seek bankruptcy restructuring, \xc2\xa7109(c)(2); (3) be \xe2\x80\x9cinsolvent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7109(c)(3); (4) have a \xe2\x80\x9cdesir[e] to effect a plan to adjust\xe2\x80\x9d its debts, \xc2\xa7109(c)(4); and (5) have attempted to negotiate with its creditors, with some exceptions, \xc2\xa7109(c)(5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second eligibility requirement is relevant here.  Only a municipality \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by <i>State </i>law\xe2\x80\x9d may pass through the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d and file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  But Chapter 1\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provision, which applies throughout the Code, provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cterm \xe2\x80\x98State\xe2\x80\x99 includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101(52).  It is undisputed that the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9\xe2\x80\x9d clause is referring to the second eligibility prerequisite in \xc2\xa7109\xe2\x80\x99s gateway provision.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  So, in short, Puerto Rico cannot \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically authoriz[e]\xe2\x80\x9d any of its municipalities to apply for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.  No Puerto Rican municipality will thus satisfy the state authorization requirement of \xc2\xa7109\xe2\x80\x99s gateway for municipalities, and so no Puerto Rican municipality can access Chapter 9.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question in these cases is whether \xc2\xa7903(1), a pre-emption provision in Chapter 9, still applies to Puerto Rico even though its municipalities are not eligible to pass through the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d into Chapter 9.  It should not.  Section 903 by its terms presupposes that Chapter 9 applies only to States who have the power to authorize their municipalities to invoke its protection.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 903 delineates the balance of power between the States that can authorize their municipalities to access Chapter 9 protection and the bankruptcy court that would preside over any municipal bankruptcy commenced under Chapter 9.  To understand that interplay, and why \xc2\xa7903(1) does not pre-empt the Recovery Act, it is important to consider that statutory provision in context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 903, titled \xe2\x80\x9cReservation of State power to control municipalities,\xe2\x80\x9d reads in full:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cThis chapter [Chapter 9] does not limit or impair the power of a State to control, by legislation or otherwise, a municipality of or in such State in the exercise of the political or governmental powers of such municipality, including expenditures for such exercise, but\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) a State law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness of such municipality may not bind any creditor that does not consent to such composition; and</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(2) a judgment entered under such a law may not bind a creditor that does not consent to such composition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This \xe2\x80\x9creservation\xe2\x80\x9d of power to the States was added to the Code in response to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier recognition that States possess plenary control over their municipalities, particularly in fiscal matters.  <i>Faitoute Iron &amp; Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Asbury Park</i>,\n\n316 U.\xc2\xa0S. 502,\n509 (1942)\n, overruled in part by Act of July 1, 1946,\n\n60Stat.\n415.  Section 903 says that States continue to possess those powers not implicated by the bankruptcy itself by noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>Chapter 9, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not limit or impair the power of a State to control\xe2\x80\x9d its municipalities.  \xc2\xa7903.  For example, even if a municipality is in Chapter 9 bankruptcy, a State could still revoke its charter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 903, however, also subjects that broad reservation to an exception articulated in the pre-emption provision that the Court now says bars Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Recovery Act.  States may control their municipalities, but they may not \xe2\x80\x9cprescrib[e] a method of composition of indebtedness of [a] municipality\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cbind[s] any creditor that does not consent to such composition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7903(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this distribution of power between the State and the bankruptcy court is irrelevant to Puerto Rico.  Because Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities cannot pass through the \xc2\xa7109(c) gateway to Chapter 9, nothing in the operation of a Chapter 9 case affects Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s control over its municipalities.  The \xe2\x80\x9creservation\xe2\x80\x9d preamble is therefore meaningless to Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x94there is no power to reserve from Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  And if this preamble does not and cannot apply to Puerto Rico, it follows that \xc2\xa7903(1)\xe2\x80\x99s pro-viso qualifying that reservation of power to the States does not apply to Puerto Rico either.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrow</i>,\n\n266 U.\xc2\xa0S. 531\n\xe2\x80\x93535 (1925).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This understanding of \xc2\xa7903 is fundamentally confirmed by the careful gateway structure the Code sets out for understanding how its chapters work together.  See <i>Utility Air Regulatory Group</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 15) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ords of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120,\n133 (2000)\n)).  Chapter 1\xe2\x80\x99s definitions section prevents Puerto Rico from defining \xe2\x80\x9cwho may be a debtor under chapter 9\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7109(c)\xe2\x80\x99s gateway.  Because of the structure of the Code, that change to Chapter 1\xe2\x80\x99s definition has ripple effects.  By amending the definition of State to exclude Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and their municipalities from \xc2\xa7109(c)\xe2\x80\x99s gateway, Congress excluded Puerto Rico from Chapter 9 for all purposes\xe2\x80\x94it shut the gate and barred it tight.  And because Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s process and rules by their terms can only affect municipalities and States eligible to pass through the gateway in \xc2\xa7109(c), that must mean that none of Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x99s provisions\xe2\x80\x94including \xc2\xa7903\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x94apply to Puerto Rico and its municipalities.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court rejects contextual analysis in favor of a syllogism.  According to the Court, \xc2\xa7903(1) pre-empts all \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d composition laws like Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s that bind nonconsenting municipal creditors.  \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d includes Puerto Rico, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(52), which is a reference to \xc2\xa7109(c).  Thus, according to the Court, while the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d prevents Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 protection under \xc2\xa7109(c), it has no effect on the pre-emption clause in \xc2\xa7903(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning syllogism is not without force.  But it ignores this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated exhortations to read statutes in context of the overall statutory scheme.  <i>Utility Air</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15)<i>.  </i>In context, for the reasons discussed, \xc2\xa7903 is directed to States that can approve their municipalities for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.  Moreover, in an attempt to buttress its syllogism, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis makes an additional critical misstep.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority argues that, in light of the longstanding nature of the \xc2\xa7903(1)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision to preclude state municipal bankruptcy laws, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ad Congress in-tended to \xe2\x80\x98alter this fundamental detail\xe2\x80\x99 of municipal bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x9d to not apply to Puerto Rico, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would expect the text of the amended definition to say so.  Congress \xe2\x80\x98does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (quoting <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n468 (2001)\n; citation and brackets omitted).  But the Court ignores that Congress already<i> </i>altered the fundamental details of municipal bankruptcy when it amended the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude Puerto Rico from authorizing its municipalities to take advantage of Chapter 9.  Nobody has presented a compelling reason for why Congress would have done so, and the legislative history of the amendment is unhelpful.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Under either interpretation the scheme has been fundamentally altered by Congress.  And, in context, the proper understanding of that alteration is that Puerto Rico and its municipalities have been removed entirely from Chapter 9\xe2\x80\x94both from the benefits it provides and from the burden of the pre-emption clause in \xc2\xa7903(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Pre-emption cases may seem like abstract discussions of the appropriate balance between state and federal power.  But they have real-world consequences.  Finding pre-emption here means that a government is left powerless and with no legal process to help its 3.5 million citizens.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress could step in to resolve Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s crisis.  But, in the interim, the government and people of Puerto Rico should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of unreliable electricity, transportation, and safe water\xe2\x80\x94consequences that members of the Executive and Legislature have described as a looming \xe2\x80\x9chumanitarian crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d  The White House, Addressing Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Economic and Fiscal Crisis and Creating a Path to Recovery, p. 1 (Oct. 26, 2015) (italics deleted); Letter from Sen.
