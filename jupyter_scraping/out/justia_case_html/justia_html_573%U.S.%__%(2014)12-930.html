A sponsored individual, known as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a \xe2\x80\x9cfamily preference\xe2\x80\x9d category based on his relationship with the petitioner.  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  The principal beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s spouse and minor children in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, \xe2\x80\x9centitled to the same status\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9corder of consideration\xe2\x80\x9d as the principal.  \xc2\xa71153(d).  The beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of \xe2\x80\x9cpriority date\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, the date a petition was filed.  \xc2\xa71153(e)(1).  Because the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a child seeking to immigrate may \xe2\x80\x9cage out\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e., reach adulthood and lose her immigration status\xe2\x80\x94before she reaches the front of the visa queue.  The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy in that circumstance, providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the age of an alien is determined .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be 21 years of age or older,\xe2\x80\x9d notwithstanding certain allowances for bureaucratic delay, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(h)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed petitions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed petitions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions.  Instead, U.\xc2\xa0S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave the new petitions current priority dates.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 (BIA\xe2\x80\x99s) determination that only those petitions that can be seamlessly converted from one family preference category to another without the need for a new sponsor are entitled to conversion under \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the provision unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">695 F.\xc2\xa03d 1003, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg, concluded that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s textually reasonable construction of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous language was entitled to deference.

See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.  The first clause of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) states a condition that encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition.  The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the first.  It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the beneficiaries described in the first clause.  This remedial prescription directs immigration officials to take the alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition and convert it from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or any new filing.  Moreover, this conversion is to be \xe2\x80\x9cautomati[c]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.  Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s back half are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d entails nothing more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive way immigration law used the term when \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) was enacted.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (2002).  And Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71151(f)(2), (3). </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If the term meant more than that in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference system\xe2\x80\x99s core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified and willing sponsor.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71154(a), (b).  If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor, e.g., the old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify for a new family preference category.  But immigration officials cannot assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on the alien\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes on family preference petitioners.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II).  Nei-ther can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves a new petition\xe2\x80\x94the very thing \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) says is not required.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any case, a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requisite time.  An alien is deemed to age out on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71153(h)(1)(A).  Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the date of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same.  But at that time, the aged-out beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR, and so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old one\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On the above account, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s second clause provides a remedy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out.  In contrast, aliens like respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children\xe2\x80\x94the nieces, nephews, and grandchildren of the initial sponsors\xe2\x80\x94cannot qualify for \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d:  they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with the initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category without obtaining a new sponsor.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The ambiguity created by \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s ill-fitting clauses left the BIA to choose how to reconcile the statute\xe2\x80\x99s different commands.  It reasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of the first clause\xe2\x80\x99s condition.  When an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require this Court to defer.  See National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644\n.

These administrative maneuvers are not in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion,\xe2\x80\x9d they require conversion to occur on a date that has no connection to the alien\xe2\x80\x99s aging out, and they demand administrative juggling to make automatic conversion work.  And that painstakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivative\xe2\x80\x99s parent may never become able to sponsor a visa\xe2\x80\x94and immigration officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (2)\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that the word \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d in the second clause of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion.  But \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d does not necessarily disjoin two phrases, and context suggests that the instructions work in tandem.  In other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting \xe2\x80\x9cconversions,\xe2\x80\x9d retention of a priority date is conditional on a conversion occurring.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71154(k)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading would make priority date retention conditional on something the statute nowhere mentions.  And it would engender unusual results that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that Congress intended.  Pp. 27\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (3)\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents contend that, assuming \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) is ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restrictive reading.  But the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation benefits from administrative simplicity and fits with immigration law\xe2\x80\x99s basic first-come, first-served rule.  By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative beneficiaries, like respondents\xe2\x80\x99 sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for a far longer time.  Pp. 31\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, agreed that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute.  There is no conflict or internal tension in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  The first clause of the provision defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant anything to anyone.  The particular benefit provided by the statute\xe2\x80\x94automatic conversion and retention of priority date\xe2\x80\x94is found exclusively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum, that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary.  Beyond that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be automatically converted.  The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigration system.

Such a sponsored individual is known as the petition\xe2\x80\x99s principal beneficiary.  In turn, any principal beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s minor child\xe2\x80\x94meaning an unmarried child under the age of 21\xe2\x80\x94qualifies as a derivative beneficiary, \xe2\x80\x9centitled to the same [immigration] status\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9corder of consideration\xe2\x80\x9d as his parent.  \xc2\xa71153(d).  Accordingly, when a visa becomes available to the petition\xe2\x80\x99s principal beneficiary, one also becomes available to her minor child.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But what happens if, sometime after the relevant petition was filed, a minor child (whether a principal or a derivative beneficiary) has turned 21\xe2\x80\x94or, in immigration lingo, has \xe2\x80\x9caged out\xe2\x80\x9d?  The immigration process may take years or even decades to complete, due in part to bureaucratic delays associated with reviewing immigration documents and in (still greater) part to long queues for the limited number of visas available each year.  So someone who was a youngster at the start of the process may be an adult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration status given to minors.  The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA),\n\n116Stat.\n927, ensures that the time Government officials have spent processing immigration papers will not count against the beneficiary in assessing his status.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h)(1).  But even with that provision, the beneficiary may age out solely because of the time he spent waiting in line for a visa to become available.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The question presented in this case is whether the CSPA grants a remedy to all aliens who have thus outpaced the immigration process\xe2\x80\x94that is, all aliens who counted as child beneficiaries when a sponsoring petition was filed, but no longer do so (even after excluding administrative delays) by the time they reach the front of the visa queue.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) said no.  It interpreted the CSPA as providing relief to only a subset of that group\xe2\x80\x94specifically, those aged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as principal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only as derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent.  We now uphold the Board\xe2\x80\x99s determination as a permissible construction of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        An alien needs an immigrant visa to enter and permanently reside in the United States.

As a consequence, the principal beneficiary of an approved petition is placed in a queue with others in her category (F1, F2A, or what have you) in order of \xe2\x80\x9cpriority date\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, the date a petition was filed with USCIS.  See \xc2\xa71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.1(b); 22 CFR 42.53(a) (2013).  Every month, the Department of State sets a cut-off date for each family preference category, indicating that visas (sometimes referred to by \xe2\x80\x9cvisanumbers\xe2\x80\x9d) are available for beneficiaries with priority dates earlier than the cut-off.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7245.1(g)(1); 22 CFR \xc2\xa742.51(b).  The system is thus first-come, first-served within each preference category, with visas becoming available in order of priority date.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Such a date may benefit not only the principal beneficiary of a family preference petition, but also her spouse and minor children.  Those persons, labeled the petition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cderivative beneficiar[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9centitled to the same status, and the same order of consideration\xe2\x80\x9d as the principal.  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(d), (h).  Accordingly, when a visa becomes available for the principal, one becomes available for her spouse and minor children too.  And that is so even when (as is usually but not always the case) the spouse and children would not qualify for any family preference category on their own.  For example, the child of an F4 petition\xe2\x80\x99s principal beneficiary is the niece or nephew of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen, and federal immigration law does not recognize that relationship.  Nonetheless, the child can piggy-back on his qualifying parent in seeking an immigrant visa\xe2\x80\x94although, as will be further discussed, he may not immigrate without her.  See 22 CFR \xc2\xa740.1(a)(2); infra, at 6, 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 31\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Once visas become available, the principal and any derivative beneficiaries must separately file visa applications.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71202(a).  Such an application requires an alien to demonstrate in various ways her ad-missibility to the United States.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa71182(a)(1)(A) (alien may not have serious health problems); \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A) (alien may not have been convicted of certain crimes); \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(B) (alien may not have engaged in terrorist activity).  Notably, one necessary showing involves the U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen or LPR who filed the initial petition: To mitigate any possibility of becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic charge,\xe2\x80\x9d the visa applicant (whether a principal or de-rivative beneficiary) must append an \xe2\x80\x9caffidavit of sup-port\xe2\x80\x9d executed by that sponsoring individual.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(4)(C)(ii), 1183a(a)(1).  Such an affidavit legally commits the sponsor to support the alien, usually for at least 10 years, with an annual income \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than125% of the federal poverty line.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71183a(a)(1)(A); see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71183a(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After the beneficiaries have filed their applications, a consular official reviews the documents and, if everything is in order, schedules in-person interviews.  See \xc2\xa71202(h).  The interviews for a principal and her children (or spouse) usually occur back-to-back, although those for the children may also come later.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  The consular official will determine first whether the principal should receive a visa; if (but only if\xc2\xa0) the answer is yes, the official will then consider the derivatives\xe2\x80\x99 applications.  See 22 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa740.1(a)(2), 42.62, 42.81(a).  Provided all goes well, everyone exits the consulate with visas in hand\xe2\x80\x94but that still does not make them LPRs.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71154(e).  Each approved alien must then travel to the United States within a set time, undergo inspection, and confirm her admissibility.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71201(c), 1222, 1225(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Once again, a derivative\xe2\x80\x99s fate is tied to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s: If the principal cannot enter the country, neither can her children (or spouse).  See \xc2\xa71153(d); 22 CFR \xc2\xa740.1(a)(2).  When, but only when, an alien with an immigrant visa is approved at the border does she finally become an LPR.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        All of this takes time\xe2\x80\x94and often a lot of it.

After a sponsoring petition is approved but before a visa application can be filed, a family-sponsored immigrant may stand in line for years\xe2\x80\x94or even decades\xe2\x80\x94just waiting for an immigrant visa to become available.  See, e.g., Dept. of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, 9 Visa Bulletin, Immigrant Numbers for December 2013 (Nov. 8, 2013).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And as the years tick by, young people grow up, and thereby endanger their immigration status.  Remember that not all offspring, but only those under the age of 21 can qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relative\xe2\x80\x9d of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen, or as the principal beneficiary of an LPR\xe2\x80\x99s F2A petition, or (most crucially here) as the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition.  See supra, at 3, 5.  So an alien eligible to immigrate at the start of the process (when a sponsor files a petition) might not be so at the end (when an immigration official reviews his documents for admission).  He may have \xe2\x80\x9caged out\xe2\x80\x9d of his original immigration status by the simple passage of time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2002, Congress enacted the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA),\n\n116Stat.\n927, to address the treatment of those once-but-no-longer-minor aliens.  One section of the Act neatly eliminates the \xe2\x80\x9caging out\xe2\x80\x9d problem for the offspring of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens seeking to immigrate as \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under that provision, the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination of whether [such] an alien satisfies the [immigration law\xe2\x80\x99s] age requirement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be made using [his] age\xe2\x80\x9d on the date the initial petition was filed.\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71151(f\xc2\xa0)(1).  The section thus halts the flow of time for that group of would-be immigrants: If an alien was young when a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen sponsored his entry, then Peter Pan-like, he remains young throughout the immigration process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A different scheme\xe2\x80\x94and one not nearly so limpid\xe2\x80\x94applies to the offspring of LPRs and aliens who initially qualified as either principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions or derivative beneficiaries of any kind of family preference petition.  Section 3 of the CSPA, now codified at\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h), contains three interlinked paragraphs that mitigate the \xe2\x80\x9caging out\xe2\x80\x9d problem for those prospective immigrants.  The first two are complex but, with some perseverance, comprehensible.

See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The months that elapse before USCIS personnel approve a family preference petition (\xe2\x80\x9cthe period during which the applicable petition described in paragraph (2) was pending\xe2\x80\x9d) do not count against an alien in determining his statutory \xe2\x80\x9cage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neither do the months a consular officer lets pass before adjudicating the alien\xe2\x80\x99s own visa application (the period after \xe2\x80\x9can immigrant visa number becomes available for such alien (or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

But the time in between\xe2\x80\x94the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available\xe2\x80\x94is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life.  And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still \xe2\x80\x9cage out\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, turn 21, notwithstanding \xc2\xa71153(h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s dual age adjustments\xe2\x80\x94prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        What happens then (if anything) is the subject of \xc2\xa71153(h)\xe2\x80\x99s third paragraph\xe2\x80\x94the provision at issue in this case.  That paragraph states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9cIf the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, thealien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The provision thus first references the aged-out beneficiaries of family preference petitions, and then directs immigration officials to do something whose meaning this opinion will further consider\xe2\x80\x94i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically convert\xe2\x80\x9d an alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition to an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) addressed the meaning of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) in Matter of Wang, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 28 (2009); its interpretation there is what we review in this case.  Wang was the principal beneficiary of an F4 petition that his sister, a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen, filed in 1992.  At that time, Wang\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was 10 years old, and thus qualified as a derivative beneficiary.  But Wang waited in line for a visa for more than a decade, and by the time his priority date finally came up, his daughter had turned 22 (even after applying \xc2\xa71153(h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s age-reduction formula).  Wang thus obtained a visa for himself, boarded a plane alone, and entered the United States as an LPR.  He then filed a new preference petition on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xe2\x80\x94this one under F2B, the category for LPRs\xe2\x80\x99 adult sons and daughters.  USCIS approved that petition, with a priority date corresponding to the date of Wang\xe2\x80\x99s filing.  Wang contended that under \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), his daughter was instead entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cretain the original priority date\xe2\x80\x9d given to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s old F4 petition, because that petition could \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically be converted\xe2\x80\x9d to the F2B category.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Board rejected that argument. It explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of [\xc2\xa71153(h)(3)] does not expressly state which petitions qualify for automatic conversion and retention of priority dates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 33.  Given that \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity,\xe2\x80\x9d the BIA looked to the \xe2\x80\x9crecognized meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98automatic conversion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in immigration statutes and regulations\xe2\x80\x94which it \xe2\x80\x9cpresume[d]\xe2\x80\x9d Congress understood when enacting the CSPA.  Id., at 33\xe2\x80\x9335.  \xe2\x80\x9cHistorically,\xe2\x80\x9d the BIA showed, that language applied only when apetition could move seamlessly from one family preference category to another\xe2\x80\x94not when a new sponsor was needed to fit a beneficiary into a different category.  Id., at 35.  Some aged-out aliens\xe2\x80\x99 petitions could accomplish that maneuver, because the alien had a qualifying relationship with the original sponsor, and continued to do so upon aging out; in that event, the Board held, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) ensured that the alien would retain his original priority date.  See id., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  But the F4 petition filed by Wang\xe2\x80\x99s sister could not \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically be converted\xe2\x80\x9d in that way because Wang\xe2\x80\x99s daughter never had a qualifying relationship with the sponsor: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o category exists for the niece of a United States citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  That is why Wang himself had to file a new petition on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s behalf once she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling status.  The Board saw no evidence that Congress meant \xe2\x80\x9cto expand the use of the concept[ ] of automatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d to reach such a case.  Id., at 36.  And the Board thought such an expansion unwarranted because it would allow aliens like Wang\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, who lacked any independent entitlement to a visa during the years her father spent standing on the F4 queue, to \xe2\x80\x9ccut[ ] in line ahead of others awaiting visas in other preference categories.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The respondents in this case are similarly situated to Wang, and they seek the same relief.  Each was once the principal beneficiary of either an F3 petition filed by a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen parent or an F4 petition filed by a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen sibling.  Each also has a son or daughter who, on the date of filing, was under 21 and thus qualified as a derivative beneficiary of the petition.  But as was true of Wang\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 offspring had all turned 21 (even accounting for \xc2\xa71153(h)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s age adjustments) by the time visas became available.  Accordingly, the respondents immigrated to the United States alone and, as new LPRs, filed F2B petitions for their sons and daughters.  Each argued that under \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), those petitions should get the same priority date as the original F3 and F4 petitions once had.  USCIS instead gave the new F2B petitions current priority dates, meaning that the sons and daughters could not leapfrog over others in the F2B line.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This case began as two separate suits, one joining many individual plaintiffs and the other certified as a class action.  In each suit, the District Court deferred to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) in Wang, and accordingly granted summary judgment to the Government.  See Zhang v. Napolitano, 663 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (CD Cal. 2009); Costelo v. Chertoff, No. SA08\xe2\x80\x9300688, 2009 WL 4030516 (CD Cal., Nov. 10, 2009).  After consolidating the two cases on appeal, a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed: Like the lower courts, it found \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) ambiguous and acceded to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  656 F.\xc2\xa03d 954, 965\xe2\x80\x93966 (2011).  The Ninth Circuit then granted rehearing en banc and reversed in a 6-to-5 decision.  695 F.\xc2\xa03d 1003 (2012).  The majority concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plain language of the CSPA unambiguously grants automatic conversion and priority date retention to [all] aged-out derivative beneficiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cis not entitled to deference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1006.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), to resolve a Circuit split on the meaning of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3),[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>] and we now reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Principles of Chevron deference apply when the BIA interprets the immigration laws.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93844 (1984); INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415\n\xe2\x80\x93425 (1999).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context,\xe2\x80\x9d where decisions about a complex statu-tory scheme often implicate foreign relations.  Id., at 425.  (Those hardy readers who have made it this far will surely agree with the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity\xe2\x80\x9d point.)  Under Chevron, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning controls, whatever the Board might have to say.  See 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  But if the law does not speak clearly to the question at issue, a court must defer to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation, rather than substitute its own reading.  Id., at 844.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue here\xe2\x80\x94or more precisely put, it addresses that issue in divergent ways.  We might call the provision Janus-faced.  Its first half looks in one direction, toward the sweeping relief the respondents propose, which would reach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition.  But as the BIA recognized, and we will further explain, the section\xe2\x80\x99s second half looks another way, toward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x94and one not including the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 offspring.  The two faces of the statute do not easily cohere with each other: Read either most naturally, and the other appears to mean not what it says.  That internal tension makes possible alternative reasonable constructions, bringing into correspondence in one way or another the section\xe2\x80\x99s different parts.  And when that is so, Chevron dictates that a court defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s choice\xe2\x80\x94here, to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s expert judgment about which interpretation fits best with, and makes most sense of, the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Begin by reading the statute from the top\xe2\x80\x94the part favoring the respondents.  Section 1153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s first clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94states a condition that every aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies.  That is because all those beneficiaries have had their ages \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined under paragraph (1)\xe2\x80\x9d (and have come up wanting): Recall that the age formula of \xc2\xa71153(h)(1) applies to each alien child who originally qualified (under \xe2\x80\x9csubsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\xe2\x80\x9d) as the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition or the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition.  On its own, then, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s opening clause encompasses the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 sons and daughters, along with every other once-young beneficiary of a family preference petition now on the wrong side of 21.  If the next phrase said something like \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien shall be treated as though still a minor\xe2\x80\x9d (much as the CSPA did to ensure U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens\xe2\x80\x99 children, qualifying as \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relatives,\xe2\x80\x9d would stay forever young, see supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x938), all those aged-out beneficiaries would prevail in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But read on, because \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s second clause instead prescribes a remedy containing its own limitation on the eligible class of recipients.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition,\xe2\x80\x9d that part provides, \xe2\x80\x9cshall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date.\xe2\x80\x9d  That statement directs immigration officials to take the initial petition benefitting an alien child, and now that he has turned 21, \xe2\x80\x9cconvert[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d that same petition from a category for children to an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category\xe2\x80\x9d for adults (while letting him keep the old priority date).  The \xe2\x80\x9cconversion,\xe2\x80\x9d in other words, is merely from one category to another; it does not entail any change in the petition, including its sponsor, let alone any new filing.  And more, that category shift is to be \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.  See, e.g., Random House Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Unabridged Dictionary 140 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9chaving the capability of starting, operating, moving, etc., independently\xe2\x80\x9d); The American Heritage Dictionary 122 (4th ed. 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]cting or operating in a manner essentially independent of external influence\xe2\x80\x9d).  The operation described is, then, a mechanical cut-and-paste job\xe2\x80\x94moving a petition, without any substantive alteration, from one (no-longer-appropriate, child-based) category to another (now-appropriate, adult) compartment.  And so the aliens who may benefit from \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s back half are only those for whom that procedure is possible.  The clause offers relief not to every aged-out beneficiary, but just to those covered by petitions that can roll over, seamlessly and promptly, into a category for adult relatives.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That understanding of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d language matches the exclusive way immigration law used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA.  For many years before then (as today), a regulation entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAutomatic conversion of preference classification\xe2\x80\x9d instructed immigration officials to change the preference category of a petition\xe2\x80\x99s principal beneficiary when either his or his sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s status changed in specified ways.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7204.2(i)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (2002).  For example, the regulation provided that when a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen\xe2\x80\x99s child aged out, his \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relative\xe2\x80\x9d petition converted to an F1 petition, with his original priority date left intact.  See \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(2).  Similarly, when a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen\xe2\x80\x99s adult son married, his original petition migrated from F1 to F3, see \xc2\xa7204.2(i) (1)(i); when, conversely, such a person divorced, his petition converted from F3 to F1, see \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(1)(iii); and when a minor child\xe2\x80\x99s LPR parent became a citizen, his F2A petition became an \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relative\xe2\x80\x9d petition, see \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(3)\xe2\x80\x94all again with their original priority dates.  Most notable here, what all of those authorized changes had in common was that they could occur without any change in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s identity, or otherwise in the petition\xe2\x80\x99s content.  In each circumstance, the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d entailed nothing more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it into another for which the alien now qualified.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d (even without the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d) in the identical way in two other sections of the CSPA.  See Law v. Siegel, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 7) (2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ords repeated in different parts of the same statute generally have the same meaning\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 2 refers to occasions on which, by virtue of the above-described regulation, a petition \xe2\x80\x9cconverted\xe2\x80\x9d from F2A to the \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relative\xe2\x80\x9d category because of the sponsor parent\xe2\x80\x99s naturalization, or from the F3 to theF1 box because of the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s divorce.  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71151(f\xc2\xa0)(2), (3).  Then, in \xc2\xa76, Congress authorized an additional conversion of the same nature: It directed that when an LPR parent-sponsor naturalizes, the petition he has filed for his adult son or daughter \xe2\x80\x9cshall be converted,\xe2\x80\x9d unless the beneficiary objects, from the F2B to the F1 compartment\xe2\x80\x94again with the original priority date unchanged.  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71154(k)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  (That opt-out mechanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature of the conversion.)  Once again, in those cases, all that is involved is a recategorization\xe2\x80\x94moving the same petition, filed by the same petitioner, from one preference classification to another, so as to reflect a change in either the alien\xe2\x80\x99s or his sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s status.  In the rest of the CSPA, as in the prior immigration regulation, that is what \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d means.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And if the term meant more than that in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference system\xe2\x80\x99s core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified sponsor.  Consider the alternative addressed in Wang\xe2\x80\x94if \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d were also to encompass the substitution of a new petitioner for the old one, to make sure the aged-out alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition fits into a new preference category.  In a case like Wang, recall, the original sponsor doesnot have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out derivative beneficiary (they are aunt and niece); accordingly, the derivative\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x94the old principal beneficiary\xe2\x80\x94must be swapped in as the petitioner to enable his daughter to immigrate.  But what if, at that point, the father is in no position to sponsor his daughter?  Suppose he decided in the end not to immigrate, or failed to pass border inspection, or died in the meanwhile.  Or suppose he entered the country, but cannot sponsor a relative\xe2\x80\x99s visa because he lacks adequate proof of parentage or committed a disqualifying crime. See \xc2\xa71154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(d)(2); supra, at 4.  Or suppose he does not want to\xe2\x80\x94or simply cannot\xe2\x80\x94undertake the significant financial obligations that the law imposes on someone petitioning for an alien\xe2\x80\x99s admission.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71183a(a)(1)(A), (f\xc2\xa0)(1)(D); supra, at 5.  Immigration officials cannot assume away all those potential barriers to entry: That would run counter to the family preference system\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that a qualified and willing sponsor back every immigrant visa.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71154(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  But neither can they easily, or perhaps at all, figure out whether such a sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves a new petition\xe2\x80\x94the very thing \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) says is not required.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, in cases like Wang, the problem is broader: Under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s most natural reading, a new qualified sponsor will hardly ever exist at the moment the petition is to be \xe2\x80\x9cconverted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1153(h)(3), to be sure, does not explicitly identify that point in time.  But \xc2\xa71153(h)(1) specifies the date on which a derivative beneficiary is deemed to have either aged out or not: It is \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(h)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B).  Because that statutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers automatic conversion for eligible aliens, the date of conversion is best viewed as the same.  That reading, more-over, comports with the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d regulation on which Congress drew in enacting the CSPA, see supra, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317: The rule authorizes conversions \xe2\x80\x9cupon\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cas of the date\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant change in the alien\xe2\x80\x99s status (including turning 21))\xe2\x80\x94regardless when  USCIS may receive notice of the change.  8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i); but cf. post, at 14 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (wrongly stating that under that rule conversion occurs upon the agency\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of proof of the change).  But on that date, no new petitioner will be ready to step into the old one\xe2\x80\x99s shoes if such a substitution is needed to fit an aged-out beneficiary into a different category.  The beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s parent, on the day a \xe2\x80\x9cvisa number became available,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot yet be an LPR or citizen; by definition, she has just become eligible to apply for a visa, and faces a wait of at least several months before she can sponsor an alien herself.  Nor, except in a trivial number of cases, is any hitherto unidentified person likely to have a legally recognized relationship to the alien.  So if an aged-out beneficiary has lost his qualifying connection to the original petitioner, no conversion to an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category\xe2\x80\x9d can take place at the requisite time.  As long as immigration law demands some valid sponsor, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) cannot give such an alien the designated relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On the above account\xe2\x80\x94in which conversion entails a simple reslotting of an original petition into a now-appropriate category\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s back half provides a remedy to two groups of aged-out beneficiaries.  First, any child who was the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition (filed by an LPR parent on his behalf) can take advantage of that clause after turning 21.  He is, upon aging out, the adult son of the same LPR who sponsored him as a child; his petition can therefore be moved seamlessly\xe2\x80\x94without the slightest alteration or delay\xe2\x80\x94into the F2B category.  Second, any child who was the derivative beneficiary of an F2A petition (filed by an LPR on his spouse\xe2\x80\x99s behalf) can similarly claim relief, provided that under the statute, he is not just the spouse\xe2\x80\x99s but also the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s child.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  Such an alien is identically situated to the aged-out principal beneficiary of an F2A petition; indeed, for the price of another filing fee, he could just as easily have been named a principal himself.  He too is now the adult son of the original LPR petitioner, and his petition can also be instantly relabeled an F2B petition, without any need to substitute a new sponsor or make other revisions.  In each case, the alien had a qualifying relationship before he was 21 and retains it afterward; all that must be changed is the label affixed to his petition.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In contrast, as the Board held in Wang, the aged-out derivative beneficiaries of the other family preference categories\xe2\x80\x94like the sons and daughters of the respondents here\xe2\x80\x94cannot qualify for \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Recall that the respondents themselves were principal beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions; their children, when under 21, counted as derivatives, but lacked any qualifying preference relationship of their own.  The F3 derivatives were the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 grandsons and granddaughters; the F4 derivatives their nephews and nieces; and none of those are relationships Congress has recognized as warranting a family preference.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  Now that the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children have turned 21, and they can no longer ride on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 coattails, that lack of independent eligibility makes a difference.  For them, unlike for the F2A beneficiaries, it is impossible simply to slide the original petitions from a (no-longer-appropriate) child category to a (now-appropriate) adult one.  To fit into a new category, those aged-out derivatives, like Wang\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, must have new sponsors\xe2\x80\x94and for all the reasons already stated, that need means they cannot benefit from \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        All that said, we hold only that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) permits\xe2\x80\x94not that it requires\xe2\x80\x94the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to so distinguish among aged-out beneficiaries.  That is because, as we explained earlier, the two halves of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) face in different directions.  See supra, at 14.  Section 1153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s first part\xe2\x80\x94its conditional phrase\xe2\x80\x94encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition, and thus points toward broad-based relief.  But as just shown, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s second part\xe2\x80\x94its remedial prescription\xe2\x80\x94applies only to a narrower class of beneficiaries: those aliens who naturally qualify for (and so can be \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically converted\xe2\x80\x9d to) a new preference classification when they age out.  Were there an interpretation that gave each clause full effect, the Board would have been required to adopt it.  But the ambiguity those ill-fitting clauses create instead left the Board with a choice\xe2\x80\x94essentially of how to reconcile the statute\xe2\x80\x99s different commands.  The Board, recognizing the need to make that call, opted to abide by the inherent limits of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of the section\xe2\x80\x99s initial condition.  On the Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned view, the only beneficiaries entitled to statutory relief are those capable of obtaining the remedy designated.  When an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require us to defer.  See National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644,\n666 (2007)\n (When a statutory scheme contains \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental ambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d arising from \xe2\x80\x9cthe differing mandates\xe2\x80\x9d of two provisions, \xe2\x80\x9cit is appropriate to look to the implementing agency\xe2\x80\x99s expert interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d to determine which \xe2\x80\x9cmust give way\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The respondents urge us to overturn the Board\xe2\x80\x99s judgment for three independent reasons.  First, and principally, they take issue with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and now our\xe2\x80\x94viewof the limits associated with \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d: They argue that every aged-out beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s petition can \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically be converted\xe2\x80\x9d to an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the two halves of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) are thus reconcilable.  Second, the respondents contend that even if \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d does not extend so far, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) separately entitles each such beneficiary to the benefit of his original petition\xe2\x80\x99s priority date.  And third, they claim that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s way of resolving whatever ambiguity inheres in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) is arbitrary and capricious.  The dissenting opinion reiterates the first two arguments, though with slight variation and in opposite order, while forgoing the third.  See post, at 9\xe2\x80\x9319 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (hereinafter the dissent).  We find none of the contentions persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The respondents (and the dissent) initially aver that every aged-out beneficiary (including their own sons and daughters) can \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically be converted\xe2\x80\x9d to an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d immigration category, if only immigration officials try hard enough.  The Government, in the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, can accomplish that feat by substituting new sponsors for old ones, and by \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging the timing\xe2\x80\x9d of every conversion to ensure such a new petitioner exists on the relevant date.  Brief for Respondents 33.  And because, the respondents say, it is thus possible to align the two halves of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x94even if through multiple administrative maneuvers\xe2\x80\x94immigration officials are under an obligation to do so.  We disagree, for reasons that should sound familiar: Several are the same as those we have just given for upholding the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  But still, we walk through the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument step-by-step, to show how far it departs from any ordinary understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first (and necessary) premise of that argument does not augur well for the remainder: It is the view that the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d procedure permits a change in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  According to the respondents, the aged-out beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 parents, upon becoming LPRs, can be subbed in for the original sponsors (i.e., the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 grandparents, aunts, and uncles), and the petitions then converted to the F2B category.  But as we have shown, the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d language\xe2\x80\x94as most naturally read and as long used throughout immigration law\xe2\x80\x94contemplates merely moving a petition into a new and valid category, not changing its most essential feature.  See supra, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  That alone defeats the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And a further problem follows\xe2\x80\x94this one concerning the date of automatic conversion.  The respondents need that date to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 parents (the substitute petitioners) are already living in the United States as LPRs; otherwise, the petitions could not qualify for the F2B box.  In an attempt to make that possible, the respondents propose that conversion be viewed as taking place when \xe2\x80\x9cthe derivative beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s visa . . . application is adjudicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 29.  But as we have (again) demonstrated, the statute is best read as establishing a different date: that \xe2\x80\x9con which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when, by definition, the parent is not yet an LPR.  \xc2\xa71153(h)(1); see supra, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  That is the moment when a derivative ages out, which is the single change conversion reflects.  By contrast, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis; the date of adjudication is merely when an immigration official later discovers that a child has turned 21.  And that date is itself fortuitous, reflecting no more than when an immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa application: The possibility of conversion would thus depend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa process.  So the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 mistaken view of the timing of conversion is another off-ramp from their argument.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Yet there is more\xe2\x80\x94because even after substituting a new petitioner and delaying the conversion date in a way the statute does not contemplate, the respondents must propose yet further fixes to make \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d conversion work for their sons and daughters.  The respondents\xe2\x80\x99 next problem is that even on the conversion date they propose, most of them (and other derivatives\xe2\x80\x99 parents) were not yet LPRs, and so could not possibly be sponsors.  In the ordinary course, principal and derivative beneficiaries living abroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the consulate together for back-to-back interviews.  See supra, at 6.  And even if the parent is approved first, that alone does not make her an LPR; she still must come to this country, demonstrate her continued eligibility, and pass an inspection.  See ibid.  Thus, the respondents must recommend changes to the visa process to get the timing to work\xe2\x80\x94essentially, administrative juggling to hold off the derivative beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s visa adjudication until his parent has become an LPR.  In particular, they suggest that the consular official defer the derivative\xe2\x80\x99s interview, or that the official nominally \xe2\x80\x9creject the application\xe2\x80\x9d and then instruct the derivative to \xe2\x80\x9creapply after the principal beneficiary immigrates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 30.  But the need for that choreography (which, in any event, few if any of the respondents conformed to) renders the conversion process only less \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic,\xe2\x80\x9d because now it requires special intervention, purposeful delay, and deviation from standard administrative practice.  Conversion has become not a machine that would go of itself, but a process painstakingly managed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And after all this fancy footwork, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 scheme still cannot succeed, because however long a visa adjudication is postponed, a derivative\xe2\x80\x99s parent may never become able to sponsor a relative\xe2\x80\x99s visa\xe2\x80\x94and immigration officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so.  We have noted before the potential impediments to serving as a petitioner\xe2\x80\x94including that a parent may not immigrate, may not qualify as a sponsor, or may not be able to provide the requisite financial support.  See supra, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The respondents offer no way to deal with those many contingencies.  Require the parent to submit a new petition?  But the entire point of automatic conversion (as the respondents themselves agree) is to obviate the need for such a document.  See Brief for Respondents 30, 42.  Investigate the parent\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility in some other way?  But even were that possible (which we doubt) such an inquiry would not square with the essential idea of an automatic process.  Disregard the possibility that no legal sponsor exists?  But then visas would go, inevitably and not infrequently, to ineligible aliens.  And so the workarounds have well and truly run out on the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That leaves us with the same statutory inconsistency with which we began.  Having followed each step of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 resourceful (if Rube Goldbergish) argument, we still see no way to apply the concept of automatic conversion to the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children and others like them.  And that means we continue to face a statute whose halves do not correspond to each other\xe2\x80\x94giving rise to an ambiguity that calls for Chevron deference.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The respondents, however, have another idea for reconciling \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s front and back parts (and this back-up claim becomes the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s principal argument).  Recall that the section\xe2\x80\x99s remedial clause instructs that \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  The respondents (and the dissent) ask us to read the italicized language as conferring a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion.  On that view, aged-out derivatives, even though ineligible for conversion, could \xe2\x80\x9cretain the[ir] original priority date[s]\xe2\x80\x9d if their parents file a new petition (as the respondents in fact did here \xe2\x80\x9cas a protective matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 55).  And then, everyone encompassed in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s first clause would get at least some form of relief (even if not both forms) from the section\xe2\x80\x99s second.  For this argument, the respondents principally rely on the word \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the word \xe2\x80\x98and\xe2\x80\x99 connects two\xe2\x80\x9d phrases as in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s back half, the respondents contend, those terms \xe2\x80\x9coperate independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 39; see post, at 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d does not necessarily disjoin two phrases in the way the respondents say.  In some sentences, no doubt, the respondents have a point.  They use as their primary example: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the boat takes on water, then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall distribute life jackets.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 39; see also post, at 10 (offering further examples).  We agree that \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall distribute life jackets\xe2\x80\x9d functions in that sentence as an independent command.  But we can come up with many paired dictates in which the second is conditional on the first.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the price is reasonable, buy two tickets and save a receipt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have time this summer, read this book and give me a report.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or, shades of this case: \xe2\x80\x9cIf your cell-phone contract expires, buy a new phone and keep the old number.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]  In each case, the second command functions only once the first is accomplished.  Whether \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d works in that way or in the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 depends, like many questions of usage, on the context.  See, e.g., Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Here, we think, context compels the Board\xe2\x80\x99s view that the instructions work in tandem.  The first phrase instructs immigration officials to convert a petition (when an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category\xe2\x80\x9d exists); the next clarifies that such a converted petition will retain the original priority date, rather than receive a new one corresponding to the date of conversion.  That reading comports with the way retention figures in other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting \xe2\x80\x9cconversions\xe2\x80\x9d; there too, retention of a priority date is conditional on a conversion occurring.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71154(k)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i); supra, at 16.  The respondents wish to unhook the \xe2\x80\x9cretention\xe2\x80\x9d phrase from that mooring, and use it to explain what will attend a different event\xe2\x80\x94that is, the filing of a new petition.  But that is to make \xe2\x80\x9cretention\xe2\x80\x9d conditional on something the statute nowhere mentions\xe2\x80\x94a highly improbable thing for Congress to have done.  (If, once again, a teacher says to \xe2\x80\x9cread this book and give me a report,\xe2\x80\x9d no one would think he wants a report on some unidentified subject.)  And indeed, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and dissent\xe2\x80\x99s own examples prove this point: In not a single one of their proffered sentences is the second command contingent on the occurrence of some additional, unstated event, as it would have to be under the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 construction of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3); rather, each such command (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute life jackets\xe2\x80\x9d) flows directly from the stated condition (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cif the boat takes on water\xe2\x80\x9d).  So by far the more natural understanding of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s text is that retention follows conversion, and nothing else.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary view would also engender unusual results, introducing uncertainty into the immigration system\xe2\x80\x99s operation and thus interfering with statutory goals.  Were their theory correct, an aged-out alien could hold on to a priority date for years or even decades while waiting for a relative to file a new petition.  Even if that filing happened, say, 20 years after the alien aged out, the alien could take out his priority-date token, and assert a right to spring to the front of any visa line.  At that point, USCIS could well have a hard time confirming the old priority date, in part because the names of derivative beneficiaries need not be listed on a visa petition.  And the possibility of such leap-frogging from many years past would impede USCIS\xe2\x80\x99s publication of accurate waiting times.  As far as we know, immigration law nowhere else allows an alien to keep in his pocket a priority date untethered to any existing valid petition.  Without some clearer statement, we cannot conclude Congress intended here to create such a free-floating, open-ended entitlement to a defunct petition\xe2\x80\x99s priority date.  See Wang, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 36.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, the respondents contend that even if \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) points at once in two directions\xe2\x80\x94toward a broader scope in its first half and a narrower one in its second\xe2\x80\x94the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restrictive reading.  In their view, the Board has offered no valid reason, consistent with \xe2\x80\x9cthe purposes and concerns of the immigration laws,\xe2\x80\x9d to treat their own sons and daughters less favorably than aliens who were principal and derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions.  Brief for Respondents 47.  Indeed, the respondents suggest that the BIA, \xe2\x80\x9cfor its own unfathomable reasons, disapproves of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow any aged-out\xe2\x80\x9d aliens to get relief, and has thus \xe2\x80\x9climited [\xc2\xa71153(h)(3)] to as few derivative beneficiaries as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 55.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We cannot agree.  At the least, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation has administrative simplicity to recommend it.  Under that view, immigration authorities need only perform the kind of straightforward (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic\xe2\x80\x9d) conversion they have done for decades\xe2\x80\x94moving a petition from one box to another to reflect a given status change like aging out.  See Wang, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 36.  The respondents, as we have shown, would transform conversion into a managed, multi-stage process, requiring immigration and consular officials around the world to sequence and delay every aged-out alien\xe2\x80\x99s visa adjudication until they are able to confirm that one of his parents had become a qualifying and willing F2B petitioner.  And according to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s (incomplete) statistics, that would have to happen in, at a minimum, tens of thousands of cases every year.  See Reply Brief 18, n. 13.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Still more important, the Board offered a cogent argument, reflecting statutory purposes, for distinguishing between aged-out beneficiaries of F2A petitions and the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 sons and daughters.  See Wang, 35 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 38.  As earlier explained, the F2A beneficiaries have all had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for the entire period they have waited in line\xe2\x80\x94i.e., since their original priority dates.  See supra, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  That means that when immigration authorities convert their petitions, they will enter the F2B line at the same place as others who have had a comparable relationship for an equal time.  The conversion thus fits with the immigration law\xe2\x80\x99s basic first-come-first-served rule.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(e); supra, at 4.  By contrast, the derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions, like the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 sons and daughters, lacked any qualifying relationship with a citizen or LPR during the period they waited in line.  See supra, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  They were, instead, the grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of citizens, and those relationships did not independently entitle them to visas.  If such aliens received relief under \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), they would jump over thousands of others in the F2B line who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for a far longer time.  That displacement would, the Board reasonably found, scramble the priority order Congress prescribed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The argument to the contrary assumes that the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 sons and daughters should \xe2\x80\x9creceive credit\xe2\x80\x9d for all the time the respondents themselves stood in line.  Brief for Respondents 50.  But first, the time the respondents spent waiting for a visa may diverge substantially from the time their children did.  Suppose, for example, that one of the respondents had stood in the F4 queue for 15 years, and with just 4 years to go, married someone with a 17-year-old son.  Under the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading, that derivative beneficiary, after aging out, would get the full benefit of his new parent\xe2\x80\x99s wait, and so displace many thousands of aliens who (unlike him) had stood in an immigration queue for nearly two decades.  And second, even when the derivative qualified as such for all the time his parent stood in line, his status throughout that period hinged on his being that parent\xe2\x80\x99s minor child.  If his parent had obtained a visa before he aged out, he would have been eligible for a visa too, because the law does not demand that a prospective immigrant abandon a minor child.  But if the parent had died while waiting for a visa, or had been found ineligible, or had decided not to immigrate after all, the derivative would have gotten nothing for the time spent in line.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Similarly, the Board could reasonably conclude, he should not receive credit for his parent\xe2\x80\x99s wait when he has become old enough to live independently.  In the unavoidably zero-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the Board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who has had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This is the kind of case Chevron was built for.  What-ever Congress might have meant in enacting \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), it failed to speak clearly.  Confronted with a self-contradictory, ambiguous provision in a complex statutory scheme, the Board chose a textually reasonable construction consonant with its view of the purposes and policies underlying immigration law.  Were we to overturn the Board in that circumstance, we would assume as our own the responsible and expert agency\xe2\x80\x99s role.

And next, the dissent cites a regulation that post-dated the CSPA by years, and thus is equally irrelevant to what Congress intended.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 35732, 35749 (2006) (adding 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(1)(iv)).  More-over, both provisions relate to a  circumstance in which a person can -petition for a visa because her U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen or LPR relative either died or engaged in domestic abuse.

As an initial matter, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s objection to assessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on an imaginary difficulty.  That approach, the dissent complains, cannot be right because that date always \xe2\x80\x9coccurs before the point at which the child is determined to have aged-out.\xe2\x80\x9d   at 15Well, yes.  The date a visa becomes available is, under the statute, the date an alien ages out (or not); and that status change of course occurs before an immigration official, reviewing a visa application, finds that it has done so.  But what of it?  When an official determines that an alien was no longer a child on the date a visa became available, he also assesses whether automatic conversion was available to the alien that prior date.  In other words, here as elsewhere in immigration law, conversion occurs (or not) upon the date of the relevant status change\xe2\x80\x94and no other.  See  at 19.  And once that is understood, the supposed difficulties the dissent throws up all melt away.  At the time of the status change, F2A petitions can be converted without further contingencies, decisions, or delays, whereas no other petitions can.  But cf. at 16, 17, n.\xc2\xa07 (countering, irrelevantly, that an F2A petition is automatically converted, additional steps remain in the immigration process).  And immigration officials later reviewing visa applications know that fact, and can treat the different classes of aged-out beneficiaries accordingly.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">14</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Nor does the dissent offer any serious aid to the respondents.  The dissent initially acknowledges that automatic conversion cannot involve \xe2\x80\x9cadditional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\xe2\x80\x9d  , at 13.  But no worries, the dissent continues: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce [an alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent] provides confirmation of her eligibility to sponsor\xe2\x80\x9d the aged-out alien, the original petition \xe2\x80\x9ccan automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency\xe2\x80\x9d or (presumably) delay.  ,at 14.  Think about that: Once every decision, contingency, and delay we have just described is over (and a parent has at long last turned out to be a viable sponsor), the dissent assures us that no further decisions, contingencies, and delays remain.  Or, put differently, there are no contingencies after all the contingencies have been resolved; no decisions after all the decisions have been made; and no delay after all the delay has transpired.  And as if that argument were not awkward enough, consider that it would make automatic conversion turn on the filing of a new document that shows the parent\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility to sponsor her aged-out son or daughter\xe2\x80\x94the very thing, as all parties agree, that conversion is supposed to render unnecessary.

See at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.

And the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s citation of  v. ,\n, adds nothing to its argument.  There, we construed the following provision: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here shall be allowed to the holder of [a secured] claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  , at 241.

The dissent principally relies on 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(a)(4), which prior to the CSPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment permitted an aged-out F2A derivative beneficiary to retain his old priority date \xe2\x80\x9cif [a] subsequent petition is filed \xe2\x80\x9d as filed the original.

For the plurality, the first clause looks \xe2\x80\x9ctoward the sweeping relief the respondents propose, which would reach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition,\xe2\x80\x9d while the second clause offers narrower relief that can help \xe2\x80\x9conly a subset of those beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cill-fitting clauses,\xe2\x80\x9d the plurality says, \xe2\x80\x9cleft the Board with a choice\xe2\x80\x94essentially of how to reconcile the statute\xe2\x80\x99s different commands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 21.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To the extent the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion could be read to suggest that deference is warranted because of a direct conflict between these clauses, that is wrong.  Courts defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable construction of an ambiguous statute because we presume that Congress intended to assign responsibility to resolve the ambiguity to the agency.  Chevron, supra, at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  But when Congress assigns to an agency the responsibility for deciding whether a particular group should get relief, it does not do so by simultaneously saying that the group should and that it should not.  Direct conflict is not ambiguity, and the resolution of such a conflict is not statutory construction but legislative choice.  Chevron is not a license for an agency to repair a statute that does not make sense.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I see no conflict, or even \xe2\x80\x9cinternal tension,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, in section 1153(h)(3).

But the clause does not grant anything to anyone.  I disagree with the plurality that the first clause \xe2\x80\x9cpoints toward broad-based relief,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 21, because I do not think the first clause points toward any relief at all.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Imagine a provision of the Tax Code that read: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a student is determined to be enrolled at an accredited university, the student\xe2\x80\x99s cost of off-campus housing shall be deductible on her tax return.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would be immediately apparent from that provision that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even though the student falls within the conditional first clause.  And yet no one would describe the two clauses as being in tension.  If the Internal Revenue Service then interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9ccost of off-campus housing\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude payments by a student who rents a home from his parents, a court would determine whether that interpretation was reasonable.  The same is true in this case.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The particular benefit provided by section 1153(h)(3) is found exclusively in the second clause\xe2\x80\x94the only operative provision.

But automatic conversion is not possible for every beneficiary in every preference category, as the plurality convincingly demonstrates.  Ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.  Automatic conversion requires, at minimum, that the beneficiary have his own sponsor, who demonstrates that he is eligible to act as a sponsor, and who commits to providing financial support for the beneficiary.  Ante, at 18.  Some aged-out children will not meet those prerequisites, and they cannot benefit from automatic conversion even under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Beyond those requirements, however, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically be converted.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  Whatever other interpretations of that provision might be possible, it was reasonable, for the reasons explained by the plurality, for the Board to interpret section 1153(h)(3) to provide relief only to a child who was a principal or derivative beneficiary of an F2A petition.  That interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigration system.  Ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9320.  It also avoids the problems that would flow from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed alternative interpretations, including the suggestion that retention of the original priority date provides a benefit wholly separate from automatic conversion.

Which aged-out children are entitled to retain their prior-ity dates: derivative beneficiaries of visa petitions in all five family-preference categories, or derivative beneficiaries of petitions in only one category?  The initial clause of\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) provides a clear answer: Aged-out children may retain their priority dates so long as they meet a single condition\xe2\x80\x94they must be \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be 21 years of age or older for purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d derivative beneficiary status.

See Matter of Wang, 25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 28, 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (2009).  The Court defers to that interpretation today.  In doing so, the Court does not identify any ambiguity in the dispositive initial clause of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  Indeed, it candidly admits that the clause mandates relief for \xe2\x80\x9cevery aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference petition\xe2\x80\x9d in any of the five categories.  Ante, at 21.  The Court nevertheless holds that the BIA was free to ignore this unambiguous text on the ground that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) also offers aged-out derivative beneficiaries a type of relief\xe2\x80\x94automatic conversion\xe2\x80\x94that it thinks can apply only to one of the five categories.  The Court thus perceives a conflict in the statute that, in its view, permits the BIA to override \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s initial eligibility clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to follow a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation: When deciding whether Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically addressed the question at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby leaving no room for an agency to fill a statutory gap, courts must \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret the statute \xe2\x80\x98as a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. coherent regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98fit, if possible, all parts into [a] harmonious whole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  FDA v.

Because the Court and the BIA ignore obvious ways in which \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) can operate as a coherent whole and instead construe the statute as a self-contradiction that was broken from the moment Congress wrote it, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under Chevron, the first question we ask when reviewing an agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statute is whether \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

Congress has spoken directly to the question in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) may petition for certain relatives who reside abroad (known as the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d of such petitions) to receive immigrant visas.   Congress has defined five categories of eligible relatives\xe2\x80\x94referred to as family-preference categories\xe2\x80\x94with annual limits on the number of visas that may be issued within each category.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Because the demand for visas outstrips supply, the wait for a visa can often last many years.  While a principal beneficiary waits, her place in line is determined based on her \xe2\x80\x9cpriority date,\xe2\x80\x9d the date on which her petition was filed.  See \xc2\xa71153(e)(1); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.1(b) (2014); 22 CFR \xc2\xa742.53(a) (2013).  Priority dates are therefore crucial\xe2\x80\x94the earlier one\xe2\x80\x99s priority date, the sooner one\xe2\x80\x99s place will come up in line and a visa will be available.  Significantly, when the wait ends and a principal beneficiary finally becomes eligible to apply for a visa,\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(d) enables the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s spouse and minor children (known as \xe2\x80\x9cderivative beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d) to do so too.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This case arises from a common problem: Given the lengthy period prospective immigrants must wait for a visa, a principal beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s child\xe2\x80\x94although younger than 21 when her parent\xe2\x80\x99s petition was initially filed\xe2\x80\x94often will have turned 21 by the time the parent\xe2\x80\x99s priority date comes up in line.  Such a child is said to have \xe2\x80\x9caged out\xe2\x80\x9d of derivative beneficiary treatment under \xc2\xa71153(d).  By way of example, respondent Norma Uy was the principal beneficiary of an F4 family-preference petition filed by her U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen sister in February 1981.  That petition listed Norma\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Ruth, who was then two years old, as a derivative beneficiary.  If Norma had reached the front of the visa line at any time before Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s 21st birthday, \xc2\xa71153(d) would have enabled Ruth to accompany Norma to the United States.  Unfortunately, it took more than two decades for Norma\xe2\x80\x99s priority date to become current, by which point Ruth was 23 and thus too old for derivative beneficiary status under \xc2\xa71153(d).  Norma therefore immigrated alone to the United States, where she filed a new F2B petition (for unmarried children of LPRs) on Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Before \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) was enacted, however, an immigrant in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s position would have been unable to retain the February 1981 priority date from her original petition; the law would have instead required her to receive a new priority date all the way at the back of the F2B line.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress responded to this problem by enacting \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), a provision entitled \xe2\x80\x9c[r]etention of priority date.\xe2\x80\x9d  It states: </p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9cIf the age of an alien is determined under [the formula specified in] paragraph (1)[[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]] to be 21 years of age or older for the purpos[e] of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [\xc2\xa71153(d)] of this section, the alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The provision\xe2\x80\x99s structure is crucial to its meaning.  The initial clause (call it the \xe2\x80\x9celigibility clause\xe2\x80\x9d) specifies who is eligible for relief.  The concluding clause (call it the \xe2\x80\x9crelief clause\xe2\x80\x9d) describes the two forms of relief to which eligible persons are entitled.  As the title of the provision suggests, the main form of relief is the right of an aged-out derivative beneficiary to retain the priority date of her original petition.  In Ruth Uy\xe2\x80\x99s case, such relief would mean the difference between resuming her wait near the front of the F2B line (which would allow her to receive a visa in short order) and being sent to the back of the line (where she would potentially have to wait an additional 27 years).  Brief for Respondents 52.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The question in this case is which aged-out beneficiaries of family-preference petitions are eligible for priority date retention: the aged-out beneficiaries of petitions in all five family-preference categories (which would include respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children, who were derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions for adult children and adult siblings of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens, respectively), or the aged-out beneficiaries of only F2A petitions for spouses and children of LPRs (the interpretation offered by the BIA)?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress answered that question in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause, which specifies that relief is to be conferred on any immigrant who has been \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined under [the formula specified in] paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of \xc2\xa71153(d).  As the plurality concedes, this clause \xe2\x80\x9cstates a condition that every aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, it makes eligible for relief aged-out children within each of the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories.  Ante, at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress made this clear in two mutually reinforc-ing ways.  First, by referring to the formula set forth in \xe2\x80\x9cparagraph (1),\xe2\x80\x9d the statute incorporates that paragraph\xe2\x80\x99s cross-reference to \xc2\xa71153(h)(2).  Section 1153(h)(2) in turn defines the set of covered petitions to include, \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary under [\xc2\xa71153(d)], a petition filed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for classificationof the alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent under [\xc2\xa71153(a)].\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa71153(a) encompasses all five family-preference categories.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  Second, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) promises relief to those who are found to be 21 \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpos[e] of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [\xc2\xa71153](d),\xe2\x80\x9d the provision governing derivative beneficiaries.  And that provision also unambiguously covers all five family-preference categories.  See \xc2\xa71153(d) (a minor child is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to the same status\xe2\x80\x9d as a parent who is the principal beneficiary of a petition filed under \xc2\xa71153(a)); \xc2\xa71153(a) (setting forth the five family-preferencecategories).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In short, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause answers the precise question in this case: Aged-out beneficiaries within all five categories are entitled to relief.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he intent of Congress is clear,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the end of the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 842.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because it concedes that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause unambiguously \xe2\x80\x9cencompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference petition,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 21, the plurality tries to fit this case into a special pocket of Chevron jurisprudence in which it says we must defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to ignore a clear statutory command due to a conflict between that command and another statutory provision.  See ante, at 14, 21.  Thus, unlike in the usual Chevron case, where ambiguity derives from the fact that the text does not speak with sufficient specificity to the question at issue, the plurality argues that this is a case in which ambiguity can only arise\xe2\x80\x94if it is to arise at all\xe2\x80\x94if Congress has spoken clearly on the issue in diametrically opposing ways.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  As the plurality frames it, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility and relief clauses are \xe2\x80\x9cJanus-faced,\xe2\x80\x9d and that conflict \xe2\x80\x9cmakes possible alternative reasonable constructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In rushing to find a conflict within the statute, the plurality neglects a fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation: We do not lightly presume that Congress has legislated in self-contradicting terms.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 180 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of a text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradic-tory.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [T]here can be no justification for needlessly ren-dering provisions in conflict if they can be interpreted harmoniously\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is especially true where, as here, the conflict that Congress supposedly created is not between two different statutes or even two separate provisions within a single statute, but between two clauses in the same sentence.  See ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is invariably true that intelligent drafters do not contradict themselves\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, time and again we have stressed our duty to \xe2\x80\x9cfit, if possible, all parts [of a statute] into [a] harmonious whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,\n389 (1959)\n; see also Morton v. Mancari,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535,\n551 (1974)\n (when two provisions \xe2\x80\x9care capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to regard each as effective\xe2\x80\x9d).  In reviewing an agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statute, courts \xe2\x80\x9cmust,\xe2\x80\x9d we have emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret the statute \xe2\x80\x98as a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. coherent regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than an internally inconsistent muddle, at war with itself and defective from the day it was written.  Brown &amp; Williamson, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 133.  And in doing so, courts should \xe2\x80\x9c[e]mplo[y] traditional tools of statutory construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421,\n446 (1987)\n.  Each of these cautions springs from a common well: As judicious as it can be to defer to administrative agencies, our foremost duty is, and always has been, to give effect to the law as drafted by Congress.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality contends that deference is appropriate here because, in its view,\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s two clauses are \xe2\x80\x9cself-contradictory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 33.  But far from it being unworkable (or even difficult) for the agency to obey both clauses, traditional tools of statutory construction reveal that \xc2\xa71153(h)\xe2\x80\x99s clauses are entirely compatible.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality argues that although \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause clearly encompasses aged-out beneficiaries within all five preference categories, the relief clause implies a conflicting \xe2\x80\x9climitation on the eligible class of recipients.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  The plurality infers that limitation from two premises.  First, it contends that no aged-out child may retain her priority date unless her petition is also eligible for automatic conversion.  And second, it asserts that only aged-out F2A beneficiaries may receive automatic conversion.  As a result, the plurality concludes, it was reasonable for the BIA to exclude aged-out children in the four other categories from receiving both automatic conversion and priority date retention, thereby rendering \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause defunct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is wrong because its premises are wrong.  For one, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) is naturally read to confer priority date retention as an independent form of relief to all aged-out children, regardless of whether automatic conversion is separately available.  And even if that were wrong, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s supposition that only F2A beneficiaries can receive automatic conversion is incorrect on its own terms.  Because either of these interpretations would treat \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) as a coherent whole, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s construction was impermissible. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The most obvious flaw in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is its presumption that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) permits an aged-out child to retain her original priority date only if her petition canbe automatically converted.  That is incorrect for many reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When an immigrant is determined to have aged out of derivative beneficiary status, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) prescribes two forms of relief: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have held that when a statute provides two forms of relief in this manner, joined by the conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d the two remedies are \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235\n\xe2\x80\x93242 (1989).  That understanding makes particular sense here, where Congress used the mandatory word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d twice, once before each form of relief.  See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26,\n35 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mandatory [term] \xe2\x80\x98shall\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the two \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d commands operate on different subjects, further reinforcing that they prescribe distinct remedies: An aged-out \xe2\x80\x9calien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x9d herself who, in all events, \xe2\x80\x9cshall retain\xe2\x80\x9d her original priority date.  \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality responds with a series of examples in which the word \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d is used to join two commands, one of which is\xe2\x80\x94as the plurality asserts here\xe2\x80\x94dependent on another.  Ante, at 28, and n. 15.  But as the plurality recognizes, ante, at 28, that is hardly the only way the word can be used.  For example: \xe2\x80\x9cIf today\xe2\x80\x99s baseball game is rained out, your ticket shall automatically be converted to a ticket for next Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, and you shall retain your free souvenir from today\xe2\x80\x99s game.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you provide the DMV with proof of your new address, your voter registration shall automatically be converted to the correct polling location, and you shall receive in the mail an updated driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is plain in both of these examples that the two commands are distinct\xe2\x80\x94the fan in the first example can keep her free souvenir even if she cannot attend next Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game; the new resident will receive an updated driver\xe2\x80\x99s license even if she is ineligible to vote.  What the plurality does not explain is why we should forgo the same understanding of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s relief clause when that would treat the statute as a coherent whole (and when the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s alternative interpretation would render the statute a walking self-contradiction within the span of a few words).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With the text unavailing, the plurality turns to a policy argument.  The plurality worries that if automatic conversion and priority date retention are independent benefits, aged-out beneficiaries will be able to \xe2\x80\x9chold on to a priority date for years .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. while waiting for a relative to file a new petition,\xe2\x80\x9d which might hamper U.\xc2\xa0S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) operations.  Ante, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  But the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s fears of administrative inconvenience are belied by the fact that USCIS has administered prior-ity date retention in exactly this manner for years, with no apparent problems.  Well before \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) was enacted, a regulation provided aged-out F2A derivative beneficiaries the ability to retain their priority dates without also providing automatic conversion.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(a)(4) (permitting priority date retention after a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate petition\xe2\x80\x9d is filed); 57 Fed. Reg. 41053, 41059 (1992) (adopting this provision).  Indeed, the USCIS continues to instruct field officers that a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate petition\xe2\x80\x9d must be filed in order for such beneficiaries to \xe2\x80\x9cretain\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9coriginal priority date[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Adjudicator\xe2\x80\x99s Field Manual, ch.\xc2\xa021.2(c)(5), online at http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1.html (all Internet materials as visited June 5, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The notion that it is somehow impossible for an immigrant to retain her priority date contingent upon the filing of a separate petition is therefore contradicted by years of agency experience.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the end, the plurality suggests that we should defer to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s all-or-nothing approach because \xe2\x80\x9ccontext compels\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Ante, at 28.  Yet fatally absent from the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of context is any mention of the first clause of the very same provision, which, as the plurality admits, unambiguously confers relief upon all five categories of aged-out children.  That clause is dispositive, because\xe2\x80\x94assuming that F2A beneficiaries alone can receive automatic conversion\xe2\x80\x94a reading that treats automatic conversion and priority date retention as independent benefits is the only one that would \xe2\x80\x9cproduc[e] a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  United Sav.

See Burrage v.

The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cconvert\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cto change (something) into a different form.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 444.  Here, the statute specifies the form into which an aged-out child\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall be changed: another petition in the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  Tying the terms together, then, \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d means changing an old petition into a new petition in an appropriate category upon the occurrenceof some predicate event, without a further decision or contingency.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        All aged-out beneficiaries can have their petitions automatically converted under this definition.  Perhaps most sensibly, all five categories of petitions may be converted to an appropriate category, without any further decision or contingency, upon a logical predicate event: when USCIS receives confirmation that an appropriate category exists.  To see how this would work, recall the case of Norma Uy, and her daughter, Ruth.  Norma was the principal beneficiary of an F4 petition filed by her U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen sister; Ruth was a derivative beneficiary of the same petition.  Because Ruth had aged out of derivative beneficiary status prior to Norma\xe2\x80\x99s reaching the front of the visa line, Norma immigrated to the United States without Ruth.  Once Norma became an LPR, however, she also became eligible to file a new petition on Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s behalf underthe F2B category (unmarried adult children of LPRs), \xc2\xa71153(a)(2)(B).  Thus, once Norma provides confirmation of that eligibility to sponsor Ruth (i.e., that she is an LPR, that Ruth is her daughter, and that she has not committed disqualifying criminal conduct, see ante, at 4), Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s original F4 petition can automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, this is how USCIS already applies automatic conversion in other contexts.  For example, when an LPR has filed an F2A petition on behalf of a spouse or child, and the LPR subsequently becomes a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen, a provision entitled \xe2\x80\x9c[a]utomatic conversion of preference classification,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i), permits the F2A petition to be automatically converted to an \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate relative\xe2\x80\x9d petition, \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(3).  See ante, at 16.  Significantly, the predicate event that triggers this conversion is the agency\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of proof that the petition\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor has become a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen\xe2\x80\x94proof, in other words, that there is an appropriate category into which the petition can be converted.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Section 1153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s automatic conversion remedy can sensibly be administered in the same way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion that automatic conversion is impossible for all but one category of family-preference petitions hinges on three basic misunderstandings.  First, the plurality contends that automatic conversion is triggered not by confirmation of the existence of an appropriate category, but rather by a different predicate event: the moment when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an immigrant visa number bec[omes] available for the alien\xe2\x80\x99s parent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.  This is a curious argument, not least because nothing in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) suggests it.  That provision simply makes automatic conversion available \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the age of an alien is determined\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cbe 21 years of age or older\xe2\x80\x9d for pur-poses of \xc2\xa71153(d).  Section 1153(h)(3) thus states the condition that an immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for automatic conversion, but it nowhere commands when the conversion should occur.  There is no reason why conversion cannot occur at the logical point just described: the moment when USCIS receives proof that an appropriate category exists.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality acknowledges that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not explicitly identify th[e] point in time\xe2\x80\x9d at which a \xe2\x80\x9cpetition is to be \xe2\x80\x98converted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  It nevertheless suggests that the date when a conversion occurs \xe2\x80\x9cis best viewed\xe2\x80\x9d as the date when a visa became available for the aged-out child\xe2\x80\x99s parent.  Ante, at 19.  But Congress could not have intended conversion to occur at that point for a glaring reason: The date on which a visa becomes available for an aged-out child\xe2\x80\x99s parent occurs before the point at which the child is determined to have aged-out under \xc2\xa71153(d)\xe2\x80\x94the very requirement \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) prescribes for the aged-out child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first place.  As the plurality explains, ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, such age determinations occur when an immigration official reviews the child\xe2\x80\x99s derivative visa application, which invariably happens after a visa became available for the child\xe2\x80\x99s parent as the principal beneficiary.  At best, then, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation requires USCIS to convert petitions at a time when it does not know which petitions are eligible for conversion; at worst, it requires the automatic conversion of petitions benefiting immigrants who will never even qualify for such relief (i.e., aged-out immigrants who, for any number of reasons, never file a visa application and so are never determined by officials to be older than 21).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Faced with this fact, the plurality falls back to the position that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as having occurred \xe2\x80\x9cas of th[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. date\xe2\x80\x9d when a parent\xe2\x80\x99s visa becomes available, although the actual \xe2\x80\x9cassess[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of the conversion will necessarily occur at some future point in time.  Ante, at 24, n. 13.  That approach, however, introduces precisely the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional decisions, contingencies, and delays\xe2\x80\x9d that the plurality regards as inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15.  For even under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, automatic conversion cannot actually be \xe2\x80\x9cassesse[d]\xe2\x80\x9d until and unless the aged-out child decides to apply for a visa and officials assessing the child\xe2\x80\x99s application deem her to have aged out (events which may themselves be contingent on the child\xe2\x80\x99s parent first filing her own successful visa application, see ante, at 6).  The far simpler approach is for conversion to occur automatically upon the most logical moment suggested by the statute: the moment when USCIS confirms that an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category\xe2\x80\x9d exists, \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  Indeed, the plurality fails to explain why this cannot be the proper predicate; it simply dismisses such an approach as supported \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9ca single-minded resolve .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 25, n. 13.  But that criticism is revealing: The \xe2\x80\x9csingle-minded resolve\xe2\x80\x9d the plurality maligns is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 own, for it is Congress that expressly provided, in the eligibility clause, for aged-out beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s second argument is a corollary of its first.  If automatic conversion must occur when a visa first becomes available for a parent, the plurality frets, that will mean an aged-out child will have her petition automatically converted before immigration officials can ascertain whether her parent is even qualified to sponsor her.  See ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  True enough, but that only confirms that it makes no sense to force USCIS to convert petitions so prematurely.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s fears can all be averted by having automatic conversion occur, as with petitions sponsored by LPRs who later become U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens, supra, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315, when USCIS receives confirmation that conversion is appropriate.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s final argument is that something about the term \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d precludes relief for all but the aged-out derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions.  The plurality accepts that \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d will always require changing some aspects of a petition, including its preference category (e.g., from F2A to F2B) and the identity of its principal beneficiary (e.g., from an aged-out child\xe2\x80\x99s parent to the child).  But the plurality asserts that a related kind of change is entirely off the table: a change to the identity of the petition\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor.  Ante, at 15.  If a converted petition requires a different sponsor than the original petition, the plurality suggests, then it cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cconverted\xe2\x80\x9d at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d that supports this distinction.  It instead argues that a \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d cannot entail a change to the identity of a petition\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor because that is \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive way immigration law used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16.  But immigration law has long allowed petitions to be converted from one category to another in contexts where doing so requires changing the sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  In 2006, for example, the Secretary of Homeland Security promulgated a regulatory provision entitled \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion of preference classification,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 CFR \xc2\xa7204.2(i)(1)(iv), which allows the automatic conversion of a petition filed by a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen on behalf of her spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before the petition is approved.  That conversion requires changing the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself.  The fact that the agency used the word \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a process in which the petition\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor was changed, just a few years after\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) was enacted, strongly suggests that the term did not have the exclusive meaning that the plurality suggests.  Similarly, \xc2\xa71154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III), a provision enacted two years before \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), see Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000,\n\n114Stat.\n1522, provides that a petition filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child \xe2\x80\x9cshall be considered\xe2\x80\x9d a self-petition filed by the child herself if the child ages out\xe2\x80\x94a conversion that obviously requires changing the identity of the sponsor from the battered spouse to the aged-out child.  And \xc2\xa71153(h)(4) confirms that such \xe2\x80\x9cself-petitioners\xe2\x80\x9d are entitled to \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s automatic conversion remedy.  The plurality never explains how it can be mandatory to \xe2\x80\x9cconvert\xe2\x80\x9d the identity of the sponsors in these contexts yet impermissible to \xe2\x80\x9cconvert\xe2\x80\x9d the sponsors of the petitions at issue here\xe2\x80\x94an understanding that is especially implausible in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 command that such petitions \xe2\x80\x9cshall automatically be converted to the appropriate category.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The concurrence reaches the same result as the plural-ity does, but for a different reason.  It begins by recognizing that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility clause \xe2\x80\x9cstates a condition\xe2\x80\x9d that is satisfied by aged-out \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficiaries from any preference category.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  The concurrence thus acknowledges that the eligibility clause encompasses aged-out beneficiaries of family-preference petitions in the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The concurrence nonetheless concludes that the BIA was free to exclude F1, F2B, F3, and F4 beneficiaries from the clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a perceived ambiguity as to which beneficiaries can receive \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not speak clearly to which petitions can \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98automatically be converted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, the concurrence concludes that it was reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear text of the eligibility clause because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic conversion\xe2\x80\x9d might be read in a manner that would benefit F2A beneficiaries alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This is an unusual way to interpret a statute.  The concurrence identifies no case in which we have deferred to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a statute as a license to ignore another statutory provision that is perfectly clear.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  United Sav. Assn. of Tex., 484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 371.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The concurrence justifies its conclusion only by treating the eligibility clause as a nullity.  The concurrence is quite candid about its approach, arguing that \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s relief clause is its \xe2\x80\x9conly operative provision\xe2\x80\x9d  and that the eligibility clause does not \xe2\x80\x9cgrant anything to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3.  Yet \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is our duty \xe2\x80\x98to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Menasche,\n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528\n\xe2\x80\x93539 (1955).  And there is an easy way to give meaning to the eligibility clause: The clause identifies who is entitled to the benefits specified in the ensuing relief clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The concurrence relies ultimately on an irrelevant hypothetical: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a student is determined to be enrolled at an accredited university, the student\xe2\x80\x99s cost of off-campus housing shall be deductible on her tax return.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3.  In this example, the concurrence points out, it is \xe2\x80\x9capparent.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even though the student falls within the conditional first clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That is correct, but it says nothing about this case.  For in the hypothetical, it is plain that the promised relief (a tax deduction for off-campus housing) cannot apply to the persons at issue (students who live on campus).  Here, however, the relief promised in \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) (priority date retention and automatic conversion) can be given to persons specified inthe initial eligibility clause (aged-out children in all five family-preference categories).  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9319.  And once one recognizes that aged-out children in each cate-gory unambiguously covered by the eligibility clause can receive relief, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s view that no children in four of those categories can ever receive any relief cannot be reasonable.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress faced a difficult choice when it enacted \xc2\xa71153(h)(3).  Given the \xe2\x80\x9czero-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 33, Congress could have required aged-out children like Ruth Uy to lose their place in line and wait many additional years (or even decades) before being reunited with their parents, or it could have enabled such immigrants to retain their place in line\xe2\x80\x94albeit at the cost of extending the wait for other immigrants by some shorter amount.  Whatever one might think of the policy arguments on each side, however, this much is clear: Congress made a choice.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view\xe2\x80\x94that Congress actually delegated the choice to the BIA in a statute that unambiguously encompasses aged-out children in all five preference categories and commands that they \xe2\x80\x9cshall retain the[ir] original priority date[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71153(h)(3)\xe2\x80\x94is untenable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the end, then, this case should have been resolved under a commonsense approach to statutory interpretation: Using traditional tools of statutory construction, agencies and courts should try to give effect to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear text before concluding that Congress has legislated in conflicting and unintelligible terms.  Here, there are straightforward interpretations of \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) that allow it to function as a coherent whole.  Because the BIA and the Court ignore these interpretations and advance a construction that contravenes the language Congress wrote, I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The five categories are F1 (unmarried adult children of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens); F2A (spouses and unmarried minor children of LPRs); F2B (unmarried adult children of LPRs); F3 (married children of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens); and F4 (brothers and sisters of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens).  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0As the plurality explains, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the formula specified in paragraph (1) subtracts out bureaucratic delays resulting from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s review of the relevant immigration paperwork.

Yet the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach does the same thing, because even on its account, some \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions, contingencies, or delays\xe2\x80\x9d must occur before conversion can actually be assessed by immigration officials ( a parent\xe2\x80\x99s visa must become available, the child must apply for a visa, and immigration officials must deem her to have aged out, see , at 16).

The former understanding would allow the unambiguous language of the eligibility clause to be carried into effect; the latter would preclude relief for four categories of derivative beneficiaries.

I also agree with The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s critique of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that, when two halves of a statute \xe2\x80\x9cdo not easily cohere with each other,\xe2\x80\x9d an agency administering the statute is free to decide which half it will obey.  Ante, at 14.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]irect conflict is not ambiguity, and the resolution of such conflict is not statutory construction but legislative choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  While I, like Justice Sotomayor, would affirm the Court of Appeals, my justification for doing so differs somewhat from hers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As I see it, the question before us is whether there is or is not an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate category\xe2\x80\x9d to which the petitions for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children may be converted.  If there is, the agency was obligated by the clear text of\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71153(h)(3) to convert the petitions and leave the children with their original priority dates.  Any such conversion would be \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic,\xe2\x80\x9d because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to convert the petitions follows inexorably, and without need for any additional action on the part of either respondents or their children, from the fact that the children\xe2\x80\x99s ages have been calculated to be 21 or older.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  If there is not an appropriate category, then the agency was not required to convert the petitions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        By the time respondents became legal permanent residents and filed new petitions for their children (if not sooner), there existed an appropriate category to which the original petitions could be converted.  That is because at that point the children all qualified for F2B preference status, as unmarried, adult children of legal permanent residents.  Accordingly, the agency should have converted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children\xe2\x80\x99s petitions and allowed them to retain their original priority dates.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1153(h)(3) is brief and cryptic.  It may well contain a great deal of ambiguity, which the Board of Immigration Appeals in its expertise is free to resolve, so long as its resolution is a \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837,\n843 (1984)\n.  But the statute is clear on at least one point: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the age of an alien is determined under [\xc2\xa71153(h)(1)] to be 21 years of age or older .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , the alien\xe2\x80\x99s petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  The Board was not free to disregard this clear statutory command.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0I do not believe the term \xe2\x80\x9cconverted\xe2\x80\x9d demands the interpretationthe plurality gives it, for the reasons advanced in \xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Government does not argue that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 children were ineligible for relief because, as a factual matter, their ages were never \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be 21 years of age or older,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71153(h)(3), after an appropriate category became available.
