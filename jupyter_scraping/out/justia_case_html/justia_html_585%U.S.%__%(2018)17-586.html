To do so, Texas had to comply with a complicated legal regime.  The Equal Protection Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment forbids \xe2\x80\x9cracial gerrymandering,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, intentionally assigning citizens to a district on the basis of race without sufficient justification.  <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, 641.  But other legal requirements tend to require that state legislatures consider race in drawing districts.  Like all States, Texas is subject to \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which is violated when a state districting plan provides \xe2\x80\x9cless opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d for racial minorities \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of their choice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399, 425.  And at the time, Texas was also subject to \xc2\xa75, which barred it from making any districting changes unless it could prove that they did not result in retrogression with respect to the ability of racial minorities to elect the candidates of their choice, <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  In an effort to harmonize these conflicting demands, the Court has assumed that compliance with the VRA is a compelling State interest for\n \nFourteenth Amendment purposes, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bethune-Hill</i> v. <i>Virginia State Bd. of Elections</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___; and a State\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in making a districting decision is narrowly tailored if the State has \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for believing that its decision is necessary in order to comply with the VRA, <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Texas Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 plans were immediately tied up in litigation and never used.  The case was assigned to a three-judge court (Texas court).  Texas also submitted the plans for preclearance to the District Court for the District of Columbia (D.\xc2\xa0C. court).  The Texas court drew up interim plans for the State\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly approaching primaries, giving no deference to the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s plans.  Texas challenged the court-ordered plans in this Court, which reversed and remanded with instructions for the Texas court to start with the Texas Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 plans but to make adjustments as required by the Constitution and the VRA.  The Texas court then adopted new interim plans.  After the D. C. court denied preclearance of the 2011 plans, Texas used the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans for the 2012 elections.  In 2013, the Legislature repealed the 2011 plans and enacted the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s plans (with minor modifications).  After <i>Shelby County</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 529, was decided, Texas, no longer covered by \xc2\xa75, obtained a vacatur of the D.\xc2\xa0C. court\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance order.  But the Texas court did not dismiss the case against the 2011 plans as moot.  Instead, it allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to challenge the 2013 plans and held that their challenges to the 2011 plans were live.  Texas conducted its 2014 and 2016 elections under the 2013 plans.  In 2017, the Texas court found defects in several of the districts in the 2011 federal congressional and State House plans (the State Senate plan is not at issue here).  Subsequently, it also invalidated multiple Congressional (CD) and House (HD) Districts in the 2013 plans, holding that the Legislature failed to cure the \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d of discriminatory intent allegedly harbored by the 2011 Legislature.  And the court relied on that finding to invalidate several challenged 2013 districts.  The court also held that three districts\xe2\x80\x94CD27, HD32, and HD34\xe2\x80\x94were invalid under \xc2\xa72 of the VRA because they had the <i>effect</i> of depriving Latinos of the equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice.  And it found that HD90 was a racial gerrymander based on changes made by the 2013 Legislature.  It gave the state attorney general three days to tell the court whether the Legislature would remedy the violations; and if the Legislature did not intend to adopt new plans, the court would hold remedial hearings.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction to review the orders at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s orders fall within\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253, which gives the Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order of a three-judge district court \xe2\x80\x9cgranting or denying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Texas court did not <i>call</i> its orders \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctions,\xe2\x80\x9d but where an order has the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of granting or denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.  <i>Carson</i> v. <i>American Brands, Inc.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79, 83.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The text of the orders and the context in which they were issued make clear that they qualify as interlocutory injunctions under \xc2\xa71253.  The orders were unequivocal that the current legislative plans \xe2\x80\x9cviolate \xc2\xa72 and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d and that these violations \xe2\x80\x9cmust be remedied.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the short time frame the attorney general was given to act is strong evidence that the court did not intend to allow the elections to go ahead under the plans it had just condemned.  The unmistakable import of these actions is that the court intended to have new plans ready for use in this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections.  Texas also had reason to fear that if it tried to conduct elections under those plans, the court would infer an evil motive and perhaps subject the State to the strictures of preclearance under \xc2\xa73(c) of the VRA.  These cases differ from <i>Gunn</i> v. <i>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam</i>,\n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, where the order did not have the same practical effect as an injunction.  Nor does it matter that the remedy is not yet known.  The issue here is whether this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections can be held under the plans enacted by the Legislature, not whether any particular remedies should ultimately be ordered if it is determined that the current plans are flawed.  Section 1253 must be strictly, but sensibly construed, and here the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders, for all intents and purposes, constituted injunctions.  Thus, \xc2\xa71253 provides jurisdiction.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Texas court erred in requiring the State to show that the 2013 Legislature purged the \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d that the court attributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior legislature in 2011.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State.  <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Bossier Parish School Bd.</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 481.  In redistricting cases, the \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900, 915.  The allocation of the burden of proof and the presumption of legislative good faith are not changed by a finding of past discrimination, which is but \xe2\x80\x9cone evidentiary source\xe2\x80\x9d relevant to the question of intent.  <i>Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252, 267.  Here, the 2011 plans were repealed, and not reenacted, by the 2013 Legislature.  Nor did it use criteria that arguably carried forward the effects of the 2011 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory intent.  Instead, it enacted, with only small changes, the Texas court plans developed pursuant to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.  The Texas court contravened these basic burden of proof principles, referring, <i>e.g.,</i> to the need to \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d the earlier Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d and concluding that the Legislature had engaged in no deliberative process to do so.  This fundamentally flawed approach must be reversed.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9325. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Both the 2011 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent and the court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans are relevant to the extent that they give rise to\xe2\x80\x94or tend to refute\xe2\x80\x94inferences about the 2013 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent, but they must be weighed together with other relevant direct and circumstantial evidence of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  But when this evidence is taken into account, the evidence in the record is plainly insufficient to prove that the 2013 Legislature acted in bad faith and engaged in intentional discrimination.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">3.\xc2\xa0Once the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s intent finding is reversed, there remain only four districts that were invalidated on alternative grounds.  The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s holding as to the three districts in which it relied on \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d test are reversed, but its holding that HD90 is a racial gerrymander is affirmed.  Pp.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9341.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0To make out a \xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d claim, a plaintiff must establish the three \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Gingles</i> factors\xe2\x80\x9d: (1) a geographically compact minority population sufficient to constitute a majority in a single-member district, (2) political cohesion among the members of the minority group, and (3) bloc voting by the majority to defeat the minority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate.  <i>Thornburg</i> v. <i>Gingles</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30, 48\xe2\x80\x9351.  A plaintiff who makes that showing must then prove that, under the totality of the circumstances, the district lines dilute the votes of the members of the minority group.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The Texas court held that CD27 violates \xc2\xa72 because it has the effect of diluting the votes of Nueces County Latino voters, who, the court concluded, should have been included in a Latino opportunity district rather than CD27, which is not such a district.  Plaintiffs, however, could not show that an additional Latino opportunity district could be created in that part of Texas.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Texas court similarly erred in holding that HD32 and HD34, which make up the entirety of Nueces County, violate \xc2\xa72.  The 2013 plan created two districts that lie wholly within the county: HD34 is a Latino opportunity district, but HD32 is not.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s findings show that these two districts do not violate \xc2\xa72, and it is hard to see how the ultimate <i>Gingles</i> vote dilution standard could be met if the alternative plan would not enhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of their choice.  Pp.\xc2\xa035\xe2\x80\x9338. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0HD90 is an impermissible racial gerrymander.  HD90 was not copied from the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans.  Instead, the 2013 legislature substantially modified that district.  In 2011, the Legislature, responding to pressure from counsel to one of the plaintiff groups, increased the district\xe2\x80\x99s Latino population in an effort to make it a Latino opportunity district.  It also moved the city of Como, which is predominantly African-American, out of the district.  When Como residents and their Texas House representative objected, the Legislature moved Como back.  But that decreased the Latino population, so the Legislature moved more Latinos into the district.  Texas argues that its use of race as the predominant factor in HD90\xe2\x80\x99s design was permissible because it had \xe2\x80\x9c<i>good reasons</i> to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that this was necessary to satisfy \xc2\xa72, <i>Bethune-Hill</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  But it is the State\xe2\x80\x99s burden to prove narrow tailoring, and Texas did not do so on the record here.

The court developed those plans for use in the 2012 elections pursuant to our directions in <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Perez</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388 (2012) (<i>per curiam</i>).  We instructed the three-judge court to start with the plans adopted by the Texas Legislature in 2011 but to make adjustments as required by the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.  <i>Id.</i>, at 392\xe2\x80\x93396.  After those plans were used in 2012, the Texas Legislature enacted them (with only minor modifications) in 2013, and the plans were used again in both 2014 and 2016.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Last year, however, the three-judge court reversed its prior analysis and held that some of the districts in those plans are unlawful.  After reviewing the repealed 2011 plans, which had never been used, the court found that they were tainted by discriminatory intent and that the 2013 Legislature had not \xe2\x80\x9ccured\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ctaint.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We now hold that the three-judge court committed a fundamental legal error.  It was the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 burden to show that the 2013 Legislature acted with discriminatory intent when it enacted plans that the court itself had produced.  The 2013 Legislature was not obligated to show that it had \xe2\x80\x9ccured\xe2\x80\x9d the unlawful intent that the court attributed to the 2011 Legislature.  Thus, the essential pillar of the three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was critically flawed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the congressional and state legislative districts are reviewed under the proper legal standards, all but one of them, we conclude, are lawful.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The 2010 decennial census revealed that the population of Texas had grown by more than 20% and the State was therefore apportioned four additional seats in the United States House of Representatives.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 369a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  To accommodate this new allocation and the population changes shown by the census, the Legislature adopted a new congressional districting plan, as well as new districting maps for the two houses of the State Legislature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Redistricting is never easy, and the task was especially complicated in Texas in 2011.  Not only was the Legislature required to draw districts that were substantially equal in population, see <i>Perry</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 391\xe2\x80\x93392; <i>Rey- nolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533 (1964); <i>Wesberry</i> v. <i>Sanders</i>,\n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1964), and to comply with special state-law districting rules,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] but federal law imposed complex and delicately balanced requirements regarding the consideration of race.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Then, as now, federal law restricted the use of race in making districting decisions.  The Equal Protection Clause forbids \xe2\x80\x9cracial gerrymandering,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, intentionally assigning citizens to a district on the basis of race without sufficient justification.  <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, 641 (1993).  It also prohibits intentional \xe2\x80\x9cvote dilution\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinvidiously .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. minimiz[ing] or cancel[ing] out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mobile </i>v.<i> Bolden</i>,\n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55, 66\xe2\x80\x9367 (1980) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the Equal Protection Clause imposes these important restrictions, its application in the field of districting is complicated.  For one thing, because a voter\xe2\x80\x99s race sometimes correlates closely with political party preference, see <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2017) (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320); <i>Easley</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, 243 (2001), it may be very difficult for a court to determine whether a districting decision was based on race or party preference.  Here, the three-judge court found that the two factors were virtually indistinguishable.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time that the Equal Protection Clause restricts the consideration of race in the districting process, compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\n79Stat.\n437, as amended,\n\n52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710301 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i> (VRA), pulls in the opposite direction: It often insists that districts be created precisely because of race.  Two provisions of the VRA exert such demands, and in 2011, Texas was subject to both.  At that time, Texas was covered by \xc2\xa75 of the VRA[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] and was thus barred from making any districting changes unless it could prove that they did not result in \xe2\x80\x9cretrogression\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the ability of racial minorities to elect the candidates of their choice.  <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3).  That showing obviously demanded consideration of race.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On top of this, Texas was (and still is) required to comply with \xc2\xa72 of the VRA.

In a series of cases tracing back to <i>Thornburg</i> v. <i>Gingles</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30 (1986), we have interpreted this standard to mean that, under certain circumstance, States must draw \xe2\x80\x9copportunity\xe2\x80\x9d districts in which minority groups form \xe2\x80\x9ceffective majorit[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>LULAC</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 426.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since the Equal Protection Clause restricts consideration of race and the VRA demands consideration of race, a legislature attempting to produce a lawful districting plan is vulnerable to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98competing hazards of liability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 952, 977 (1996) (plurality opinion).  In an effort to harmonize these conflicting demands, we have assumed that compliance with the VRA may justify the consideration of race in a way that would not otherwise be allowed.  In technical terms, we have assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling state interest, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bethune-Hill</i> v. <i>Virginia State Bd. of Elections</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 13); <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Hunt</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899, 915 (1996), and that a State\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in making a districting decision is narrowly tailored and thus satisfies strict scrutiny if the State has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98good reasons\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for believing that its decision is necessary in order to comply with the VRA.  <i>Cooper</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Facing this legal obstacle course, the Texas Legislature in 2011 adopted new districting plans, but those plans were immediately tied up in litigation and were never used.  Several plaintiff groups quickly filed challenges in the District Court for the Western District of Texas, arguing that some of the districts in the new plans were racial gerrymanders, some were based on intentional vote dilution, and some had the effect of depriving minorities of the equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice.  This case was assigned to a three-judge court, as required by\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a).

To do this, Texas filed for a declaratory judgment in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  See <i>Texas </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 887 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 133 (2012).  (We will call this court \xe2\x80\x9cthe D. C. court.\xe2\x80\x9d)  By early 2012, the D. C. court had not yet issued a decision, and Texas needed usable plans for its rapidly approaching primaries.  Accordingly, the Texas court drew up interim plans for that purpose.  <i>Perez</i> v. <i>Perry</i>, 835 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 209 (2011).  In creating those plans, the majority of the Texas court thought that it was not \xe2\x80\x9crequired to give any deference to the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s enacted plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 213.

At the same time, Texas filed an appeal in this Court contesting the decision of the D. C. court,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>] but that appeal ultimately died for two reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the 2011 plans were repealed.  The Texas attorney general urged the Legislature to pass new redistricting plans, C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 429a, and in his view, the \xe2\x80\x9cbest way to remedy the violations found by the D.

One of the legislative sponsors, Senator Seliger, explained that, although \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Texas Legislature remains confident that the legislatively-drawn maps adopted in 2011 are fair and legal .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , there remain several outstanding legal questions regarding these maps that undermine the stability and predictability of the electoral process in Texas.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 624, 649, n.\xc2\xa040 (2017).

The 2013 Legislature then repealed the 2011 plans and enacted the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans with just a few minor changes.

In September 2013, the Texas court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaints to challenge the 2013 plans, but the court held that their challenges to the 2011 plans were still alive, reasoning that the repeal of the 2011 plans represented the \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary cessation\xe2\x80\x9d of allegedly unconstitutional conduct.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Texas conducted its 2014 and 2016 elections under the plans that had been preliminarily approved by the Texas court and subsequently adopted (with only minor changes) by the Legislature in 2013.  But in March and April 2017, after multiple trials, the Texas court issued a pair of rulings on the defunct 2011 plans.  The court reaffirmed the conclusions it had reached in 2012 about defects in the 2011 plans, and it went further.  Contrary to its earlier decision, it held that Congressional District (CD) 35 is an impermissible racial gerrymander and that CD27 violates \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act because it has the effect of diluting the electoral opportunities of Latino voters.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 181a, 193a\xe2\x80\x93194a.  Previously, the court had provided detailed reasons for rejecting the very arguments that it now accepted.  <i>Id.</i>, at 409a\xe2\x80\x93423a.  Similarly, the court held that multiple districts in the plan for the Texas House were the result of intentional vote dilution.  These included districts in the counties of Nueces (House District (HD) 32, HD34), Bell (HD54, HD55), and Dallas (HD103, HD104, HD105).

The court invalidated the districts in those plans that correspond to districts in the 2011 plan that it had just held to be unlawful, <i>i.e.</i>, CD27, CD35, HD32, HD34, HD54, HD55, HD103, HD104, and HD105.

And it faulted the State because it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not accept [findings of the D.\xc2\xa0C. court] and instead appealed to the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Seeing no evidence that the State had undergone \xe2\x80\x9ca change of heart,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to adopt the [District Court\xe2\x80\x99s] plans\xe2\x80\x9d was a \xe2\x80\x9clitigation strategy designed to insulate the 2011 or 2013 plans from further challenge, regardless of their legal infirmities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 649\xe2\x80\x93650.  Finally, summarizing its analysis, the court reiterated that the 2011 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory taint was not removed by the [2013] Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 686.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions about CD35 and all but three of the Texas House districts were based entirely on its finding that the 2013 Legislature had not purged its predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory intent.  However, the court also held that three districts\xe2\x80\x94CD27, HD32, and HD34\xe2\x80\x94were invalid under \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act because they had the effect of depriving Latinos of the equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice.  <i>Id.</i>, at 682\xe2\x80\x93686; 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 775\xe2\x80\x93783.

Mindful that October 1 was the deadline for the Texas Secretary of State to provide voter registration templates to the State\xe2\x80\x99s counties, App. 380a\xe2\x80\x93381a, the court took steps to bring about prompt remedial action.  In two orders issued on August 15 and 24, the Texas attorney general was instructed to advise the court, within three days, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Legislature intends to take up redistricting in an effort to cure these violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686; 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795.  If the Legislature chose not to do so, the court warned, it would \xe2\x80\x9chold a hearing to consider remedial plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  After the Governor made clear that the State would not act, the court ordered the parties to proceed with a hearing on the congressional plan on September 5, as well as a hearing on the plan for the Texas House on September 6.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686; 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795; App. 134a\xe2\x80\x93136a; Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Opposed Motion To Stay Order on Plan C235 Pending Appeal or Final Judgment in Civ.

Appellants claim that the orders amount to injunctions and are therefore appealable to this Court under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.  Appellees disagree, contending that the orders do not qualify as injunctions.  We hold that we have jurisdiction because the orders were effectively injunctions in that they barred Texas from using the districting plans now in effect to conduct this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Judiciary Act of 1789,\n\n1Stat.\n73, \xe2\x80\x9cestablished the general principle that only final decisions of the federal district courts would be reviewable on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carson</i> v. <i>American Brands, Inc.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79, 83 (1981) (emphasis deleted).  But because \xe2\x80\x9crigid application of this principle was found to create undue hardship in some cases,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress created exceptions.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Two are relevant here.  We have jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253 to hear an appeal from an order of a three-judge district court \xe2\x80\x9cgranting or denying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexcept where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The orders in these cases fall within \xc2\xa71253.  To be sure, the District Court did not <i>call</i> its orders \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it disclaimed the term, App. 134a\xe2\x80\x93136a\xe2\x80\x94but the label attached to an order is not dispositive.  We have previously made clear that where an order has the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of granting or denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.  <i>Carson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 83; see also <i>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</i> v. <i>Mayacamas Corp.</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 271, 287\xe2\x80\x93288 (1988).  We applied this test in <i>Carson</i>, holding that an order that declined to enter a consent decree prohibiting certain conduct could be appealed under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) because it was the practical equivalent of an order denying an injunction and threatened serious and perhaps irreparable harm if not immediately reviewed.  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83\xe2\x80\x9384, 86\xe2\x80\x9390.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule serves a valuable purpose.  If an interlocutory injunction is improperly granted or denied, much harm can occur before the final decision in the district court.  Lawful and important conduct may be barred, and unlawful and harmful conduct may be allowed to continue.  Recognizing this, Congress authorized interlocutory appellate review of such orders.  But if the availability of interlocutory review depended on the district court\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction\xe2\x80\x9d or some other particular language, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s scheme could be frustrated.  The harms that Congress wanted to avoid could occur so long as the district court was careful about its terminology.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry prevents such manipulation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In analogous contexts, we have not allowed district courts to \xe2\x80\x9cshield [their] orders from appellate review\xe2\x80\x9d by avoiding the label \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sampson</i> v. <i>Murray</i>,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61, 87 (1974).  For instance, in <i>Sampson</i>, we held that an order labeled a temporary restraining order (which is not appealable under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1)) should be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary injunction\xe2\x80\x9d (which is appealable) since the order had the same practical effect as a preliminary injunction.  <i>Id.</i>, at 86\xe2\x80\x9388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Appellees and the dissent contend that the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d approach should be confined to \xc2\xa71292(a)(1), but we see no good reason why it should not apply to \xc2\xa71253 as well.  Appellees note that we \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly constru[e]\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71253, <i>Goldstein</i> v. <i>Cox</i>,\n\n396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 478 (1970), but we also construe \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Carson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 84.  In addition, the relevant language in the two provisions is nearly identical;[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>] both provisions serve the same purpose; and we have previously called them \xe2\x80\x9canalogous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Goldstein</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 475.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The provisions are also textually interlocked.  Section 1292(a)(1) does not apply where \xe2\x80\x9cdirect review may be had in the Supreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, where \xc2\xa71253 applies.  If the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effects\xe2\x80\x9d test applied under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) but not \xc2\xa71253, the consequences would be unfortunate and strange.  We would have to identify the magic language needed for an order to qualify as an order granting or denying an injunction, and that standard would hardly constitute the sort of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]imple\xe2\x80\x9d rule that the dissent prizes.  See <i>post</i>, at 14 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  Then, having developed that standard, we would have to apply it in any case in which a party took an appeal to us from an order of a three-judge court that clearly had the practical effect of an injunction.  If we concluded that the magic-words test was not met, the order would appear to be appealable to one of the courts of appeals under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1).  In the language of that provision, the order would be an \xe2\x80\x9corde[r] of [a] district cour[t] of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. granting [an] injunctio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  And because this Court would lack jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253, the appeal would not fall within \xc2\xa71292(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exception for cases \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Having taken pains to provide for review in this Court, and not in the courts of appeals, of three-judge court orders granting injunctions Congress surely did not intend to produce that result.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Appellees argue that an order denying an injunction (the situation in <i>Carson</i>) and an order granting an injunction (the situation here) should be treated differently, Brief for Appellees in No. 17\xe2\x80\x93586, p. 27, but they offer no convincing reason for doing so.  No authority supports their argument.  The language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71253 and 1292(a)(1) makes no such distinction, and we have stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d analysis applies to the \xe2\x80\x9cgranting or denying\xe2\x80\x9d of injunctions.  <i>Gulfstream</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 287\xe2\x80\x93288.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, appellees\xe2\x80\x99 suggested distinction would put appellate courts in an awkward position.  Suppose that a district court granted an injunction that was narrower than the one requested by the moving party.  Would an appellate court (whether this Court or a court of appeals) have jurisdiction to rule on only part of that decision?  Suppose the appellate court concluded that the district court was correct in refusing to give the movant all the injunctive relief it sought because the movant\xe2\x80\x99s entire claim was doomed to fail.  Would the appellate court be limited to holding only that the lower court properly denied the relief that was withheld?  The rule advocated by the appellees would needlessly complicate appellate review.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, appellees point in passing to Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that an injunction \xe2\x80\x9cstate its terms specifically\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe in reasonable detail .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the act or acts restrained or required.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rules 65(d)(1)(B), (C); see Brief for Appellees in No. 17\xe2\x80\x93586, at 27.  But as explained in <i>Gunn</i> v. <i>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam</i>,\n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 389, n.\xc2\xa04 (1970), we have never suggested that a failure to meet the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d) would \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive the Court of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A contrary holding would be perverse.  Rule 65(b) protects the party against which an injunction is issued by requiring clear notice as to what that party must do or refrain from doing.  Where a vague injunction does not comply with Rule 65(b), the aggrieved party has a particularly strong need for appellate review.  It would be odd to hold that there can be no appeal in such a circumstance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, we hold that we have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253 to hear an appeal from an order that has the same practical effect as one granting or denying an injunction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With these principles settled, we conclude that the orders in these cases qualify as interlocutory injunctions under \xc2\xa71253.  The text of the orders and the context in which they were issued make this clear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The orders are unequivocal that the current legislative plans \xe2\x80\x9cviolate \xc2\xa72 and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d and that these violations \xe2\x80\x9cmust be remedied.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686; see also, <i>e.g.</i>, 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795 (\xe2\x80\x9c[V]iolations found by this Court in its Order on [the State House plan] now require a remedy\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Bell County, the intentional discrimination previously found by the Court must be remedied\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Dallas County, the intentional discrimination previously found by the Court must be remedied\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not suggest that this language alone is sufficient to show that the orders had the practical effect of enjoining use of the current plans in this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections, but the court did not stop with these pronouncements.  As we have noted, the orders required the Texas attorney general to inform the court within three days whether the Legislature would remedy the violations, and the orders stated that if the Legislature did not intend to adopt new plans, the court would hold remedial hearings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The short time given the Legislature to respond is strong evidence that the three-judge court did not intend to allow the elections to go ahead under the plans it had just condemned.  The Legislature was not in session, so in order to take up the task of redistricting, the Governor would have been required to convene a special session\xe2\x80\x94which is no small matter.  And, when the Governor declined to call a special session, the court moved ahead with its scheduled hearings and invited the parties to continue preparing for them even after this Court administratively stayed the August 15 order.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The import of these actions is unmistakable: The court intended to have new plans ready for use in this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections.  Nothing in the record even hints that the court contemplated the possibility of allowing the elections to proceed under the 2013 plans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What is more, Texas had reason to believe that it would risk deleterious consequences if it defied the court and attempted to conduct the elections under the plans that the court had found to be based on intentional racial discrimination.  In the very orders at issue, the court inferred discriminatory intent from Texas\xe2\x80\x99s choice to appeal the D. C. court\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance decision rather than immediately taking steps to bring its plans into compliance with that decision.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 649; see Part III, <i>infra</i>.  Reading such an order, Texas had reason to fear that if it tried to conduct elections under plans that the court had found to be racially discriminatory, the court would infer an evil motive and perhaps subject the State once again to the strictures of preclearance under \xc2\xa73(c) of the Voting Rights Act.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]  This is a remedy that the plaintiffs hoped to obtain, see, <i>e.g.</i>, App. 177a, and that the District Court seemed inclined to consider, see C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 122a\xe2\x80\x93123a (declining to declare moot the challenges to the long-since-repealed 2011 plans because \xe2\x80\x9cthere remains the possibility of declaratory and equitable relief under \xc2\xa73(c)\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contending that the orders here do not qualify under \xc2\xa71253, appellees analogize this case to <i>Gunn</i>,\n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, but there is no relevant similarity.  In <i>Gunn</i>, anti-war protesters were charged with violating a Texas \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing-the-peace statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 384, and they challenged the constitutionality of the statute in federal court.  After the state charges were dismissed, the District Court issued a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscursive\xe2\x80\x9d opinion \xe2\x80\x9cexpressing the view that [the statute was] constitutionally invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 386\xe2\x80\x93387.  But the court then refrained from going any further, \xe2\x80\x9cpending the next session, special or general, of the Texas legislature, at which time the State of Texas may, if it so desires, enact such disturbing-the-peace statute as will meet constitutional requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam </i>v. <i>Gunn</i>, 289 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 469, 475<i>\xc2\xa0</i>(WD Tex. 1968).<i> </i>The defendants appealed to this Court, and at the time of our decision two years later, neither the Legislature nor the District Court had taken any further action.  We therefore held that we lacked jurisdiction<i> </i>under \xc2\xa71253.  The District Court order in that case did not have the same practical effect as an injunction.  Indeed, it had no practical effect whatsoever and is thus entirely different from the orders now before us.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Appellees suggest that appellate jurisdiction is lacking in this case because we do not know at this point \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a remedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it would be implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees in No. 17\xe2\x80\x93586, at 27.  The dissent makes a similar argument with respect to two of the Texas House districts.  <i>Post</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]  But the issue here is whether this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections can be held under the plans enacted by the Legislature, not whether any particular remedies would have ulti- mately been ordered by the District Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Appellees and the dissent also fret that this Court will be inundated with redistricting appeals if we accept jurisdiction here, Brief for Appellees in No. 17\xe2\x80\x93626, p. 34; <i>post</i>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, and n.\xc2\xa08, but there is no reason to fear such a flood.  Because \xc2\xa71253 expressly authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cinterlocutory\xe2\x80\x9d appeals, there is no question that there can be more than one appeal in a case challenging a redistricting plan.  District courts sometimes expressly enjoin the use of districting plans before moving on to the remedial phase.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Whitford</i> v. <i>Gill</i>, No. 3:15\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93421, Doc. No. 190 (WD Wis., Feb. 22, 2017); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McCrory</i>, No. 1:13\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93949, Doc. No. 143 (MDNC, Feb. 5, 2016).  But appeals from such orders have not overwhelmed our docket.  Our holding here will affect only a small category of additional cases.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It should go without saying that our decision does not mean that a State can always appeal a district court order holding a redistricting plan unlawful.  A finding on liability cannot be appealed unless an injunction is granted or denied, and in some cases a district court may see no need for interlocutory relief.  If a plan is found to be unlawful long before the next scheduled election, a court may defer any injunctive relief until the case is completed.  And if a plan is found to be unlawful very close to the election date, the only reasonable option may be to use the plan one last time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We appreciate our obligation to heed the limits of our jurisdiction, and we reiterate that \xc2\xa71253 must be strictly construed.  But it also must be sensibly construed, and here the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders, for all intents and purposes, constituted injunctions barring the State from conducting this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections pursuant to a statute enacted by the Legislature.  Unless that statute is unconstitutional, this would seriously and irreparably harm[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>] the State, and only an interlocutory appeal can protect that State interest.  See <i>Carson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390.  As a result, \xc2\xa71253 provides jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now turn to the merits of the appeal.  The primary question is whether the Texas court erred when it required the State to show that the 2013 Legislature somehow purged the \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d that the court attributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior legislature in 2011.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State.  <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Bossier Parish School Bd.</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 481 (1997).  This rule takes on special significance in districting cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Redistricting \xe2\x80\x9cis primarily the duty and responsibility of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900, 915 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n assessing the sufficiency of a challenge to a districting plan,\xe2\x80\x9d a court \xe2\x80\x9cmust be sensitive to the complex interplay of forces that enter a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting calculus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 915\xe2\x80\x93916.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 915.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The allocation of the burden of proof and the presumption of legislative good faith are not changed by a finding of past discrimination.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]ast discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mobile</i>, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 74 (plurality opinion).  The \xe2\x80\x9cultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The \xe2\x80\x9chistorical background\xe2\x80\x9d of a legislative enactment is \xe2\x80\x9cone evidentiary source\xe2\x80\x9d relevant to the question of intent.  <i>Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252, 267 (1977).  But we have never suggested that past discrimination flips the evidentiary burden on its head.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither the District Court nor appellees have pointed to any authority that would justify shifting the burden.  The appellees rely primarily on <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Underwood</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222 (1985), but that case addressed a very different situation.  <i>Hunter </i>involved<i> </i>an equal protection challenge to an article of the Alabama Constitution adopted in 1901 at a constitutional convention avowedly dedicated to the establishment of white supremacy.  <i>Id.</i>, at 228\xe2\x80\x93230.  The article disenfranchised anyone convicted of any crime on a long list that included many minor offenses.  <i>Id.</i>, at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  The court below found that the article had been adopted with discriminatory intent, and this Court accepted that conclusion.  <i>Id.</i>, at 229.  The article was never repealed, but over the years, the list of disqualifying offenses had been pruned, and the State argued that what remained was facially constitutional.  <i>Id.</i>, at 232\xe2\x80\x93233.  This Court rejected that argument because the amendments did not alter the intent with which the article, including the parts that remained, had been adopted.  <i>Id.</i>, at 233.  But the Court specifically declined to address the question whether the then-existing version would have been valid if \xe2\x80\x9c[re]enacted today.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In these cases, we do not confront a situation like the one in <i>Hunter</i>.  Nor is this a case in which a law originally enacted with discriminatory intent is later reenacted by a different legislature.  The 2013 Texas Legislature did not reenact the plan previously passed by its 2011 predecessor.  Nor did it use criteria that arguably carried forward the effects of any discriminatory intent on the part of the 2011 Legislature.  Instead, it enacted, with only very small changes, plans that had been developed by the Texas court pursuant to instructions from this Court \xe2\x80\x9cnot to incorporate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any legal defects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perry</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 394.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt about what matters: It is the intent of the 2013 Legislature.  And it was the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 burden to overcome the presumption of legislative good faith and show that the 2013 Legislature acted with invidious intent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas court contravened these basic principles.  Instead of holding the plaintiffs to their burden of overcoming the presumption of good faith and proving discriminatory intent, it reversed the burden of proof.  It imposed on the State the obligation of proving that the 2013 Legislature had experienced a true \xe2\x80\x9cchange of heart\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9cengage[d] in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 649.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s references to the need to \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d the earlier Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be dismissed as stray comments.  On the contrary, they were central to the court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  The court referred repeatedly to the 2013 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s duty to expiate its predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s bad intent, and when the court summarized its analysis, it drove the point home.  It stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe discriminatory taint [from the 2011 plans] was not removed by the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 686.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent labors to explain away all these references to the 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s supposed duty to purge its predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly discriminatory intent, but the dissent loses track of its own argument and characterizes the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning exactly as we have.  Indeed, the dissent criticizes us on page 33 of its opinion for saying precisely the same thing that it said 11 pages earlier.  On page 33, the dissent states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he majority quotes the orders as requiring proof that the Legislature \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98engage[d] in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  But the District Court did not put the burden on Texas to make that affirmative showing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (quoting <i>supra</i>, at 23,<i> </i>in turn quoting 274 F.

The dissent writes that the District Court was required \xe2\x80\x9cto assess how the 2013 Legislature addressed the known discrimination that motivated\xe2\x80\x9d the districts approved by that Court in 2012.  <i>Post</i>, at 31.  The dissent quotes the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there is no indication that the Legislature looked to see whether any discriminatory taint remained in the plans.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 24 (quoting 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 649).  And there is also this: \xe2\x80\x9cTexas was just \xe2\x80\x98not truly interested in fixing any remaining discrimination in [its 2011 maps].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 22 (quoting 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 651, n.\xc2\xa045).  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s true mode of analysis is so obvious that the dissent cannot help but repeat it.  And that approach was fundamentally flawed and demands reversal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While a district court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of fact on the question of discriminatory intent is reviewed for clear error, see <i>Cromartie</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242, whether the court applied the correct burden of proof is a question of law subject to plenary review, <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. Bank N.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Village at Lakeridge, LLC</i>, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 5); <i>Highmark Inc.</i> v. <i>Allcare Health Management System, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).

Rather, both the intent of the 2011 Legislature and the court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the interim plans are relevant to the extent that they naturally give rise to\xe2\x80\x94or tend to refute\xe2\x80\x94inferences regarding the intent of the 2013 Legislature.  They must be weighed together with any other direct and circumstantial evidence of that Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  But when all the relevant evidence in the record is taken into account, it is plainly insufficient to prove that the 2013 Legislature acted in bad faith and engaged in intentional discrimination.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 585 (2009); <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 467, 497 (1991).  There is thus no need for any further prolongation of this already protracted litigation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only direct evidence brought to our attention suggests that the 2013 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent was legitimate.  It wanted to bring the litigation about the State\xe2\x80\x99s districting plans to an end as expeditiously as possible.  The attorney general advised the Legislature that the best way to do this was to adopt the interim, court-issued plans.  The sponsor of the 2013 plans voiced the same objective, and the Legislature then adopted the court-approved plans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On its face, this explanation of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent is entirely reasonable and certainly legitimate.  The Legislature had reason to know that any new plans it devised were likely to be attacked by one group of plaintiffs or another.  (The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 conflicting positions with regard to some of the districts in the plans now before us bear this out.)  Litigating districting cases is expensive and time consuming, and until the districts to be used in the next election are firmly established, a degree of uncertainty clouds the electoral process.  Wishing to minimize these effects is understandable and proper.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court below discounted this direct evidence, but its reasons for doing so are not sound.  The court stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy\xe2\x80\x9d of the 2013 Legislature was to \xe2\x80\x9cinsulate [the plans] from further challenge, regardless of [the plans\xe2\x80\x99] legal infirmities.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 650; see also <i>id.</i>, at 651, n.\xc2\xa045.  But there is no evidence that the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to gain acceptance of plans that it knew were unlawful.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>]  Indeed, there is no evidence that the Legislature thought that the plans were invalid\xe2\x80\x94and as we will explain, the Legislature had sound reasons to believe just the opposite.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">21</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court found it significant that the Legislature must have realized that enacting the interim plans would not \xe2\x80\x9cend the litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d because it knew that at least some plaintiffs would pursue their challenges anyway.  <i>Id.</i>, at 651, n. 45.  But even if, as seems likely, the Legislature did not think that all the plaintiffs would immediately abandon all their claims, it does not follow that the Legislature was insincere in stating that it adopted the court-approved plan with the aim of bringing the litigation to a close.  It was reasonable for the Legislature to think that approving the court-approved plans might at least reduce objections and thus simplify and expedite the conclusion of the litigation.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a>]  That MALDEF, counsel for one of the plaintiff groups, testified in favor of the plans is evidence that the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s objective was reasonable.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 436a\xe2\x80\x93439a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not only does the direct evidence suggest that the 2013 Legislature lacked discriminatory intent, but the circumstantial evidence points overwhelmingly to the same conclusion.  Consider the situation when the Legislature adopted the court-approved interim plans.  First, the Texas court had adopted those plans, and no one would claim that the court acted with invidious intent when it did so.  Second, the Texas court approved those plans only after reviewing them and modifying them as required to comply with our instructions.  Not one of the judges on that court expressed the view that the plans were unlawful.  Third, we had directed the Texas court to make changes in response to any claims under the Equal Protection Clause and \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act if those claims were merely likely to prevail.  <i>Perry</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 394.  And the Texas court was told to accommodate any claim under \xc2\xa75 of the VRA unless it was \xe2\x80\x9cinsubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 395.  Fourth, the Texas court had made a careful analysis of all the claims, had provided a detailed examination of individual districts, and had modified many districts.  Its work was anything but slapdash.  All these facts gave the Legislature good reason to believe that the court-approved interim plans were legally sound.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Is there any evidence from which a contrary inference can reasonably be drawn?  Appellees stress the preliminary nature of the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the interim plans, and as we have said, that fact is relevant.  But in light of our instructions to the Texas court and the care with which the interim plans were developed, the court\xe2\x80\x99s approval still gave the Legislature a sound basis for thinking that the interim plans satisfied all legal requirements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court below and the dissent infer bad faith because the Legislature \xe2\x80\x9cpushed the redistricting bills through quickly in a special session.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 649.  But we do not see how the brevity of the legislative process can give rise to an inference of bad faith\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not an inference that is strong enough to overcome the presumption of legislative good faith (a concept to which the dissent pays only the briefest lip service, <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at 21).  The \xe2\x80\x9cspecial session\xe2\x80\x9d was necessary because the regular session had ended.  As explained, the Legislature had good reason to believe that the interim plans were sound, and the adoption of those already-completed plans did not require a prolonged process.  After all, part of the reason for adopting those plans was to avoid the time and expense of starting from scratch and leaving the electoral process in limbo while that occurred.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">23</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court and the dissent also err when they charge that Representative Darby, the chair of the Texas House Redistricting Committee at the time in question, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98willfully ignored those who pointed out deficiencies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the plans.  <i>Post</i>, at 23 (quoting 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 651, n.\xc2\xa045).  This accusation is not only misleading, it misses the point.  The Legislature adopted the interim plans in large part because they had the preliminary approval of the District Court, and Darby was open about the fact that he wanted to minimize amendments to the plans for that reason.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>Joint Exh. 17.3, pp. S1\xe2\x80\x93S2.  That Darby generally hoped to minimize amendments\xe2\x80\x94so that the plans would remain legally compliant\xe2\x80\x94hardly shows that he, or the Legislature, acted with discriminatory intent.  In any event, it is misleading to characterize this attitude as \xe2\x80\x9cwillfu[l] ignor[ance].\xe2\x80\x9d   The record shows that, al- though Darby hoped to minimize amendments, he did not categorically refuse to consider changes.  This is illustrated by his support for an amendment to HD90, which was offered by the then-incumbent, Democrat Lon Burnam, precisely because it fixed an objection raised by the Mexican-American Legal Caucus (MALC) that the district\xe2\x80\x99s Latino population was too low.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 790.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">24</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas court faulted the 2013 Legislature for failing to take into account the problems with the 2011 plans that the D. C. court identified in denying preclearance, <i>ibid.</i>,<i> </i>but the basis for that criticism is hard to understand.  One of the 2013 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s principal reasons for adopting the court-approved plans was to fix the problems identified by the D. C. court.  The attorney general advised the Legislature to adopt the interim plans because he thought that was the \xe2\x80\x9cbest way to remedy the violations found by the D. C. court.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. J. S. 432a.  Chairman Darby similarly stated that the 2013 plans fixed the errors found by the D. C. court, Tr. 1498, 1584\xe2\x80\x931585 (July 14, 2017), as did Senator Seliger, Joint Exh. 26.2, p. A\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is nothing to suggest that the Legislature proceeded in bad faith\xe2\x80\x94or even that it acted unreasonably\xe2\x80\x94in pursuing this strategy.  Recall that we instructed the Texas court, in developing the interim plans, to remedy any \xc2\xa75 claim that was \xe2\x80\x9cnot insubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perry</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 395.  And that is just what the interim plans, which the Legislature later enacted, attempted to do.  For instance, the D. C. court held that the congressional plan had one too few \xe2\x80\x9cability to elect\xe2\x80\x9d districts for Latinos, largely because of changes to CD23, <i>Texas</i>, 887 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 156\xe2\x80\x93159; the interim plan (and, by extension, the 2013 plan) amended CD23, C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 397a\xe2\x80\x93399a.  Similarly, in the plan for the Texas House, the D. C. court found \xc2\xa75 retrogression with respect to HD35, HD117, and HD149, <i>Texas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 167\xe2\x80\x93175, and all of those districts were changed in the 2013 plans, H.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 305a\xe2\x80\x93307a, 312a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the D. C. court found that the 2011 Legislature acted with discriminatory intent in framing the congressional plan, that finding was based on evidence about districts that the interim plan later changed.  The D. C. court was concerned about the intent reflected in the drawing of CDs 9, 18, and 30, but all those districts were amended by the Texas court.  <i>Texas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 159\xe2\x80\x93160; C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 406a\xe2\x80\x93408a.  With respect to the plan for the Texas House, the D. C. court made no intent findings, but its areas of concern were generally addressed by the Texas court and the 2013 plans.  Compare <i>Texas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 178 (noting evidence of unlawful intent in HD117), with H. J. S. 307a (amending HD117).[<a href="#F25" name="T25">25</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is indicative of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken approach that it inferred bad faith from Texas\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take an appeal to this Court from the D. C. court\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying preclearance.  See 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 649 (\xe2\x80\x9cDefendants did not accept [these findings] and instead appealed to the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress gave the State the right to appeal, and no bad motive can be inferred from its decision to make use of this right\xe2\x80\x94unless of course the State had no reasonable grounds for appeal.  Before our decision in <i>Shelby County </i>mooted Texas\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to this Court from the D. C. court\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance decision, Texas filed a jurisdictional statement claiming that the D. C. court made numerous errors, but the Texas court made no attempt to show that Texas\xe2\x80\x99s arguments were frivolous.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a final note, appellees assert that the 2013 Legislature should have either defended the 2011 plans in litigation or gone back to the drawing board and devised en- tirely new plans, Brief for Appellees in No. 17\xe2\x80\x93626, at 45, but there is no reason why the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s options should be limited in this way.  It was entirely permissible for the Legislature to favor a legitimate option that promised to simplify and reduce the burden of litigation.  That the Legislature chose this course is not proof of discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Once the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s intent finding is reversed, there remain only four districts that were invalidated on alternative grounds.  For three of these districts, the District Court relied on the \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d test of \xc2\xa72.  We reverse as to each of these, but we affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s final holding that HD90 is a racial gerrymander.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To make out a \xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d claim, a plaintiff must establish the three so-called \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Gingles</i> factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  These are (1) a geographically compact minority population sufficient to constitute a majority in a single-member district, (2) political cohesion among the members of the minority group, and (3) bloc voting by the majority to defeat the minority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate.  <i>Gingles</i>,<i> </i>478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9351; <i>LULAC</i>, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 425.  If a plaintiff makes that showing, it must then go on to prove that, under the totality of the circumstances, the district lines dilute the votes of the members of the minority group.  <i>Id.</i>, at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Texas court held that CD27 violates \xc2\xa72 of the VRA because it has the effect of diluting the votes of Latino voters in Nueces County.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 191a.  CD27 is anchored in Nueces County (home to Corpus Christi) and follows the Gulf of Mexico to the northeast before taking a turn inland to the northwest in the direction of Austin.  Nueces County contains a Latino population of roughly 200,000 (a little less than one-third the size of an ideal Texas congressional district), and the court held that the Nueces County Latinos should have been included in a Latino opportunity district, rather than CD27, which is not such a district.  The court found that an area centered on Nueces County satisfies the <i>Gingles</i> factors and that, under the totality of the circumstances, the placement of the Nueces County Latinos in CD27 deprives them of the equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 181a\xe2\x80\x93195a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem with this holding is that plaintiffs could not establish a violation of \xc2\xa72 of the VRA without showing that there is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d opportunity districts.  <i>LULAC</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 430.  And as the Texas court itself found, the geography and demographics of south and west Texas do not permit the creation of any more than the seven Latino opportunity districts that exist under the current plan.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 684, and n. 85.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Attempting to get around this problem, the Texas court relied on our decision in <i>LULAC</i>, but it misapplied our holding.  In <i>LULAC</i>, we held that the State should have created six proper Latino opportunity districts but instead drew only five.  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435.  Although the State claimed that the plan actually included a sixth opportunity district, that district failed to satisfy the <i>Gingles</i> factors.  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430.  We held that a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s creation of an opportunity district for those without a \xc2\xa72 right offers no excuse for its failure to provide an opportunity district for those with a \xc2\xa72 right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the Texas court concluded that Texas committed the same violation as in <i>LULAC</i>: It created \xe2\x80\x9can opportu-nity district for those without a \xc2\xa72 right\xe2\x80\x9d (the Latinos in CD35), while failing to create such a district \xe2\x80\x9cfor those with a \xc2\xa72 right\xe2\x80\x9d (the Latinos of Nueces County).  <i>Ibid.</i>  This holding is based on a flawed analysis of CD35.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">CD35 lies to the north of CD27 and runs along I\xe2\x80\x9335 from San Antonio up to Austin, the center of Travis County.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Latinos of CD35 do not have a \xc2\xa72 right because one of the <i>Gingles</i> factors, majority bloc voting, is not present.  The Court reached this conclusion because the non-Latino voters of Travis County tend to favor the same candidates as the great majority of Latinos.  There are two serious problems with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Court took the wrong approach in evaluating the presence of majority bloc voting in CD35.  The Court looked at only one, small part of the district, the portion that falls within Travis County.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 683; C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 175a\xe2\x80\x93176a.  But Travis County makes up only 21% of the district.  We have made clear that redistricting analysis must take place at the district level.  <i>Bethune-Hill</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  In failing to perform that district-level analysis, the District Court went astray.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, here, unlike in <i>LULAC</i>, the 2013 Legislature had \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons\xe2\x80\x9d to believe that the district at issue (here CD35) was a viable Latino opportunity district that satisfied the <i>Gingles</i> factors.  CD35 was based on a concept proposed by MALDEF, C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. Findings 315a\xe2\x80\x93316a, and the Latino Redistricting Task Force (a plaintiff group) argued that the district is mandated by \xc2\xa72.  C. J. S. 174a.  The only <i>Gingles</i> factor disputed by the court was majority bloc voting, and there is ample evidence that this factor is met.  Indeed, the court found that majority bloc voting exists throughout the State.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. Findings 467a.  In addition, the District Court extensively analyzed CD35 in 2012 and determined that it was likely not a racial gerrymander and that even if it was, it likely satisfied strict scrutiny.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 415a.  In other words, the 2013 Legislature justifiably thought that it had placed a viable opportunity district along the I\xe2\x80\x9335 corridor.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The District Court similarly erred in holding that HD32 and HD34 violate \xc2\xa72.  These districts make up the entirety of Nueces County, which has a population that is almost exactly equal to twice the population of an ideal Texas House district.  (It can fit 2.0295 ideal districts.  H.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. Findings 91a.)  In 2010, Latinos made up approximately 56% of the voting age population of the county.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The 2013 plan created two districts that lie wholly within the county; one, HD34, is a Latino opportunity district, but the other, HD32, is not.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 767.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Findings made by the court below show that these two districts do not violate \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.  Under <i>Gingles</i>, the ultimate question is whether a districting decision dilutes the votes of minority voters, see <i>LULAC</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 425\xe2\x80\x93426, and it is hard to see how this standard could be met if the alternative to the districting decision at issue would not enhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of their choice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only plaintiff that pressed a \xc2\xa72 claim with respect to HD32 and HD34 was MALC, 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 767, and as the District Court recognized, that group\xe2\x80\x99s own expert determined that it was not possible to divide Nueces County into more than one <i>performing</i> Latino district.  In his analysis, the expert relied on Nueces County election returns for statewide elections between 2010 and 2016.  <i>Id.</i>, at 775\xe2\x80\x93776.  Based on this data, he calculated that when both HD32 and HD34 were maintained as Latino-majority districts, one performed for Latinos in only 7 out of 35 relevant elections, and the other did so in <i>none</i> of the 35 elections.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In order to create two performing districts in that area, it was necessary, he found, to break county lines in <i>multiple</i> places, <i>id.</i>, at 778, but the District Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking the County Line Rule\xe2\x80\x9d in the Texas Constitution, see Art. III, \xc2\xa726, to \xe2\x80\x9cremove Anglos and incorporate even more Hispanics to improve electoral outcomes goes beyond what \xc2\xa72 requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 783.  So if Texas could <i>not </i>create two performing districts in Nueces County and did <i>not</i> have to break county lines, the logical result is that Texas did not dilute the Latino vote.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court refused to accept this conclusion, but its reasons for doing so cannot stand up.  As an initial matter, the court thought that the two districts would have to be redrawn based on its finding regarding the intent of the 2013 Legislature,[<a href="#F26" name="T26">26</a>] and it therefore deferred a final decision on the \xc2\xa72 issue and advised the plaintiffs to consider at the remedial phase of the case whether they preferred to have two districts that might not perform or just one safe district.  <i>Id.</i>, at 783.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s decision cannot be sustained on this ground, since its finding of discriminatory intent is erroneous.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only other reason provided by the court was the observation that MALC \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to show\xe2\x80\x9d that two majority-Latino districts in Nueces County would not perform.  <i>Id.</i>, at 782.  This observation twisted the burden of proof beyond recognition.  It suggested that a plaintiff might succeed on its \xc2\xa72 claim because its expert failed to show that the necessary factual basis for the claim could not be established.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">27</a>]  Courts cannot find \xc2\xa72 effects violations on the basis of <i>uncertainty</i>.  In any event, if even the District Court remains unsure how to draw these districts to comply with \xc2\xa72 (after six years of litigation, almost a dozen trials, and numerous opinions), the Legislature surely had the \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98broad discretion\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d to comply as it reasonably saw fit in 2013, <i>LULAC</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 429.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent charges us with ignoring the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intensely local appraisal\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 of Nueces County, <i>post</i>, at 44, but almost none of the \xe2\x80\x9cfindings\xe2\x80\x9d that the District Court made with respect to HD32 and HD34 referred to present local conditions, and none cast any significant light on the question whether another opportunity district is possible at the present time.  For instance, what the dissent describes as Texas\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clong \xe2\x80\x98history of voting-related discrimination,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, in no way undermines\xe2\x80\x94or even has any logical bearing on\xe2\x80\x94the conclusions reached by MALC\xe2\x80\x99s expert about whether Latino voters would have a real opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice if the county was divided into two districts with narrow majorities of Latino citizens of voting age.  The same is true with respect to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings regarding racially polarized voting in the county and Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing pattern of disadvantage relative to\xe2\x80\x9d non-Latinos.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 779 (internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps recognizing as much, both the District Court and the dissent point to the anticipated future growth in the percentage of eligible voters of Latino descent, but the districts now at issue would not necessar-ily be used beyond 2020, after which time the 2020 census would likely require redistricting once again.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">HD90 is a district in Tarrant County that, unlike the other districts at issue in this appeal, was not copied from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interim plans.  Instead, the 2013 Legislature substantially modified the district developed by the District Court, and the District Court held that the 2013 Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s creation is an invalid racial gerrymander.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 794.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In drawing HD90, the Legislature was pulled in opposite directions by competing groups.  In 2011, the Legislature, responding to pressure from MALDEF, increased the Latino population of the district in an effort to make it a Latino opportunity district.  H.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. Findings 258a\xe2\x80\x93262a.  In the process of doing so, the Legislature moved the community of Como, which is predominantly African-American, out of the district.  But Como residents and the member of the Texas House who represented the district, Lon Burnam, objected, and in 2013, the Legislature moved Como back into the district.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 788\xe2\x80\x93789.  That change was opposed by MALC because it decreased the Latino population below 50%.  App. 398a\xe2\x80\x93399a.  So the Legislature moved Latinos into the district to bring the Latino population back above 50%.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 789\xe2\x80\x93790.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of these maneuvers, Texas does not dispute that race was the predominant factor in the design of HD90, but it argues that this was permissible because it had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>good reasons</i> to believe\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d that this was necessary to satisfy \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bethune-Hill</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Texas offers two pieces of evidence to support its claim.  The first\xe2\x80\x94that one of the plaintiffs, MALC, demanded as much\xe2\x80\x94is insufficient.  A group that wants a State to create a district with a particular design may come to have an overly expansive understanding of what \xc2\xa72 demands.  So one group\xe2\x80\x99s demands alone cannot be enough.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The other item of evidence consists of the results of the Democratic primaries in 2012 and 2014.  In 2012, Representative Burnham, who was not the Latino candidate of choice, narrowly defeated a Latino challenger by 159 votes.  And in 2014, the present representative, Ramon Romero, Jr., beat Burnam by 110 votes.  See Brief for Appellants 70.  These election returns may be suggestive, but standing alone, they were not enough to give the State good reason to conclude that it had to alter the district\xe2\x80\x99s lines solely on the basis of race.

In reaching its desired result, the majority commits three fundamental errors along the way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the majority disregards the strict limits of our appellate jurisdiction and reads into the District Court orders a nonexistent injunction to justify its premature intervention.  Second, the majority indulges Texas\xe2\x80\x99 distorted reading of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s meticulous orders, mistakenly faulting the court for supposedly shifting the burden of proof to the State to show that it cured the taint of past discrimination, all the while ignoring the clear language and unambiguous factual findings of the orders below.  Third, the majority elides the standard of review that guides our resolution of the factual disputes in these appeals\xe2\x80\x94indeed, mentioning it only in passing\xe2\x80\x94and selectively parses through the facts.  As a result of these errors, Texas is guaranteed continued use of much of its discriminatory maps.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy.  It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas\xe2\x80\x94despite constituting a majority of the population within the State\xe2\x80\x94will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.  Those voters must return to the polls in 2018 and 2020 with the knowledge that their ability to exercise meaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will.  The fundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this manner.  I dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The first obstacle the majority faces in its quest to intervene in these cases is jurisdictional.  The statute that governs our jurisdiction over these appeals is\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike the more typical certiorari process, for cases falling within \xc2\xa71253, appellate review in this Court is mandatory.  That is why, until today, this Court has repeatedly recognized and adhered to a \xe2\x80\x9clong-established rule\xe2\x80\x9d requiring \xe2\x80\x9cstrict construction\xe2\x80\x9d of this jurisdictional statute \xe2\x80\x9cto protect our appellate docket.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stainback</i> v. <i>Mo Hock Ke Lok Po</i>,\n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 368, 375, 378 (1949); see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Automatic Employees Credit Union</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 90, 98 (1974) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9conly a narrow construction\xe2\x80\x9d of our jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253 \xe2\x80\x9cis consonant with the overriding policy, historically encouraged by Congress, of minimizing the mandatory docket of this Court in the interests of sound judicial administration\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Gunn</i> v. <i>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam</i>,\n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 387 (1970) (similar); <i>Goldstein</i> v. <i>Cox</i>,\n\n396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (1970) (rejecting a construction of \xc2\xa71253 that would \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve an expansion of [our] mandatory appellate jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d even where the statutory text \xe2\x80\x9cis subject to [that] construction,\xe2\x80\x9d in light of \xe2\x80\x9ccanon of construction\xe2\x80\x9d requiring that \xc2\xa71253 be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly construed\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Phillips</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246, 248\xe2\x80\x93250 (1941) (explaining that \xc2\xa71253 is an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional procedure\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cinasmuch as this procedure .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. brings direct review of a district court to this Court, any loose construction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would defeat the purposes of Congress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to keep within narrow confines our appellate docket\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In line with that command, this Court has held that a ruling on the merits will not suffice to invoke our mandatory appellate jurisdiction in the absence of an order granting or denying an injunction.  In fact, even if a three-judge district court unequivocally indicates that a state law must be enjoined as it stands, we have required more before accepting mandatory review.  For example, the Court in <i>Gunn</i> found no jurisdiction where the three-judge District Court held that a Texas disturbing-the-peace statute was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impermissibly and unconstitutionally broad,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d concluded that the plaintiffs were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98entitled to their declaratory judgment to that effect, and to injunctive relief against the enforcement of [the statute] as now worded, insofar as it may affect the rights guaranteed under the\n \nFirst Amendment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and stayed the mandate to allow the State to, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98if it so desires, enact such disturbing-the-peace statute as will meet constitutional requirements.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 386.  Despite the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the merits and its clear indication that, unless amended, the disturbing-the-peace statute would be enjoined, this Court dismissed an appeal from the State for want of jurisdiction, concluding that the District Court merely wrote a \xe2\x80\x9crather discursive <i>per curiam</i> opinion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no order of any kind either granting or denying an injunction\xe2\x80\x94interlocutory or permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 387.  The Court explained that, in addition to the congressional command to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98keep within narrow confines our appellate docket,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d other \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy considerations\xe2\x80\x9d counseled limiting \xe2\x80\x9cour power of review,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cthat until a district court issues an injunction, or enters an order denying one, it is simply not possible to know with any certainty what the court has decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 387\xe2\x80\x93388.  Those considerations, the Court thought, were \xe2\x80\x9cconspicuously evident\xe2\x80\x9d in that case, where the opinion did not specify, for instance, exactly what was to be enjoined or against whom the injunction would run.  <i>Id.,</i> at 388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, <i>Whitcomb</i> v. <i>Chavis</i>,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124 (1971), concerned a redistricting challenge in which a three-judge District Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca redistricting of [the challenged county was] necessitated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat the evidence adduced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the additional apportionment requirements set forth by the Supreme Court call[ed] for a redistricting of the entire state as to both houses of the General Assembly,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Chavis</i> v. <i>Whitcomb</i>, 305 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1364, 1391 (SD Ind. 1969).  Recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthat the federal judiciary functions within a system of federalism which entrusts the responsibility of legislative apportionment and districting primarily to the state legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court afforded the Governor \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable opportunity to call a Special Session of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana so that it may enact legislation to redistrict the State and reapportion the legislative seats in the General Assembly in accordance with federal constitutional requirements and in compliance with [its] opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1392.  The District Court gave the State a little over two months to enact new statutes \xe2\x80\x9cto remedy the improper districting and malapportionment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  When the Governor appealed from that order, this Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction because \xe2\x80\x9cat [the] time no judgment had been entered and no injunction had been granted or denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  403 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 138, n.\xc2\xa019.  The findings of liability on the merits and the unequivocal indication that the redistricting and malapportionment violations had to be remedied were not enough.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Straightforward application of this precedent compels the conclusion that this Court lacks jurisdiction over these appeals.  Here, Texas appeals from two orders entered by the three-judge District Court on August 15 and 24, 2017.  Those orders concern the constitutional and statutory challenges to Texas\xe2\x80\x99 State House and federal congressional redistricting plans, enacted by the Texas Legislature (hereinafter Legislature) in 2013 (hereinafter the 2013 maps).  As relevant here, the orders concerned Texas House districts in Bell County (HD54 and HD55), Dallas County (HD103, HD104, and HD105), Nueces County (HD32 and HD34), and Tarrant County (HD90), as well federal congressional districts encompassing Nueces County (CD27) and parts of Travis County (CD35).  The District Court concluded that plaintiffs had proved intentional discrimination as to HD54, HD55, HD103, HD104, HD105, HD32, HD34, and CD27.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  It also concluded that plaintiffs had proved a \xe2\x80\x9cresults\xe2\x80\x9d violation under \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act as to HD32, HD34, and CD27,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] and had established a racial gerrymandering claim as to HD90 and CD35.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Having ruled on the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 statutory and constitutional claims, the District Court stated that all but one of the \xe2\x80\x9cviolations must be remedied by either the Texas Legislature or [the District] Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 624, 686 (WD Tex. 2017); see also 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 750, 795 (WD Tex. 2017).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  With respect to the \xc2\xa72 results violation concerning HD32 and HD34, however, the District Court noted that it had yet to decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether \xc2\xa72 requires a remedy for this results violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 783, 795.  The District Court then ordered \xe2\x80\x9cthe [Texas] Office of the Attorney General to file a written advisory within three business days stating whether the Legislature intends to take up redistricting in an effort to cure these violations and, if so, when the matter will be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686; see also 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795.  The court went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Legislature does not intend to take up redistricting, the [District] Court will hold a hearing to consider remedial plans\xe2\x80\x9d on September 5 and 6, 2017, respecting the congressional and Texas House districts.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686\xe2\x80\x93687; see also 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn preparation for the hearing[s],\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court ordered the parties to confer and to \xe2\x80\x9ctake immediate steps to consult with their experts and mapdrawers and prepare\xe2\x80\x9d maps to present at those hearings.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 687; 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court went no further.  Though there had been a determination on the merits that Texas violated both the Equal Protection Clause and \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act with respect to a number of districts in the 2013 maps, the District Court did not enjoin use of the 2013 maps for the upcoming 2018 elections.  For instance, with respect to the congressional map, the District Court explained that its order \xe2\x80\x9conly partially addresse[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 claims, as it had \xe2\x80\x9cbifurcated the remedial phase\xe2\x80\x9d from the merits phase.  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 687.  Importantly, in denying Texas\xe2\x80\x99 motions for a stay, the District Court took care to make abundantly clear the scope of its orders: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the [District] Court found violations [in the congressional and Texas House maps], the [District] Court has not enjoined [their] use for any upcoming elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 134a\xe2\x80\x93136a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is the end of the inquiry under our precedent, as our past cases are directly on point.  Like in <i>Gunn</i> and <i>Whitcomb</i>, the District Court issued a ruling on the merits against the State.  Like in <i>Gunn</i> and <i>Whitcomb</i>, the District Court was clear that those violations required a remedy.  Like in <i>Gunn</i> and <i>Whitcomb</i>, the District Court stayed its hand and did not enter an injunction, instead allowing the State an opportunity to remedy the violations.  Therefore, like in <i>Gunn</i> and <i>Whitcomb</i>, this Court lacks jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253 because there is \xe2\x80\x9cno order of any kind either granting or denying an injunction\xe2\x80\x94interlocutory or permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gunn</i>, 399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 387.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Despite this precedent, the majority nonetheless concludes that our intervention at this early stage is not only authorized, but mandatory.  None of the justifications that the majority offers for deviating from our precedent is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority justifies its jurisdictional overreach by holding that \xc2\xa71253 mandates appellate review in this Court if a three-judge district court order \xe2\x80\x9chas the \xe2\x80\x98practical effect\xe2\x80\x99 of granting or denying an injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.  It reasons that the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously made clear that where an order has the \xe2\x80\x98practical effect\xe2\x80\x99 of granting or denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That reasoning, however, has no application here.  Whereas this Court has applied the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule in the context of the courts of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 appellate jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(a)(1), it has never applied it to questions of its own mandatory appellate docket under \xc2\xa71253.  That explains why the only cases the majority can round up to support its position concern jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1).  <i>Ante,</i> at 12 (citing <i>Carson</i> v. <i>American Brands, Inc.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79, 83\xe2\x80\x9384 (1981), and <i>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</i> v. <i>Mayacamas Corp.</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 271, 287\xe2\x80\x93288 (1988)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This distinction matters a great deal.  Courts of appeals generally have jurisdiction over direct appeals from the district courts.  See 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73901, p.\xc2\xa013 (3d ed. 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cCourts of appeals jurisdiction extends to nearly every action that might be taken by a district court\xe2\x80\x9d).  In contrast, exercising mandatory review over direct appeals in this Court is a truly \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Phillips</i>, 312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, in no small part due to our \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily finite docket,\xe2\x80\x9d 16B Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74003, at 19.  Reading \xc2\xa71253 broadly risks transforming that exceptional procedure into a routine matter, when our precedent commands a strict construction precisely so that we can \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98keep within narrow confines our appellate docket.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Goldstein</i>, 396 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brushing that distinction aside, the majority contends that \xe2\x80\x9cwe also construe Section 1292(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x98narrowly,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and have referred to the statutes as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98analogous.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  True, but that is no response to the jurisdictional obstacle of \xc2\xa71253.  The command from our precedent is not simply one to undertake the same narrow interpretation as we do for \xc2\xa71292(a)(1).  Rather, our \xe2\x80\x9clong-established rule\xe2\x80\x9d requires \xe2\x80\x9cstrict construction\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71253, <i>Stainback</i>, 336 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 378, so that even where the statutory text could be read to expand our mandatory appellate docket, this Court will not adopt that reading if a narrower construction is available, <i>Goldstein</i>, 396 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 477\xe2\x80\x93478.  That \xe2\x80\x9cstrict construction\xe2\x80\x9d rule exists for a purpose specific to this Court: to protect our \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully limited appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of Tex. System</i> v. <i>New Left Ed. Project</i>,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 541, 543 (1972).  Unlike the courts of appeals, which hear cases on mandatory jurisdiction regularly, this Court hears cases on mandatory jurisdiction only rarely.  The majority nowhere grapples with that vital contextual distinction between \xc2\xa71253 and \xc2\xa71292(a)(1).  Nor does the majority acknowledge that, in interpreting \xc2\xa71253, this Court has itself recognized that distinction, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court <i>above all others</i> must limit its review of interlocutory orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Goldstein</i>, 396 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Looking to escape that pitfall in its reasoning, the majority turns to the text of the two jurisdictional statutes.  But the text provides no refuge for its position.  The majority first states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant language in the two provisions is nearly identical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  But whereas \xc2\xa71253 provides for appeal \xe2\x80\x9cfrom an order granting or denying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an interlocutory or permanent injunction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) provides for appeal from \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nterlocutory orders .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a stretch, to say the least, to characterize these provisions as \xe2\x80\x9cnearly identical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Next, the majority contends that \xc2\xa71253 and \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) are \xe2\x80\x9ctextually interlocked,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 14, in that \xc2\xa71292(a)(1) provides for appeal to the courts of appeals, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  In its view, this demonstrates that the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule must apply under \xc2\xa71253.  The majority reasons that \xe2\x80\x9cthe consequences would be unfortunate and strange\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise, imagining that an order from a three-judge district court that had the practical effect of an injunction but did not invoke \xc2\xa71253 jurisdiction would \xe2\x80\x9cappear to be appealable to one of the courts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, a result \xe2\x80\x9cCongress surely did not intend\xe2\x80\x9d given that it took \xe2\x80\x9cpains to provide for review in this Court, and not in the courts of appeals, of three-judge court orders granting injunctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This reasoning rests on a mistaken premise.  Congress did not provide for review of <i>every</i> three-judge court order in this Court.  It provided for review of only certain narrow categories of orders, <i>i.e., </i>those granting or denying an injunction.  There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstrange\xe2\x80\x9d about the proposition that orders from a three-judge court that do not fall within these narrow categories of actions made directly appealable to this Court can be appealed only to the courts of appeals.  In fact, this Court itself has recognized as much.  See, <i>e.g., Rockefeller</i> v. <i>Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn &amp; Queens, Inc.</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 820 (1970) (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judgment appealed from does not include an order granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent injunction and is therefore not appealable to this Court under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.\xc2\xa0 The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to that court so that it may enter a fresh decree from which timely appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)); see also<i> Mitchell</i> v. <i>Donovan</i>,\n\n398 U.\xc2\xa0S. 427, 431\xe2\x80\x93432 (1970) (<i>per curiam</i>) (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court lacks jurisdiction of the appeal\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71253 and directing \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court [to] enter a fresh order .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. thus affording the appellants an opportunity to take a timely appeal to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  And to the extent a party prematurely appeals to the court of appeals an order that would otherwise fall within \xc2\xa71253, <i>e.g., </i>if Texas had appealed the August 15 and 24 orders to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, that court surely will be more than capable of identifying as much and instructing the party to wait for an actual injunction before bringing an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority attempts to bolster its jurisdictional conclusion with a passing reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable purpose\xe2\x80\x9d served by the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule, <i>i.e., </i>preventing district courts from manipulating proceedings by avoiding labeling their orders as \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Notably, the majority cites no evidence for the proposition that district courts are engaging in any kind of manipulation.  Nor is there any indication that the District Court here attempted to manipulate the proceedings by shielding its orders from appellate review.  Instead, the District Court carefully adhered to a common practice in cases implicating important state interests, staying its hand as to the remedy to allow the State an opportunity to act, as happened in <i>Gunn</i> and <i>Whitcomb</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More important, the majority ignores the \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable purposes\xe2\x80\x9d served by the longstanding rule requiring strict construction of \xc2\xa71253.  Not only does it comply with the congressional command to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98keep within narrow confines our appellate docket,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but without strict enforcement of the requirement that an order grant or deny an injunction, \xe2\x80\x9cit is simply not possible to know with any certainty what the court has decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gunn</i>, 399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 387\xe2\x80\x93388.  Such clarity \xe2\x80\x9cis absolutely vital in a case where a federal court is asked to nullify a law duly enacted by a sovereign State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 389.  Orders coming to this Court on direct appeal under the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule will more often than not lack that clarity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In these cases, for instance, what does the majority read the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of the orders to have been with respect to HD32 and HD34?  The District Court held that the challengers had \xe2\x80\x9cnot proven that \xc2\xa72 requires breaking the County Line Rule\xe2\x80\x9d in the Texas Constitution, Art.\xc2\xa0III, but that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa72 could require\xe2\x80\x9d drawing two majority-HCVAP[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>] districts.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 783, 795.  Does the majority read that to mean that the \xc2\xa72 results violation could potentially go without a remedy?  If so, there would have been no obstacle to use of the 2013 maps for those districts even after a remedial phase.  Or does the majority read that to mean that the challengers still had more to show before the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d redraw the districts that \xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9ccould\xe2\x80\x9d require to be redrawn?  And what is the effect of the conclusion respecting the County Line Rule on the potential remedy for the intentional vote dilution holding as to HD32 and HD34?  The majority conveniently avoids confronting this lack of clarity by ignoring the relevant record, instead stating without explanation that it believes \xe2\x80\x9cit clear that the District Court effectively enjoined use of these districts as currently configured.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 19, n.\xc2\xa015.  But it cannot escape the reality that its rule will \xe2\x80\x9cneedlessly complicate appellate review,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 15, given that \xe2\x80\x9cit is simply not possible [absent an injunction] to know with any certainty what the court has decided,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Gunn</i>, 399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I do not disagree that \xe2\x80\x9clack of specificity in an injunctive order would [not] alone deprive the Court of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 389, n.\xc2\xa04; see also <i>ante,</i> at 16 (quoting <i>Gunn</i>).  \xe2\x80\x9cBut the absence of any semblance of effort by the District Court to comply with [the specificity required of injunctive orders under the Federal Rules] makes clear that the court did not think its [orders] constituted an order granting an injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gunn</i>, 399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389.  If any doubt remained as to the effect of the orders here, moreover, the District Court explicitly assured the parties that, even though it had found violations, it was not enjoining use of the 2013 maps for the upcoming elections.  App. 134a\xe2\x80\x93136a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, it is axiomatic that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hertz Corp.</i> v. <i>Friend</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77, 94 (2010).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Judicial resources too are at stake [as] courts benefit from straightforward rules under which they can readily assure themselves of their power to hear a case.  Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predictability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Simple is thus the name of the game when it comes to jurisdictional rules.  The rule in the majority opinion is anything but.  Although the majority claims that a mere \xe2\x80\x9cfinding on liability cannot be appealed unless an injunction is granted or denied,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 20, the rule it embraces today makes it hard to understand when a finding on liability would not be read, as the majority does here, as having the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of an injunction.  It is a worrisome prospect that, after today, whenever a three-judge district court expresses that a statutory or constitutional violation must be remedied, the party held liable will straightaway file an appeal in this Court and assert jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71253, even where the district court is clear that no injunction has issued.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority opinion purports to add a limit by distinguishing between unappealable orders that find a plan \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful long before the next scheduled election\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cvery close to the election date,\xe2\x80\x9d and those (presumably) appealable orders that are entered neither \xe2\x80\x9clong before\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cvery close\xe2\x80\x9d to the next election.  <i>Ante,</i> at 20.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  What does that even mean?  The orders at issue here were entered about 15 months before the 2018 elections, and according to the majority fall within the not \xe2\x80\x9clong before\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cvery close\xe2\x80\x9d appealable range.  Why this is so, however, the majority never says.  Without any definitions for its boundary posts, courts will be left to wonder:  What about orders entered 17 or 18 months before an election?  Are those considered \xe2\x80\x9clong before\xe2\x80\x9d so they would be unappealable?  And are orders entered 14, 13, or 12 months before the election similarly unappealable because they were entered \xe2\x80\x9cvery close\xe2\x80\x9d to the election date?  And what does the majority mean by \xe2\x80\x9cthe election date\xe2\x80\x9d?  Does that include primaries?  What about registration deadlines, or ballot-printing deadlines?  It is not uncommon for there to be, at any given time, multiple impending deadlines relating to an upcoming election.  Thinking through the many variations of jurisdictional disputes that will arise over the years following this novel reading of \xc2\xa71253 should be enough to stop the majority from rewriting our long established jurisprudence in this area.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After today, our mandatory appellate docket will be flooded by unhappy litigants in three-judge district court cases, demanding our review.  Given the lack of predict- ability, the rule will incentivize appeals and \xe2\x80\x9cencourage gamesmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hertz Corp.</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94.  The Court will no doubt regret the day it opened its courthouse doors to such time-consuming and needless manipulation of its docket.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the majority were correct to import the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule into the \xc2\xa71253 context, moreover, that would still not justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s premature intervention in these appeals for at least two reasons.  First, while taking from <i>Carson</i> the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d rule it likes, the majority gives short shrift to the second half of that case, in which the Court was explicit that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might have a \xe2\x80\x98serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence,\xe2\x80\x99 and that the order can be \xe2\x80\x98effectually challenged\xe2\x80\x99 only by immediate appeal, the general congressional policy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 84.  Texas has made no showing of a \xe2\x80\x9cserious, perhaps irreparable consequence\xe2\x80\x9d requiring our immediate intervention, nor has Texas shown that the orders could not be \xe2\x80\x9ceffectually challenged\xe2\x80\x9d after the remedial stage was completed.  In fact, when Texas sought a stay of those orders before this Court, the 2018 elections were more than a year away.  For the majority, however, it is enough that the District Court found the Texas redistricting maps to be in violation of federal law.  <i>Ante,</i> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  That cursory application of <i>Carson</i>, in particular whether the injunctions the majority reads into the August 15 and 24 orders could be \xe2\x80\x9ceffectually challenged\xe2\x80\x9d absent immediate appeal to this Court, deprives that limit to our jurisdiction of much of its meaning when assessing Texas\xe2\x80\x99 request for our intervention in these cases.  Nothing in our precedent supports that truncated approach.  And in any event, if Texas wanted review of the orders after any injunction was entered by the District Court, it could have asked this Court for an emergency stay.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the August 15 and 24 orders at issue here sim- ply did not have the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of enjoining Texas\xe2\x80\x99 use of the 2013 maps.  The majority thinks otherwise in part because the District Court noted that the violations \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must be remedied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  In addition, the major- ity believes that \xe2\x80\x9cTexas had reason to fear that if it tried to  conduct elections under plans that the court had found to be \xe2\x80\x98racially discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x99 the court would infer an evil motive and perhaps subject the State once again to the strictures of preclearance under \xc2\xa73(c) of the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  But the majority forgets that the District Court made explicit that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough [it] found violations [in the 2013 maps], [it] ha[d] not enjoined [their] use for any upcoming elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 134a\xe2\x80\x93136a.  That the District Court requested the Texas attorney general to advise it, within \xe2\x80\x9cthree business days,\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature intends to take up redistricting in an effort to cure [the] violations,\xe2\x80\x9d 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 686; 267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 795, does not undermine that unequivocal statement.  Nothing in that language indicates that the District Court required the Legislature to \xe2\x80\x9credraw both maps <i>immediately</i>\xe2\x80\x9d or else \xe2\x80\x9cthe court would do so itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis in original).  Instead, recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthat the federal judiciary functions within a system of federalism which entrusts the responsibility of legislative .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. districting primarily to the state legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Whitcomb</i>, 305 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 1392, the District Court gave Texas an opportunity to involve its Legislature and asked for a simple statement of intent so that the court could manage its docket accordingly.  This request for a statement of intent, which was necessary for the District Court to manage its own docket, does not transform the orders into injunctions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to the second point, if Texas had any \xe2\x80\x9cfear\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the use of its maps, despite having been explicitly told that the maps were not enjoined, that would still not be enough.  This Court recognized in <i>Gunn</i> that the State in that case, faced with the order declaring its statute unconstitutional, \xe2\x80\x9cwould no doubt hesitate long before disregarding it.\xe2\x80\x9d  399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 390.  That hesitation was not enough in <i>Gunn</i> to magically transform an order into an injunction for purposes of \xc2\xa71253, and nothing about these cases justifies the majority taking out its wand today.  Whatever \xe2\x80\x9cfear\xe2\x80\x9d Texas had does not transform the August 15 and 24 orders into injunctions.  And absent an injunction, this Court lacks jurisdiction over these appeals.  The cases should thus be dismissed.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having rewritten the limits of \xc2\xa71253, the majority moves to the merits.  There again the Court goes astray.  It asserts that the District Court legally erred when it purportedly shifted the burden of proof and \xe2\x80\x9crequired the State to show that the 2013 Legislature somehow purged the \xe2\x80\x98taint\xe2\x80\x99 that the court attributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior legislature in 2011.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 21.  But that holding ignores the substantial amount of evidence of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory intent, and indulges Texas\xe2\x80\x99 warped reading of the legal analysis and factual record below.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Before delving into the content of the August 15 and 24 orders, a quick recap of the rather convoluted history of these cases is useful.  In 2011, the Texas Legislature redrew its electoral districts.  Various plaintiff groups challenged the 2011 maps under \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, and those lawsuits were consolidated before the three-judge District Court below pursuant to\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a).  Because Texas then was subject to preclearance under \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, the 2011 maps did not take effect immediately, and Texas filed a declaratory action in the District Court for the District of Columbia to obtain preclearance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cFaced with impending election deadlines and un-precleared plans that could not be used in the [2012] election, [the District] Court was faced with the \xe2\x80\x98unwelcome obligation\xe2\x80\x99 of implementing interim plans so that the primaries could proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 632.  In January 2012, this Court vacated the first iteration of those interim maps in <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Perez</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388, 394\xe2\x80\x93395 (2012) (<i>per curiam</i>), finding that the District Court failed to afford sufficient deference to the Legislature.  In February 2012, the District Court issued more deferential interim plans, but noted that its analysis had been expedited and curtailed, and that it had only made preliminary conclusions that might be revised on full consideration.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 367a\xe2\x80\x93424a; H.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 300a\xe2\x80\x93315a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In August 2012, the D.\xc2\xa0C.

It concluded that the federal congressional map had \xe2\x80\x9cretrogressive effect\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwas enacted with discriminatory intent,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 159, 161, and that the State House map was retrogressive and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe full record strongly suggests that the retrogressive effect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may not have been accidental,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 178.  Texas appealed, and the case was eventually dismissed following <i>Shelby County</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 529 (2013) (holding unconstitutional the formula used to subject States to the preclearance requirement).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In June 2013, the Texas Governor called a special legislative session, and that same month the Legislature adopted the 2012 interim maps as the permanent maps for the State.

In April and May 2017, the District Court held that districts in Texas\xe2\x80\x99 2011 maps violated \xc2\xa72 and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.

Two critical things are conspicuously missing from its analysis: first, consideration of the actual factual record (or most of it, anyway),[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>] and second, meaningful consideration of the limits of our review of facts on these appeals.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority first makes reference to the fact that the Texas attorney general \xe2\x80\x9cadvised the Legislature that the best way to [end the redistricting litigation] was to adopt the interim, court-issued plans,\xe2\x80\x9d a position repeated by the sponsor of the plans.  <i>Ante, </i>at 26.

In reaching those findings, however, the majority ignores all of the evidence in the record that demonstrates that the Legislature was aware of (and ignored) the infirmities in the maps, that it knew that adopting the interim plans would not resolve the litigation concerning the disputed districts, and that it nevertheless moved forward with the bills as a strategy to \xe2\x80\x9cinsulate\xe2\x80\x9d the discriminatory maps from further judicial scrutiny and perpetuate the discrimination embedded in the 2012 interim maps.

That of course ignores the evidence that the Legislature disregarded requests by the Texas attorney general, months earlier, to take up redistricting during the regular session, that proceeding through a special session permitted the Legislature to circumvent procedures that would have ensured full and adequate consideration, and that resources were not sufficiently allocated to permit considered review of the plans.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority sees nothing wrong with the fact that the Legislature failed \xe2\x80\x9cto take into account the problems with the 2011 plans that the D.\xc2\xa0C. court identified in denying preclearance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 30.

Rather, the evidence suggested that discriminatory motive permeated the entire 2011 redistricting process, as the D.\xc2\xa0C. court considered that \xe2\x80\x9cTexas has found itself in court every redistricting cycle [in the last four decades], and each time it has lost\xe2\x80\x9d; that \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and Hispanic members of Congress testified at trial that they were excluded completely from the process of drafting new maps, while the preferences of Anglo members were frequently solicited and honored\xe2\x80\x9d; that the redistricting committees \xe2\x80\x9creleased a joint congressional redistricting proposal for the public to view only after the start of a special legislative session, and each provided only seventy-two hours\xe2\x80\x99 notice before the sole public hearing on the proposed plan in each committee\xe2\x80\x9d; that minority members of the Texas Legislature \xe2\x80\x9craised concerns regarding their exclusion from the drafting process and their inability to influence the plan\xe2\x80\x9d; and that the Legislature departed from normal procedure in the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to release a redistricting proposal during the regular session, the limited time for review, and the failure to provide counsel with the necessary election data to evaluate [Voting Rights Act] compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  887 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 161.  The majority also ignores the findings of retrogression concerning the previous version of CD25, which of course are relevant to the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 claims about CD27 and CD35 in this litigation and were not addressed in the 2012 interim plans.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>infra</i>.  That the 2012 interim maps addressed some of the deficiencies identified by the D.\xc2\xa0C. court in the preclearance litigation does not mean that the Legislature in 2013 was free to wholly disregard the significance of other evidence of discrimination that tainted its 2011 maps and were entrenched in the 2012 interim maps.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even had the majority not ignored the factual record, it still would be wrong in concluding that the District Court erred in finding that the 2013 Legislature acted with the intent to further and benefit from the discrimination in the 2011 maps.

Therefore, the findings as to whether the 2013 Legislature engaged in a good-faith effort to address any known discrimination that tainted its 2011 plans were entirely apposite, so long as the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cweighed [this factor] together with any other direct and circumstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d bearing on the intent question, and so long as the burden remained on the challengers to establish invidious intent.  <i>Ante,</i> at 26.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority faults the District Court for not adequately engaging in that weighing and giving too \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d a focus to the historical factor in its intent analysis.  <i>Ante,</i> at 23; see also <i>ante,</i> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, n.\xc2\xa018.  That alleged \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d focus, the majority contends, led the District Court to shift the burden of proof on the intent inquiry away from the challengers, instead requiring Texas to show that the Legislature cured its past transgressions.  <i>Ante,</i> at 23.

The District Court was explicit that the challengers bore the burden to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish their claim by showing that the Legislature adopted the plans with a discriminatory purpose, maintained the district lines with a discriminatory purpose, or intentionally furthered preexisting intentional discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 646; see also <i>id.,</i> at 645 (discussing Circuit precedent regarding the showing needed for \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff [to] meet the purpose standard\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even when it does look at the actual language of the orders, the majority picks the few phrases that it believes support its argument, choosing to disregard the rest.

When read in full and in context, it is clear that the District Court remained focused on the evidence proving the intent of the 2013 Legislature to shield its plans from a remedy and thus further the discrimination, rather than simply presuming invidious intent from the failure to remove the taint, as the majority claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In selectively reviewing the record below, the majority attempts to shield itself from the otherwise unavoidable conclusion that the District Court did not err.

Before 2011, CD27 was a Latino opportunity district, <i>i.e., </i>a majority-HCVAP district with an opportunity to elect a Hispanic-preferred candidate.  When the Legislature reconfigured the district in 2013, it moved Nueces County, a majority-HCVAP county, into a new Anglo-majority district to protect an incumbent \xe2\x80\x9cwho was not the candidate of choice of those Latino voters\xe2\x80\x9d and likely would have been \xe2\x80\x9cousted\xe2\x80\x9d by them absent the redistricting.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 181a, 191a.  The District Court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cplacement of Nueces County Hispanics in an Anglo-majority district ensures that the Anglo majority usually will defeat the minority-preferred candidate, given the racially polarized voting in the area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 189a\xe2\x80\x93190a.  It also found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe political processes are not equally open to Hispanics\xe2\x80\x9d in Texas as a result of its \xe2\x80\x9chistory of official discrimination touching on the right of Hispanics to register, vote, and otherwise to participate in the democratic process [that] is well documented,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cLatinos bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education and employment/income, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 190a\xe2\x80\x93191a.  Given those findings, the District Court concluded that the newly constituted CD27 \xe2\x80\x9chas the effect of diluting Nueces County Hispanic voters\xe2\x80\x99 electoral opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 191a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Texas nevertheless contended (and maintains here) that no \xc2\xa72 results violation existed because only \xe2\x80\x9cseven compact Latino opportunity districts could be drawn in South/West Texas,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 181a, and that all seven districts already existed under its maps.  To explain how it counted to seven, Texas pointed to the creation of CD35 as a supposed new Latino opportunity district that joined Travis County Hispanics with Hispanics in San Antonio.  The District Court agreed that only seven such districts could be drawn in the area, but rejected Texas\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of CD35 as a defense.  The District Court concluded that because Travis County \xe2\x80\x9c[did] not have Anglo bloc voting,\xe2\x80\x9d 274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 683, \xc2\xa72 did not require the placement of Travis County Hispanics in an opportunity district, C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 176a; see also <i>Thornburg</i> v. <i>Gingles</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30, 51 (1986).  The District Court found that Texas had moved Travis County Hispanics from their pre-2011 district, CD25, to the newly constituted CD35, not to comply with \xc2\xa72, but \xe2\x80\x9cto use race as a tool for partisan goals .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to intentionally destroy an existing district with significant minority population (both African American and Hispanic) that consistently elected a Democrat (CD25).\xe2\x80\x9d  274 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 683.  Thus, it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCD35 was an impermissible racial gerrymander because race predominated in its creation without furthering a compelling state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Importantly, the District Court concluded that, without CD35, Texas could have drawn one more Latino opportunity district in South/West Texas that included Nueces County Hispanics.  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 181a; see also<i> id.,</i> at 190a (\xe2\x80\x9cPlaintiffs have thus shown that a district could be drawn in which Hispanics, including Nueces County Hispanics, are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority HCVAP\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 192a (\xe2\x80\x9cNumerous maps also demonstrated that accommodating the \xc2\xa72 rights of all or most Nueces County Hispanic voters would not compromise the \xc2\xa72 rights of any other voters, and in fact including it substantially accommodates the \xc2\xa72 rights of Hispanic voters in South/West Texas\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]lans were submitted during the legislative session and during this litigation that showed that seven compact districts could be drawn that included all or most Nueces County Hispanic voters but not Travis County voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 181a, n.\xc2\xa047.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nothing in the record or the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs suggests that the District Court clearly erred in these findings of fact, which unambiguously support its conclusion that there is a \xc2\xa72 results violation with respect to CD27.  Nevertheless, the majority offers two reasons for reversing that conclusion.  First, the majority contends that the District Court erred because \xe2\x80\x9cin evaluating the presence of majority bloc voting in CD35,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9clooked at only one, small part of the district, the portion that falls within Travis County.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 34.  It cites to <i>Bethune-Hill</i> v. <i>Virginia State Bd. of Elections</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12), an equal protection racial gerrymandering case, for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat redistricting analysis must take place at the district level.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 34.  According to the majority, then, the District Court should have looked at the existence of majority bloc voting in CD35 as a whole after the 2011 redistricting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the majority confuses the relevant inquiry, as well as the relevant timeline.  The particular \xc2\xa72 question here does not concern the status of Travis County Latinos in the newly constituted CD35 after the 2011 redistricting.  Rather, it concerns the status of Travis County Latinos in the old CD25, prior to the 2011 redistricting.  That is because the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa72 claim concerns the choices before the Legislature <i>at the time of the 2011 redistricting</i>, when it was deciding which Latinos in South/West Texas to place in the new opportunity district to be created in that area of the State.  The Legislature chose to include Travis County Latinos in an opportunity district at the expense of the Nueces County Latinos, who were instead moved into a majority-Anglo district.  So the question is whether, knowing that Nueces County Latinos indisputably had a \xc2\xa72 right, the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s choice was nevertheless justified because the Travis County Latinos also had a \xc2\xa72 right that needed to be accommodated.  In other words, did the Legislature actually create a new \xc2\xa72 opportunity district for persons with a \xc2\xa72 right, or did it simply move people without a \xc2\xa72 right into a new district and just call it an opportunity district?  To answer that question, the status of Travis County Latinos in 2011 is the only thing that matters, and the District Court thus correctly focused its inquiry on whether bloc voting existed in Travis County <i>prior</i> to the 2011 redistricting, such that Travis County Latinos could be found to have a \xc2\xa72 right.  Whether the newly constituted CD35 <i>now</i> qualifies as a \xc2\xa72 opportunity district\xe2\x80\x94an inquiry that would, as the majority suggests, call for district-wide consideration\xe2\x80\x94is beside the point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the majority reasons that \xe2\x80\x9cthe 2013 Legislature had \xe2\x80\x98good reasons\xe2\x80\x99 to believe that [CD35] was a viable Latino opportunity district that satisfied the <i>Gingles</i> factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 35.  For this, the majority cites to the fact that the district \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on a concept proposed by MALDEF\xe2\x80\x9d and that one group of plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cargued that the district [was] mandated by \xc2\xa72,\xe2\x80\x9d and vaguely suggests that, contrary to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is ample evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of majority bloc voting in CD35.  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority forgets, yet again, that we review factual findings for clear error.  <i>Harris</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  Indeed, its analysis is too cursory even for <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review.  The majority does not meaningfully engage with the full factual record below.  Instead, it looks only to the handful of favorable facts cited in Texas\xe2\x80\x99 briefs.  Compare Brief for Appellants 46 with <i>ante, </i>at 35.  Had the majority considered the full record, it could only have found that the District Court cited ample evidence in support of its conclusion that the Legislature had no basis for believing that \xc2\xa72 required its drawing of CD35.  In fact, the District Court noted that Texas in 2011 \xe2\x80\x9cactually asserted that CD35 is not required by \xc2\xa72,\xe2\x80\x9d C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. 174a, n.\xc2\xa040, that the main plan architect testified that he was not sure whether \xc2\xa72 required drawing the district, and that testimony at trial showed that the district was drawn because, on paper, it would fulfill the requirement of being majority-HCVAP while providing Democrats only one new district, and \xe2\x80\x9cnot because all of the <i>Gingles</i> factors were satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 178a\xe2\x80\x93179a, n. 45.  The District Court also concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence that any member of the Legislature .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had any basis in evidence for believing that CD35 was required by \xc2\xa72 other than its HCVAP-majority status.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Had the majority properly framed the inquiry and ap-plied the clear-error standard to the full factual record, it could not convincingly dispute the existence of a \xc2\xa72 results violation as to CD27.  Texas diluted the voting strength of Nueces County Latinos by transforming a minority-opportunity district into a majority-Anglo district.  The State cannot defend that result by pointing to CD35, because its \xe2\x80\x9ccreation of an opportunity district for [Travis County Latinos] without a \xc2\xa72 right offers no excuse for its failure to provide an opportunity district for [Nueces County Latinos] with a \xc2\xa72 right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399, 430 (2006) (<i>LULAC</i>).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I turn now to HD32 and HD34.  Before the 2011 redistricting, Nueces County had within it two Latino opportunity districts and part of one Anglo-represented district.  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 767.  Due to slower population growth reflected in the 2010 census, however, Nueces County was entitled to have within it only two districts.  Accordingly, during the 2011 redistricting, the Legislature opted to \xe2\x80\x9celiminate one of the Latino opportunity districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and draw two districts wholly within Nueces County\xe2\x80\x94one strongly Latino (HD34) and one a safe Anglo Republican seat (HD32) to protect [an] incumbent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cBased on an analysis of the <i>Gingles</i> requirements and the totality of the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the District Court found that the Legislature could have drawn two compact minority districts in Nueces County.  <i>Id.,</i> at 780.  Namely, the evidence demonstrated that it was possible to draw a map with \xe2\x80\x9ctwo districts with greater than 50% HCVAP,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cLatinos in Nueces County are highly cohesive, and that Anglos vote as a block usually to defeat minority preferred candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court then considered two proposed configurations for those districts: one with two HCVAP-majority districts located wholly within Nueces County, and another that required breaking the County Line Rule.  <i>Id.,</i> at 777.  The challengers preferred the latter configuration because, according to their expert, \xe2\x80\x9can exogenous election index\xe2\x80\x9d revealed that the two HCVAP-majority districts wholly within Nueces County did \xe2\x80\x9cnot perform suffi- ciently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 778.  The District Court did not accept that expert\xe2\x80\x99s assessment at face value.  Instead, it explained that \xe2\x80\x9can exogenous election index alone will not determine opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d and so evaluated the expert testing and ample other evidence and ultimately concluded that the challengers had \xe2\x80\x9cnot adequately demonstrated that they lack equal opportunity in [an alternative] configuration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such that a county line break is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 778, 781.  Thus, although it found that \xe2\x80\x9ctwo HCVAP-districts could have been drawn that would provide Hispanics with equal electoral opportunity, and that \xc2\xa72 could require those two districts,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xc2\xa72 did not require the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 requested remedy (<i>i.e., </i>breaking the County Line Rule), the District Court had to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider whether \xc2\xa72 requires a remedy\xe2\x80\x9d and directed the challengers to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider their preferred configuration for the remedy stage\xe2\x80\x9d that was to follow (before Texas prematurely appealed).  <i>Id.,</i> at 783.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority purports to accept these factual findings, and contends that they \xe2\x80\x9cshow that [HD32 and HD34] do not violate \xc2\xa72.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 35.  Specifically, the majority points to the fact that the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cown expert determined that it was not possible to divide Nueces County into more than one <i>performing</i> Latino district\xe2\x80\x9d without breaking the County Line Rule, a remedy the District Court concluded was not required by \xc2\xa72.  <i>Ante,</i> at 36 (emphasis in original).  \xe2\x80\x9cSo if Texas could <i>not</i> create two performing districts in Nueces County and did <i>not</i> have to break county lines,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority reasons, \xe2\x80\x9cthe logical result is that Texas did not dilute the Latino vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis in original).  In its view, a districting decision cannot be said to dilute the votes of minority voters \xe2\x80\x9cif the alternative to the districting decision at issue would not enhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At bottom, then, the majority rests its conclusion on one aspect of the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 expert evidence, <i>i.e., </i>that it was not possible to place within Nueces County more than one performing Latino district without breaking county lines.  The majority acknowledges the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the challengers had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98failed to show\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 that two majority-Latino districts in Nueces County would not perform,\xe2\x80\x9d but waves away that finding by concluding that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9ctwisted the burden of proof beyond recognition\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[ing] that a plaintiff might succeed on its \xc2\xa72 claim because its expert failed to show that the necessary factual basis for the claim could not be established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 37.  That conclusion is only possible because the majority closes its eyes to significant evidence in the record and misrepresents the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion about the potential for creating two performing Latino-majority districts in Nueces County.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority, of course, is right on one thing: The District Court recognized that the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 expert opined that the two HCVAP-majority districts would not perform based on the results of an exogenous election index.  See <i>ante,</i> at 36.  But the majority ignores that the District Court rejected that expert\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion because \xe2\x80\x9cthe results of an exogenous election index alone will not determine opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch indices often do not mirror endogenous election performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  267 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 778.  Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cjust relying on an exogenous election index to measure opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cconduct[ed] an intensely local appraisal to determine whether real electoral opportunity exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That \xe2\x80\x9cintensely local appraisal\xe2\x80\x9d resulted in a lengthy analysis that considered, among other facts: that Texas had a long \xe2\x80\x9chistory of voting-related discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d; that \xe2\x80\x9cracially polarized voting exist[s] in Nueces County and its house district elections, the level is high, and the high degree of Anglo bloc voting plays a role in the defeat of Hispanic candidates\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cthat Hispanics, including in Nueces County, suffer a \xe2\x80\x98continuing pattern of disadvantage\xe2\x80\x99 relative to non-Hispanics\xe2\x80\x9d; that population growth in the county \xe2\x80\x9cwas [driven by] Hispanic growth\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cHCVAP continues to climb\xe2\x80\x9d; that the districts \xe2\x80\x9cinclude demographic distributions strongly favoring Hispanic voters,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cnumbers translate into a significant advantage in house district elections\xe2\x80\x9d; and that data analysis showed that \xe2\x80\x9cperformance for Latinos increased significantly in presidential election years,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cindicates that the districts provide potential to elect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 778\xe2\x80\x93782.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the history of the county as well as its potential performance going forward was an important point of departure from the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 expert, who considered only the former.

The District Court also found the expert\xe2\x80\x99s analysis lacking in other key respects.

Instead of addressing what is evident from the 64-page hearing transcript, the majority fixates on the single fact that Representative Darby accepted an amendment for the redrawing of the new (racially gerrymandered) HD90, believing that this fact somehow erases or outweighs all the evidence in the record showing that Representative Darby was not interested in addressing concerns regarding the interim plans.  <i>Ante,</i> at 29\xe2\x80\x9330, and n.\xc2\xa024.
