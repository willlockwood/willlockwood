A nonmember had 30 days to object to full payment of dues but would still have to pay the chargeable portion.  The notice stated that the fee was subject to increase without further notice.  That same month, the Governor called for a special election on, inter alia, two ballot propositions opposed by the SEIU.  After the 30-day objection period ended, the SEIU sent a letter to unit employees announcing a temporary 25% increase in dues and a temporary elimination of the monthly dues cap, billing the move as an \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  The purpose of the fund was to help achieve the union\xe2\x80\x99s political objectives in the special election and in the upcoming November 2006 election.  The union noted that the fund would be used \xe2\x80\x9cfor a broad range of political expenses, including television and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in our communities across California.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nonunion employees were not given any choice as to whether they would pay into the fund.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners, on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into the fund, brought a class action against the SEIU alleging violation of their \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  The Federal District Court granted petitioners summary judgment.  Ruling that the special assessment was for entirely political purposes, it ordered the SEIU to send a new notice giving class members 45 days to object and to provide those who object a full refund of contributions to the fund.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Hudson prescribed a balancing test under which the proper inquiry is whether the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s procedures reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer, and the nonmember employees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld: \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0This case is not moot.  Although the SEIU offered a full refund to all class members after certiorari was granted, a live controversy remains.  The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because that conduct could be resumed as soon as the case is dismissed.  See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\xe2\x80\x99s Castle, Inc., \n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 283\n.  Since the SEIU continues to defend the fund\xe2\x80\x99s legality, it would not necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in the future.  Even if concerns about voluntary cessation were inapplicable because petitioners did not seek prospective relief, there would still be a live controversy as to the adequacy of the refund notice the SEIU sent pursuant to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.

Hartlage, \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 45\n\xe2\x88\x9253, which creates \xe2\x80\x9can open marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d in which differing ideas about political, economic, and social issues can compete freely for public acceptance without improper government interference, New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S 196, 202.  The government may not prohibit the dissemination of ideas it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement of ideas that it approves.  See, e.g., R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V. v. St. Paul, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n.  And the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.  See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609\n.  Closely related to compelled speech and compelled association is compelled funding of the speech of private speakers or groups.  Compulsory subsidies for private speech are thus subject to exacting \n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless, first, there is a comprehensive regulatory scheme involving a \xe2\x80\x9cmandated association\xe2\x80\x9d among those who are required to pay the subsidy, United States v. United Foods, Inc., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405\n, and, second, compulsory fees are levied only insofar as they are a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary incident\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9clarger regulatory purpose which justified the required association,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.

Railway Clerks, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435\n.  This form of compelled speech and association imposes a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant impingement on \n \nFirst Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d Ibid.  The justification for permitting a union to collect fees from nonmembers\xe2\x80\x94to prevent them from free-riding on the union\xe2\x80\x99s efforts\xe2\x80\x94is an anomaly.  Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers to opt out of paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues\xe2\x80\x95rather than exempting them unless they opt in\xe2\x80\x95represents a remarkable boon for unions, creating a risk that the fees nonmembers pay will be used to further political and ideological ends with which they do not agree.  Thus, Hudson, far from calling for a balancing of rights or interests, made it clear that any procedure for exacting fees from unwilling contributors must be \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully tailored to minimize the infringement\xe2\x80\x9d of free speech rights, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 302\n\xe2\x88\x92303, and it cited cases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or association must serve a compelling interest and must not be significantly broader than necessary to serve that interest.

Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers should not be required to fund a union\xe2\x80\x99s political and ideological projects unless they choose to do so after having \xe2\x80\x9ca fair opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to assess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities.  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 303.  The SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s procedure cannot be considered to have met Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  The SEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assessment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been given the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next annual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the following year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special assessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes.  But this decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice.  In any event, even a full refund would not undo the \n \nFirst Amendment violations, since the \n \nFirst Amendment does not permit a union to extract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later paid back in full.

They were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable, electoral uses.  And the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the assessment was a windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is unpersuasive.  First, the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the breadth of chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much reliance on its statistics.  \xe2\x80\x9cLobbying the electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d which the SEIU claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for supporting political causes and candidates.  Second, even if the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge objecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special assessment.  If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used for an upcoming year\xe2\x80\x99s chargeable purposes, there is a risk that unconsenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little.  That risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not at stake.  If the nonmembers pay too much, their \n \nFirst Amendment rights are infringed.  But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to receive any payment from those employees.

Thus, in Abood v.

And in Hudson, we identified procedural requirements that a union must meet in order to collect fees from nonmembers without violating their rights.  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 302\xe2\x80\x93311.  The \n \nFirst Amendment, we held, does not permit a public-sector union to adopt procedures that have the effect of requiring objecting nonmembers to lend the union money to be used for political, ideological, and other purposes not germane to collective bargaining.  Id., at 305.  In the interest of administrative convenience, however, we concluded that a union \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be faulted\xe2\x80\x9d for calculating the fee that nonmembers must pay \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of its expenses during the preceding year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 307, n.\xc2\xa018.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHudson concerned a union\xe2\x80\x99s regular annual fees.

The notice set monthly dues at 1% of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s gross monthly salary but capped monthly dues at $45.  Based on the most recently audited year, the SEIU estimated that 56.35% of its total expenditures in the coming year would be dedicated to chargeable collective-bargaining activities.  Thus, if a nonunion employee objected within 30 days to payment of the full amount of union dues, the objecting employee was required to pay only 56.35% of total dues.  The SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s notice also included a feature that was not present in Hudson: The notice stated that the agency fee was subject to increase at any time without further notice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDuring this time, the citizens of the State of California were engaged in a wide-ranging political debate regarding state budget deficits, and in particular the budget consequences of growing compensation for public employees backed by powerful public-sector unions.  On June 13, 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a special election to be held in November 2005, where voters would consider various ballot propositions aimed at state-level structural reforms.  Two of the most controversial issues on the ballot were Propositions 75 and 76.  Proposition 75 would have required unions to obtain employees\xe2\x80\x99 affirmative consent before charging them fees to be used for political purposes.  Proposition 76 would have limited state spending and would have given the Governor the ability under some circumstances to reduce state appropriations for public-employee compensation.  The SEIU joined a coalition of public-sector unions in vigorously opposing these measures.  Calling itself the \xe2\x80\x9cAlliance for a Better California,\xe2\x80\x9d the group would eventually raise \xe2\x80\x9cmore than $10 million, with almost all of it coming from public employee unions, including $2.75 million from state worker unions, $4.7 million from the California Teachers Association, and $700,000 from school workers unions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn July 30, shortly after the end of the 30-day objection period for the June Hudson notice, the SEIU proposed a temporary 25% increase in employee fees, which it billed as an \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Po- litical Fight-Back Fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 25.

Some of the class members had filed timely objections after receiving the regular Hudson notice in June, and others had not.  Those who had objected argued that it was wrong to require them to pay 56.35% of the temporary assessment, which had been billed as intended for use in making political expenditures that they found objectionable.  Those who had not objected after receiving the June Hudson notice contended that they should have received a new opportunity to object when the SEIU levied the special assessment for its Political Fight-Back Fund.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court granted summary judgment for the petitioners, finding that the union \xe2\x80\x9cfully intended to use the 12 million additional dollars it anticipated to raise for political purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  2008 WL 850128, *7.  \xe2\x80\x9cEven if every cent of the assessment was not intended to be used for entirely political purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cit is clear that the Union\xe2\x80\x99s intent was to depart drastically from its typical spending regime and to focus on activities that were political or ideological in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at *8.  In light of this fact, the court held that it would be inappropriate for the union to rely on previous annual expenditures to estimate that 56.35% of the new fee would go toward chargeable expenses.  The court ordered the SEIU to send out a new notice giving all class members 45 days to object and to provide those who objected with a full refund of their contributions to the Political Fight-Back Fund.

In opposing the petition for certiorari, the SEIU defended the decision below on the merits.  After certiorari was granted, however, the union sent out a notice offering a full refund to all class members, and the union then promptly moved for dismissal of the case on the ground of mootness.  Such postcertiorari maneuvers designed to insulate a decision from review by this Court must be viewed with a critical eye.  See City News &amp; Novelty, Inc. v.

United Foods, Inc., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405 (2001)\n, we considered the constitutionality of a state scheme that compelled such funding.  The subject of the speech at issue\xe2\x80\x94promoting the sale of mushrooms\xe2\x80\x94was not one that is likely to stir the passions of many, but the mundane commercial nature of that speech only highlights the importance of our analysis and our holding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act required that fresh mushroom handlers pay assessments used primarily to fund advertisements promoting mushroom sales.  A large producer objected to subsidizing these generic ads, and even though we applied the less demanding standard used in prior cases to judge laws affecting commercial speech, we held that the challenged scheme violated the \n \nFirst Amendment.  We made it clear that compulsory subsidies for private speech are subject to exacting \n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless two criteria are met.  First, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme involving a \xe2\x80\x9cmandated association\xe2\x80\x9d among those who are required to pay the subsidy.  Id., at 414.  Such situations are exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere, mandatory associations are permissible only when they serve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling state interes[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts, supra, at 623.  Second, even in the rare case where a mandatory association can be justified, compulsory fees can be levied only insofar as they are a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary incident\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9clarger regulatory purpose which justified the required association.\xe2\x80\x9d  United Foods, supra, at 414.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen a State establishes an \xe2\x80\x9cagency shop\xe2\x80\x9d that ex- acts compulsory union fees as a condition of public employment, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he dissenting employee is forced to support financially an organization with whose principles and demands he may disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellis, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 455. Because a public-sector union takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 48\xe2\x80\x9349, the compulsory fees constitute a form of compelled speech and association that imposes a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant impingement on \n \nFirst Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellis, supra, at 455.  Our cases to date have tolerated this \xe2\x80\x9cimpingement,\xe2\x80\x9d and we do not revisit today whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s former cases have given adequate recognition to the critical \n \nFirst Amendment rights at stake.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe primary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of permitting unions to collect fees from nonmembers, we have said, is \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent nonmembers from free-riding on the union\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, sharing the employment benefits obtained by the union\xe2\x80\x99s collective bargaining without sharing the costs incurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Davenport, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 181.  Such free-rider arguments, however, are generally insufficient to overcome First Amend- ment objections.  Consider the following examples:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf a community association engages in a clean-up campaign or opposes encroachments by industrial development, no one suggests that all residents or property owners who benefit be required to contribute.  If a parent-teacher association raises money for the school library, assessments are not levied on all parents.  If an association of university professors has as a major function bringing pressure on universities to observe standards of tenure and academic freedom, most professors would consider it an outrage to be required to join.  If a medical association lobbies against regulation of fees, not all doctors who share in the benefits share in the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAcceptance of the free-rider argument as a justification for compelling nonmembers to pay a portion of union dues represents something of an anomaly\xe2\x80\x94one that we have found to be justified by the interest in furthering \xe2\x80\x9clabor peace.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hudson, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 303.

Courts \xe2\x80\x9cdo not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 666, \n682 (1999)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Once it is recognized, as our cases have, that a nonmember cannot be forced to fund a union\xe2\x80\x99s political or ideological activities, what is the justification for putting the burden on the nonmember to opt out of making such a payment?  Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the default rule comport with the probable preferences of most nonmembers?  And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it likely that most employees who choose not to join the union that represents their bargaining unit prefer not to pay the full amount of union dues?  An opt-out system creates a risk that the fees paid by nonmembers will be used to further political and ideological ends with which they do not agree.  But a \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nion should not be permitted to exact a service fee from nonmembers without first establishing a procedure which will avoid the risk that their funds will be used, even temporarily, to finance ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hudson, supra, at 305 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the difference between opt-out and opt-in schemes is important, our prior cases have given sur-prisingly little attention to this distinction.  Indeed, acceptance of the opt-out approach appears to have come about more as a historical accident than through the careful application of \n \nFirst Amendment principles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trail begins with dicta in Street, where we considered whether a federal collective-bargaining statute authorized a union to impose compulsory fees for political activities.  367 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 774.  The plaintiffs were employees who had affirmatively objected to the way their fees were being used, and so we took that feature of the case for granted.  We held that the statute did not authorize the use of the objecting employees\xe2\x80\x99 fees for ideological purposes, and we stated in passing that \xe2\x80\x9cdissent is not to be presumed\xe2\x80\x94it must affirmatively be made known to the union by the dissenting employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In making that offhand remark, we did not pause to consider the broader constitutional implications of an affirmative opt-out requirement.  Nor did we explore the extent of \n \nFirst Amendment protection for employees who might not qual-ify as active \xe2\x80\x9cdissenters\xe2\x80\x9d but who would nonetheless prefer to keep their own money rather than subsidizing by default the political agenda of a state-favored union.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn later cases such as Abood and Hudson, we assumed without any focused analysis that the dicta from Street had authorized the opt-out requirement as a constitutional matter.  Thus in Hudson we did not take issue with the union\xe2\x80\x99s practice of giving employees annual notice and an opportunity to object to expected political expenditures.  At the same time, however, we made it clear that the procedures used by a union to collect money from nonmembers must satisfy a high standard.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the view of the Ninth Circuit panel major-ity, we did not call for a balancing of the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d of the union to collect an agency fee against the \n \nFirst Amendment rights of nonmembers.  628 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1119\xe2\x80\x931120. As we noted in Davenport, \xe2\x80\x9cunions have no constitutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 185.

And to underscore the meaning of this careful tailoring, we followed that statement with a citation to cases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or association must serve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d and must not be significantly broader than necessary to serve that interest.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy authorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers and permitting the use of an opt-out system for the collection of fees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the \n \nFirst Amendment can tolerate.  The SEIU, however, asks us to go farther.  It asks us to approve a procedure under which (a) a special assessment billed for use in electoral campaigns was assessed without providing a new opportunity for nonmembers to decide whether they wished to contribute to this effort and (b) nonmembers who previously opted out were nevertheless required to pay more than half of the special assessment even though the union had said that the purpose of the fund was to mount a political campaign and that it would not be used for ordinary union expenses.  This aggressive use of power by the SEIU to collect fees from nonmembers is indefensible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, we see no justification for the union\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide a fresh Hudson notice.  Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers should not be required to fund a union\xe2\x80\x99s political and ideological projects unless they choose to do so after having \xe2\x80\x9ca fair opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to assess the im- pact of paying for nonchargeable union activities.  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 303.  Giving employees only one opportunity per year to make this choice is tolerable if employees are able at the time in question to make an informed choice.  But a nonmember cannot make an informed choice about a special assessment or dues increase that is unknown when the annual notice is sent.  When a union levies a special assessment or raises dues as a result of unexpected developments, the factors influencing a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s choice may change.  In particular, a nonmember may take special exception to the uses for which the additional funds are sought.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe present case provides a striking example.  The special assessment in this case was billed for use in a broad electoral campaign designed to defeat two important and controversial ballot initiatives and to elect sympa- thetic candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial and legislative elections.  There were undoubtedly nonmembers who, for one reason or another, chose not to opt out or neglected to do so when the standard Hudson notice was sent but who took strong exception to the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s political objectives and did not want to subsidize those efforts.  These nonmembers might have favored one or both of the ballot initiatives; they might have wished to support the reelection of the incumbent Governor; or they might not have wanted to delegate to the union the authority to decide which candidates in the 2006 elections would receive a share of their money.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe effect on nonmembers was particularly striking with respect to the union\xe2\x80\x99s campaign against Proposition 75 because that initiative would have bolstered nonmember rights.  If Proposition 75 had passed, nonmembers would have been exempt from paying for the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s extensive political projects unless they affirmatively consented.  Thus, the effect of the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s procedure was to force many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort designed to restrict their own rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs Hudson held, procedures for collecting fees from nonmembers must be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on \n \nFirst Amendment rights, and the procedure used in this case cannot possibly be considered to have met that standard.  After the dues increase was adopted, the SEIU wrote to all employees in the relevant bargaining units to inform them of this development.  It would have been a relatively simple matter for the union to cast this letter in the form of a new Hudson notice, so that nonmembers could decide whether they wanted to pay for the union\xe2\x80\x99s electoral project.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe SEIU argues that we should not be troubled by its failure to provide a new notice because nonmembers who objected to the special assessment but were nonetheless required to pay it would have been given the chance to recover the funds in question by opting out when the next annual notice was sent.  If the special assessment was used entirely or in part for nonchargeable purposes, they suggest, the percentage of the union\xe2\x80\x99s annual expenditures for chargeable purposes would decrease, and therefore the amount of the dues payable by objecting nonmembers the following year would also decrease.  This decrease, how- ever, would not fully recompense nonmembers who did not opt out after receiving the regular notice but would have opted out if they had been permitted to do so when the special assessment was announced.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And in any event, even a full refund would not undo the violation of \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  As we have recognized, the \n \nFirst Amendment does not permit a union to extract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later paid back in full.  See Hudson, supra, at 305; Ellis, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444.  Here, for nonmembers who disagreed with the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s electoral objectives, a refund provided after the union\xe2\x80\x99s objectives had already been achieved would be cold comfort.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo respect the limits of the \n \nFirst Amendment, the union should have sent out a new notice allowing nonmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring them to opt out.  Our cases have tolerated a substantial impingement on \n \nFirst Amendment rights by allowing unions to impose an opt-out requirement at all.  Even if this burden can be justified during the collection of regular dues on an annual basis, there is no way to justify the additional burden of imposing yet another opt-out requirement to collect special fees whenever the union desires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of nonmembers who opted out when the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the \n \nFirst Amendment.  The SEIU required these employees to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, just as they had been required to pay 56.35% of the regular annual dues.  But the union proclaimed that the special assessment would be used to support an electoral campaign and would not be used for ordinary union expenses.  Accordingly, there is no reason to suppose that 56.35% of the new assessment was used for properly chargeable expenses.  On the contrary, if the union is to be taken at its word, virtually all of the money was slated for nonchargeable uses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe procedure accepted in Hudson is designed for use when a union sends out its regular annual dues notices.  The procedure is predicated on the assumption that a union\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of funds for chargeable and noncharge- able purposes is not likely to vary greatly from one year to the next.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  No such assumption is reasonable, however, when a union levies a special assessment or raises dues as a result of events that were not anticipated or disclosed at the time when a yearly Hudson notice was sent.  Accordingly, use of figures based on an audit of the union\xe2\x80\x99s operations during an entire previous year makes no sense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor would it be feasible to devise a new breakdown of chargeable and nonchargeable expenses for the special assessment.  Determining that breakdown is problematic enough when it is done on a regular annual basis because auditors typically do not make a legal determination as to whether particular expenditures are chargeable. Instead, the auditors take the union\xe2\x80\x99s characterization for granted and perform the simple accounting function of \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that the expenditures which the union claims it made for certain expenses were actually made for those expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d Andrews v. Education Assn. of Cheshire, 829 F.\xc2\xa02d 335, 340 (CA2 1987).  Thus, if a union takes a very broad view of what is chargeable\xe2\x80\x94if, for example, it believes that supporting sympathetic political candidates is chargeable and bases its classification on that view\xe2\x80\x94the auditors will classify these political expenditures as chargeable.  Objecting employees may then contest the union\xe2\x80\x99s chargeability determinations, but the onus is on the employees to come up with the resources to mount the legal challenge in a timely fashion.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 513; Jibson v. Michigan Ed. Assn., 30 F.\xc2\xa03d 723, 730 (CA6 1994).  This is already a significant burden for employees to bear simply to avoid having their money taken to subsidize speech with which they disagree, and the burden would become insupportable if unions could impose a new assessment at any time, with a new chargeability determination to be challenged.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe SEIU argues that objecting nonmembers who were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, far from subsidizing the union\xe2\x80\x99s political campaign, actually received a windfall.  According to the union\xe2\x80\x99s statistics, the actual percentage of regular dues and fees spent for chargeable purposes in 2005 turned out to be quite a bit higher (66.26%), and therefore, even if all of the money obtained through the special assessment is classified as nonchargeable, the union\xe2\x80\x99s total expenditures for 2005 were at least 66.26% chargeable.  See Brief for Respond- ent 5, n.\xc2\xa06.  This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the breadth of charge- able expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much reliance on its statistics.  In its brief, the SEIU argues broadly that all funds spent on \xe2\x80\x9clobbying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the electorate\xe2\x80\x9d are chargeable.  See id., at 51.  But \xe2\x80\x9clobbying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the electorate\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing but another term for supporting political causes and candidates, and we have never held that the \n \nFirst Amendment permits a union to compel nonmembers to support such political activities.  On the contrary, as long ago as Street, we noted the important difference between a union\xe2\x80\x99s authority to engage in collective bargaining and related activities on behalf of nonmember employees in a bargaining unit and the union\xe2\x80\x99s use of nonmembers\xe2\x80\x99 money \xe2\x80\x9cto support candidates for public office\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto support political causes which [they] oppos[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  367 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 768.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe sweep of the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s argument is highlighted by its discussion of the use of fees paid by objecting nonmembers to defeat Proposition 76.  According to the SEIU, these expenditures were \xe2\x80\x9cgermane\xe2\x80\x9d to the implementation of its contracts because, if Proposition 76 had passed, it would have \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively permitted the Governor to abrogate the Union\xe2\x80\x99s collective bargaining agreements under certain circumstances, undermining the Union\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its representation duty of negotiating effective collective bargaining agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf we were to accept this broad definition of germaneness, it would effectively eviscerate the limitation on the use of compulsory fees to support unions\xe2\x80\x99 controversial political activities.  Public-employee salaries, pensions, and other benefits constitute a substantial percentage of the budgets of many States and their subdivisions.  As a result, a broad array of ballot questions and campaigns for public office may be said to have an effect on present and future contracts between public-sector workers and their employers.  If the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cgermaneness\xe2\x80\x9d were as broad as the SEIU advocates, public-sector employees who do not endorse the unions\xe2\x80\x99 goals would be essentially unprotected against being compelled to subsidize political and ideological activities to which they object.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, even if the SEIU\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper for the union to charge objecting nonmembers 56.35%\xe2\x80\x94or any other particular per- centage\xe2\x80\x94of the special assessment.  Unless it is possible to determine in advance with some degree of accuracy the percentage of union funds that will be used during an upcoming year for chargeable purposes\xe2\x80\x94and the SEIU argues that this is not possible\xe2\x80\x94there is at least a risk that, at the end of the year, unconsenting nonmembers will have paid either too much or too little.  Which side should bear this risk?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe answer is obvious: the side whose constitutional rights are not at stake.  \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the existence of acceptable alternatives, [a] union cannot be allowed to commit dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 funds to improper uses even temporarily.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellis, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444.  Thus, if unconsenting nonmembers pay too much, their \n \nFirst Amendment rights are infringed.  On the other hand, if unconsenting nonmembers pay less than their proportionate share, no constitutional right of the union is violated because the union has no constitutional right to receive any payment from these employees.  See Davenport, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 185.  The union has simply lost for a few months the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d benefit of being em- powered to compel nonmembers to pay for services that they may not want and in any event have not agreed to fund.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we have noted, by allowing unions to collect any fees from nonmembers and by permitting unions to use opt-out rather than opt-in schemes when annual dues are billed, our cases have substantially impinged upon the \n \nFirst Amendment rights of nonmembers.  In the new situation presented here, we see no justification for any further impingement.  The general rule\xe2\x80\x94individuals should not be compelled to subsidize private groups or private speech\xe2\x80\x94should prevail.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPublic-sector unions have the right under the \n \nFirst Amendment to express their views on political and social issues without government interference.  See, e.g., Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010).  But employees who choose not to join a union have the same rights.  The \n \nFirst Amendment creates a forum in which all may seek, without hindrance or aid from the State, to move public opinion and achieve their political goals.  \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment values [would be] at serious risk if the government [could] compel a particular citizen, or a discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for speech on the side that [the government] favors.\xe2\x80\x9d  United Foods, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 411.  Therefore, when a public-sector union imposes a special assessment or dues increase, the union must provide a fresh Hudson notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Marinucci &amp; Wildermuth, Schwarzenegger Adds Prop. 75 to His Agenda, San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 18, 2005, p.\xc2\xa0A\xe2\x80\x9317.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Summers, Book Review, Sheldon Leader, Freedom of Association: A Study in Labor Law and Political Theory, 16 Comparative Labor L.

Our holding\xe2\x80\x94that this may be done only when the em-ployee affirmatively consents\xe2\x80\x94falls within that question.\nOur holding also addresses the primary remaining dispute between the parties, namely, the particular procedures that must be followed on remand in order to provide adequate assurance that members ofthe class are not compelled to subsidize nonchargeable activities to which they object.  See supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Petitioners argue strenuously that these procedures must be narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on their free-speech rights.  See Brief for Petitioners 11\xe2\x80\x9317.  We see no sensible way to address this dispute without confronting the question whether, in the particular context present here, an opt-out regime suffices.\nJustice Sotomayor would apparently have us proceed on the assumption that an opt-out regime is permitted.  She would then have us decide what sort of opt-out procedures would be sufficient if such a regime were allowed at all.  But that is a question that simply cannot be answered.  It would be like asking what sort of procedural requirements would be required if the government set out to do somethingelse that the \n  flatly prohibits\xe2\x80\x94for example, requiring prepublication approval of newspapers.\nThere is also no merit in Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s and Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s comments about prior precedent.  This case concerns the procedures that must be followed when a public-sector union announces a special assessment or mid-year dues increase.  No prior decision of this Court has addressed that question, and Hudson says not one word on the subject.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970500">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x931121\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tDIANNE KNOX, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

The majority thus decides, for the very first time, that the \n \nFirst Amendment does require an opt-in system in some circumstances: the levying of a special assessment or dues increase.

The union here followed a basic administrative system that ensures that the fee charged to objecting nonmembers matches their pro rata share of the union\xe2\x80\x99s chargeable expenditures, but it achieves that match only over a period of several years.  At the end of 2004, independent auditors determined the amount of chargeable (e.g., collective-bargaining related) expenditures and the amount of nonchargeable (e.g., non-germane political) expenditures that the union ac- tually made during 2004.  The union then used the resulting proportion (which was about 56% chargeable, 44% nonchargeable) as the basis for apportioning the next year\xe2\x80\x99s dues.  Thus in June 2005, the union sent all represented employees a Hudson notice setting forth that (roughly) 56 to 44 figure.  App. 96\xe2\x80\x93106.  It provided time for nonmembers to object or to challenge the figure or underlying data.  Id., at 98\xe2\x80\x93104.  And it then applied the resulting figure to determine the percentage of the total fee that objecting nonmembers would have to pay during the next fee-year, which ran from July 2005 to June 2006.  Id., at 102.  At the end of 2005, auditors again examined the union\xe2\x80\x99s actual expenditures made during 2005.  And the union then used those newly audited figures to determine the chargeable percentage for the fee-year 2006\xe2\x80\x932007.  Id., at 158.  Since political expenditures during calendar year 2005 turned out to be lower than in 2004, the new chargeable share amounted to about 69% of the total fee bill.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimplifying further to illustrate, I shall describe the system as (1) using audited accounts for Year One to determine the proportion of the fee that objectors must pay during Year Two, and (2) using audited accounts for Year Two to determine the proportion of the fee that ob-jectors must pay during Year Three.  If Year One\xe2\x80\x99s chargeable share (as applied to Year Two) turns out to be too high, Year Two\xe2\x80\x99s audited accounts will reflect that fact, and the payable share for Year Three will be reduced accordingly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis system does not put typical objectors to any dis-advantage.  If, say, in Year One total expenses were $1 million, collective-bargaining expenses amounted to $600,000, and political expenses amounted to $400,000, then the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more than 60% of normal dues in Year Two.  If in Year Two collective-bargaining expenses turned out to be a lesser share of total expenses, say 30%, then the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more than 30% of the total fee in Year Three.  Normally, what the objecting nonmembers lose on the swings they will gain on the roundabouts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis kind of basic administrative system is imperfect.  The nature of a union\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures, including nonchargeable political expenditures, varies from year to year, for political needs differ at different stages of political cycles.  Thus, last year\xe2\x80\x99s percentages will often fail to match this year\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures patterns.  And the possibility that an objecting nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s funds will temporarily help the union pay for a nonchargeable political expenditure (say, in Year Two) is always present\xe2\x80\x94though in this case that did not happen.  See infra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNonetheless this kind of system enjoys an offsetting administrative virtue.  It bases fees upon audited accounts, thereby avoiding the difficulties and disagreements that would surround an effort to determine the relevant proportions by  trying to measure union expenditures as they occur or by trying to make predictions about the nature of future expenditures.  It consequently gives workers reliable information.  It gives workers advance notice of next year\xe2\x80\x99s payable charge.  It gives nonmembers a \xe2\x80\x9creasonably prompt\xe2\x80\x9d opportunity to object.  Hudson, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310.  And, where the chargeable share of next year\xe2\x80\x99s expenses (Year Two) turns out to be lower than last year\xe2\x80\x99s (Year One), it provides offsetting compensation in the form of a lower payable share for the following year (Year Three).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, these features are characteristic of an administrative system that \xe2\x80\x9ccalculat[es]\xe2\x80\x9d shares of a union\xe2\x80\x99s fee \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of its expenses during the preceding year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 307, n.\xc2\xa018.  Hudson stated specifically that the \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nion cannot be faulted for calculating its fee\xe2\x80\x9d on that basis.  Ibid.

In my view, it did not violate the Constitution, and I shall explain my basis for thinking so by considering separately (1) those nonmembers who objected initially to the 2005 Hudson notice, and (2) those nonmembers who did not initially object.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe special assessment as administered here has worked no constitutional harm upon those nonunion employees who raised a general objection at the beginning of the year.  The union has honored their objections by subtracting from their special payments the same 44% that it subtracts from each of their ordinary monthly payments.  App. 309.  And we know that the special assessment here did not even work temporary constitutional harm.  That is because audited figures showed that the union\xe2\x80\x99s total nonchargeable (e.g., political) expenses for that year ended up as a lower percentage of total expenses than the pre-vious year.  Hence the objecting nonmembers ended up being charged too little, not too much, even with the special assessment thrown into the mix.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLet me put the point more specifically.  The union\xe2\x80\x99s June 2005 Hudson notice said that the union would charge objecting nonmembers roughly 56% of the dues paid by union members.  See App. 102.  That 56% figure represented the chargeable portion of expenditures according to the audited figures from 2004.  Thus, if the fee charged to a union member pursuant to the 2005 notice was $400, the fee charged to an objecting nonmember was $224.  The union similarly prorated the special assessment charging objecting nonmembers 56% of the assessment it imposed upon members.  Thus, if the special assessment amounted to $50 for a member, it amounted to $28 for an objecting nonmember.  And total dues in this example would have amounted to $450 for a member and $252 for a nonmember.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the event, the union\xe2\x80\x99s chargeable expenses for 2005\xe2\x80\x94including the funds raised pursuant to the special assessment\xe2\x80\x94amounted to more than 56% of its total expenditures.  The auditor\xe2\x80\x99s reports show that the union\xe2\x80\x99s total expenditures in 2005 amounted to $40,045,409.  Id., at 166.  Chargeable expenses amounted to $27,552,746, which works out to 69% of the total budget.  Ibid.  Thus, a substantially larger portion of the union\xe2\x80\x99s 2005 spending was chargeable (69%) than it had been in 2004 (56%).  Objecting nonmembers therefore paid 56% of normal fees, even though the chargeable share that year was 69%.  That is to say, they paid less than what the Constitution considers to be their fair share.  See Abood, 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236\xe2\x80\x93237.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven were the underlying facts different, I can find no constitutional basis for charging an objecting nonmember less than the 56% that the preceding year\xe2\x80\x99s audit showed was appropriate.  In general, any effort to send a new notice and then apply special percentages to a special midyear assessment fee runs into administrative difficulties that, as explained above, are avoided with a retrospective system.  See supra, at 6.  And, of course, requiring the use of some special proportion based on predicted expenditures would contradict Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s determination that prior year, not present year, expenditures can form the basis for the determination of that proportion.  See Hudson, supra, at 307, n.\xc2\xa018.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the particular example before us these general problems are camouflaged by the fact that the union itself said that the assessment was to be used for political purposes.  Hence it is tempting to say that 100% of the assessment is not chargeable.  But future cases are most unlikely to be so clear; disputes will arise over union predictions (say, that only 20% of the special assessment will be used for political purposes); and the Court will then perhaps understand the wisdom of Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  In any event, we have made clear in other cases that money is fungible.  Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 746, \n753 (1963)\n.  Whether a particular expenditure was funded by regular dues or the special assessment is \xe2\x80\x9cof bookkeeping significance only rather than a matter of real substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the announced purposes of the special assessment, rather than yearly expenditures taken as a whole, is beside the point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s response to these problems, particularly the administrative calculation problems, is apparently to de-part yet further from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier holdings.  It seems to say that an objector can withhold 100%, not simply of a special assessment made for political purposes, but of any special assessment whatsoever, including an assessment made solely for the purpose of paying for extra chargeable costs, such as extended contract negotiations, pension plan experts, or newly assessed contributions to replenish a national union\xe2\x80\x99s collective-bargaining assistance funds.  See ante, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Although this rule is comparatively simple to administer, it cannot be reconciled with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous constitutional holdings.  Abood, along with every related case the Court has ever decided, makes clear that the Constitution allows a union to assess nonmembers a pro rata share of fees insofar as they are used to pay for these kinds of collective-bargaining expenses.  See 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234\xe2\x80\x93236; see also Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507, \n524 (1991)\n; Machinists v.

It suggests that the basic Hudson administrative system gives the union the freedom to misclassify, arguing, for example, that the union has adopted an overly broad definition of charge-ability.  See ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  The 2005 proportion, however, rested upon audited 2004 accounts.  While petitioners argue in this Court that the union misclassified parts of the special assessment (which was not imposed until 2005), no brief filed in this case (and certainly no court below) has challenged the accuracy of the 2004 figures or the resulting chargeable/nonchargeable allocation.  Indeed, the 2004 accounts were audited before the special assessment at the center of this case was even imposed.  Compare App. 108 (reflecting that the audit of the 2004 budget was completed by April 25, 2005) with id., at 25 (reflecting approval of the special assessment on July 30, 2005).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore specifically, the Court suggests that the Consti-tution prohibits the union\xe2\x80\x99s classification of money spent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lobbying . . . the electorate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as a chargeable expense.  See ante, at 20.  But California state law explicitly permits the union to classify some lobbying expenses as charge-able.  See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73515.8 (West 2010) (a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s fair share includes \xe2\x80\x9cthe costs of support of lobbying activities designed to foster policy goals and collective negotiations and contract administration\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Lillebo v.

No one has attacked the constitutionality of California\xe2\x80\x99s law; no brief argues the question; and this Court does not normally find state laws unconstitutional without, at least, giving those who favor the law an opportunity to argue the matter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court further complains that the basic administrative system requires an objecting nonmember to \xe2\x80\x9ccome up with the resources to mount\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9clegal challenge\xe2\x80\x9d to the union\xe2\x80\x99s allocation \xe2\x80\x9cin a timely fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.  That concern too is misplaced.  The union has offered to pay for neutral arbitration of such disputes before the American Arbitration Association.  App. 103\xe2\x80\x93104.  And, again, insofar as the Court casts doubt on the constitutional validity of the basic system, the Court does so without the benefit of argument.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Court argues that (Step 1) Hudson is \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated on the assumption that a union\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of funds for chargeable and nonchargeable purposes is not likely to vary greatly from one year to the next,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18; that (Step 2) this assumption does not apply to midyear assessments; hence (Step 3) what appears binding precedent (namely Hudson) does not bind the Court in its interpretation of the Constitution as applied to those assessments.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI must jump this logical ship, however, at Step 1.  I cannot find in Hudson the \xe2\x80\x9cassumption\xe2\x80\x9d of uniform expenditures that the Court says underlies it.  The assumption does not appear there explicitly.  And it is hard to believe any such assumption could implicitly lurk within a case involving a union\xe2\x80\x99s political expenditures.  Those expenditures inevitably vary from political season to season.  They inevitably depend upon the number and kind of union-related matters currently visible on the political agenda.  Cf., e.g., App. 102, 158, 223 (union\xe2\x80\x99s chargeability proportion varies significantly over three years, from 56.35% in 2004, to 68.8% in 2005, to 60.3% in 2006).  And it is hard to believe that the Members of this Court, when deciding Abood, were not fully aware of these obvious facts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA stronger case can be made for allowing nonmember employees who did not object at the beginning of the dues year to object (for the first time) to a special assessment.  That is because, unlike the nonmember who objected initially, the union will not permit that initially nonobjecting nonmember to withhold anything from the special assessment fee.  Nonetheless, there are powerful reasons not to allow the nonmember who did not object initially to the annual fee to object now for the first time to the midyear special assessment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, insofar as a new objection permits the new objector to withhold only the portion of the fee that will pay for nonchargeable expenses (as the logic of the concurring Justices would suggest), the administrative problems that I earlier discussed apply.  See supra, at 6.  That is to say, unions, arbitrators, and courts will have to determine, on the basis of a prediction, how much of the special assessment the new objector can withhold.  I concede that many administrative problems could be overcome were the new objector allowed to withhold only the same 44% of the fee that the union here permitted ini- tial objectors to withhold (a figure based on 2004 au- dited accounts).  But no Member of the Court takes that approach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, as I have previously pointed out, the Court would permit nonmembers who did not object at the beginning of the year (like those who did then object) to object to (and to pay none of) every special assessment, including those made to raise money to pay additional collective-bargaining expenses.  This approach may avoid the uncertainty and resulting disputes inherent in an ef-fort to limit withholding to the nonchargeable portion of the fee.  But the price of avoiding those disputes is to reduce the financial contribution the union will receive even when a special assessment pays only for unexpected but perfectly legitimate collective-bargaining expenses.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, to provide a new opportunity to object requires providing for explanations, potential challenges, the development of separate accounts, and additional administrative procedures.  That means providing extra time and extra money.  By definition, however, special assessments are special; time may matter; and unlike the annual dues payment, the union is unlikely to be able to provide what is here a 6-month delay (between the close of the 2004 audited year and the beginning of the next mid-2005 dues year) that can be used to examine accounts and process objections.  In a word, a new opportunity to object means time, effort, and funds set aside to deal with a new layer of administrative procedure.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI recognize that allowing objections only once a year is only one possible way to administer a fee-charging system.  In principle, one might allow nonmembers to pose new objections to their dues payments biannually, or quarterly, or even once a month, as actual expenses do, or do not, correspond to initial union predictions.  But for constitutional purposes the critical fact is that annual objection is at least one reasonably practical way to permit the principled objector to avoid paying for politics with which he disagrees.  See Hudson, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 307, n. 18.  And that is so whether ordinary or special assessments are at stake.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, the nonmember who did not object initially is not likely to be a nonmember who strongly opposes the union\xe2\x80\x99s politics.  That many unions take political posi-tions and that they spend money seeking to advance those positions is not exactly a secret.  All those whom this union represents know from history that it spends money each year for nonchargeable purposes.  And any nonmember who has significant negative views about such matters is likely to have objected in advance.  Those who did not object initially (but do so later) likely include many whose objection rests, not upon constitutionally protected political grounds, but simply upon a desire not to pay a higher fee.  And those who withhold fees for that reason are not entitled to constitutional protection in doing so.  Here, the nonobjector cannot even claim that an increase in the total fee (by the amount of the special assessment) took him by surprise, for in its initial Hudson notice the union said that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ues are subject to change without further notice to fee payers.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 98.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, if the union will not let a nonmember object to a special assessment, that nonmember has an easy remedy.  He or she can simply object the first time around.  After all, the possibility of a special assessment is known in advance; the possibility that some, or all of it, will help the union make political expenditures is known in advance; the fact that the union will spend a significant amount of ordinary dues upon political matters is known in advance.  To obtain protection all a nonmember who believes he might object to some future political expenditure has to do is to object in advance.  His or her fees will decline from the beginning.  And, if the nonmember forgets to object, there is always next year\xe2\x80\x94when the chargeable amount of the fee will be based on this year\xe2\x80\x99s actual expenditures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven these considerations, I do not believe the \n \nFirst Amendment requires giving a second objection opportu-nity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also holds that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a public-sector union imposes a special assessment or dues increase,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cmay not exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  In other words, the Court mandates an \xe2\x80\x9copt-in\xe2\x80\x9d system in respect to the payment of special assessments.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion explains why the Court is wrong to impose this requirement.  See ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion concurring in judgment).  It runs directly contrary to precedent.  No party asked that we do so.  The matter has not been fully argued in this Court or in the courts below.  I agree with her about this matter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe decision is particularly unfortunate given the fact that each reason the Court offers in support of its \xe2\x80\x9copt-in\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion seems in logic to apply, not just to special assessments, but to ordinary yearly fee charges as well.  At least, its opinion can be so read.  And that fact virtually guarantees that the opinion will play a central role in an ongoing, intense political debate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe debate is generally about whether, the extent to which, and the circumstances under which a union that represents nonmembers in collective bargaining can require those nonmembers to help pay for the union\xe2\x80\x99s (constitutionally chargeable) collective-bargaining expenses.  Twenty-three States have enacted \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d laws, which, in effect, prevent unions from requiring nonmembers to pay any of those costs.  See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, State Right-to-Work Laws (Jan. 2009), online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/righttowork.htm (as visited June 18, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Other States have rejected the \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d approach and permit unions to require contributions from nonmembers, while protecting those nonmembers\xe2\x80\x99 right to opt out of supporting the union\xe2\x80\x99s political activities.  E.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73502.5(a), 3515.8.  Still others have enacted compromise laws that assume a nonmember does not wish to pay the nonchargeable portion of the fee unless he or she affirmatively indicates a desire to do so.  See Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa742.17A.500 (2010) (providing that a union cannot use a nonmember\xe2\x80\x99s agency fee for political purposes \xe2\x80\x9cunless affirmatively authorized by the individ-ual\xe2\x80\x9d).  The debate about public unions\xe2\x80\x99 collective-bargaining rights is currently intense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question of how a nonmember indicates a desire not to pay constitutes an important part of this debate.  Must the union assume that the nonmember does not intend to pay unless he affirmatively indicates his desire to pay, by \xe2\x80\x9copting in\xe2\x80\x9d?  Or, may the union assume that the nonmember is willing to pay unless the nonmember indicates a desire not to pay, by \xe2\x80\x9copting out\xe2\x80\x9d?  Where, as here, nonchargeable political expenses are at issue, there may be a significant number of represented nonmembers who do not feel strongly enough about the union\xe2\x80\x99s politics to indicate a choice either way.  That being so, an \xe2\x80\x9copt-in\xe2\x80\x9d requirement can reduce union revenues significantly, a matter of considerable importance to the union, while the additional protection it provides primarily helps only those who are politically near neutral.  See generally Sunstein &amp; Thaler, Libertarian Paternalism is not an Oxymoron, 70 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1159, 1161 (2003) (explaining that default rules play an important role when individuals do not have \xe2\x80\x9cwell-defined preferences\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consequently, the Court, which held recently that the Constitution permits a State to im-pose an opt-in requirement, see Davenport, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 185, has never said that it mandates such a requirement.  There is no good reason for the Court suddenly to enter the debate, much less now to decide that the Constitution resolves it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, principles of stare decisis are not absolute.  But the Court cannot be right when it departs from those principles without benefit of argument in a matter of such importance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
