CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the defendants in error sought to enjoin the collection of a judgment against their property to enforce an assessment under the drainage laws of Louisiana (1) because under the operation of the laws authorizing the judgment nothing more remained to be paid thereon, and (2) because the judgment had, in terms, been released and discharged by certain acts of the General Assembly of the state, passed in 1877 and 1878.  If the case was decided below on the first of these grounds no federal question is involved.</p>\n<p>It was settled long ago that, in cases coming to this Court from the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the opinion of the court below, as set out in the record, may be referred to, if necessary, to determine whether the judgment is one we have authority to review.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/281/case.html">Armstrong v.
