JUSTICE McLEAN delivered the opinion of court.</p>\n<p>This case was decided at the last term, on an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and a motion is now made by Mr. Rush, counsel for the appellee, for a reargument, on the ground that he was prevented by sickness from attending the Court at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p>It is a subject of regret that any cause should be heard in the absence of counsel, and especially where the cause of absence, by a failure in the mail, was unknown to the Court.</p>\n<p>In the above case, the brief of the counsel was before the Court, and it is not probable that an oral argument would have changed the result.</p>\n<p>But in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/20/58/case.html">Browder v.
