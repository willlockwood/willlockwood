Thus, a state drug offense must meet two conditions: It must \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d proscribe conduct that is an offense under the CSA, and the CSA must \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d prescribe felony punishment for that conduct.  Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is clearly a federal crime.  The question is whether Georgia law necessarily proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the CSA.  Title \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) provides that, with certain exceptions, a violation of the marijuana distribution statute is punishable by \xe2\x80\x9ca term of imprisonment of not more than 5 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, one of those exceptions, \xc2\xa7841(b)(4), provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany person who violates [the statute] by distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration shall be treated as\xe2\x80\x9d a simple drug possessor, i.e., as a misdemeanant.  These dovetailing provisions create two mutually exclusive categories of punishment for CSA marijuana distribution offenses: one a felony, the other not.  The fact of a conviction under Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s statute, standing alone, does not reveal whether either remuneration or more than a small amount was involved, so Moncrieffe\xe2\x80\x99s conviction could correspond to either the CSA felony or the CSA misdemeanor.  Thus, the conviction did not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d involve facts that correspond to an offense punishable as a felony under the CSA.

The Government contends that \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) is irrelevant because it is merely a mitigating sentencing factor, not an element of the offense.  But that understanding is inconsistent with Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, which recognized that when Congress has chosen to define the generic federal offense by reference to punishment, it may be necessary to take account of federal sentencing factors too.  The Government also asserts that any marijuana distribution conviction is presumptively a felony, but the CSA makes neither the felony nor the misdemeanor provision the default.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach would lead to the absurd result that a conviction under a statute that punishes misdemeanor conduct only, such as \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) itself, would nevertheless be a categorical aggravated felony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed remedy for this anomaly\xe2\x80\x94that noncitizens be given an opportunity during immigration proceedings to demonstrate that their predicate marijuana distribution convictions involved only a small amount of marijuana and no remuneration\xe2\x80\x94is inconsistent with both the INA\xe2\x80\x99s text and the categorical approach.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s procedure would require the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s overburdened immigration courts to conduct precisely the sort of post hoc investigation into the facts of predicate offenses long deemed undesirable, and would require uncounseled noncitizens to locate witnesses years after the fact.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the consequences of this decision are exaggerated.  Escaping aggravated felony treatment does not mean escaping deportation, because any marijuana distribution offense will still render a noncitizen deportable as a controlled substances offender.  Having been found not to be an aggravated felon, the noncitizen may seek relief from removal such as asylum or cancellation of removal, but the Attorney General may, in his discretion, deny relief if he finds that the noncitizen is actually a more serious drug trafficker.

The INA also prohibits the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief from removal to an aggravated felon, no matter how compelling his case.  Among the crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, and thus lead to these harsh consequences, are illicit drug trafficking offenses.  We must decide whether this category includes a state criminal statute that extends to the social sharing of a small amount of marijuana.

Ordinarily, when a noncitizen is found to be deportable on one of these grounds, he may ask the Attorney General for certain forms of discretionary relief from removal, like asylum (if he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his home country) and cancellation of removal (if, among other things, he has been lawfully present in the United States for a number of years).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158, 1229b.  But if a noncitizen has been convicted of one of a narrower set of crimes classified as \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felonies,\xe2\x80\x9d then he is not only deportable, \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), but also ineligible for these discretionary forms of relief.

Among them is \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  This general term is not defined, but the INA states that it \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[es] a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The chain of definitions ends with \xc2\xa73559(a)(5), which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d is an offense for which the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  The upshot is that a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s conviction of an offense that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment will be counted as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration purposes.

First, our cases have addressed state statutes that contain several different crimes, each described separately, and we have held that a court may determine which particular offense the noncitizen was convicted of by examining the charging document and jury instructions, or in the case of a guilty plea, the plea agreement, plea colloquy, or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some comparable judicial record\xe2\x80\x99 of the factual basis for the plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nijhawan, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 35 (quoting Shepard, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26).  Sec- ond, our focus on the minimum conduct criminalized by the state statute is not an invitation to apply \xe2\x80\x9clegal imagination\xe2\x80\x9d to the state offense; there must be \xe2\x80\x9ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 193.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis categorical approach has a long pedigree in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s immigration law.

In other words, to satisfy the categorical approach, a state drug offense must meet two conditions: It must \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d proscribe conduct that is an offense under the CSA, and the CSA must \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d prescribe felony punishment for that conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoncrieffe was convicted under a Georgia statute that makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cpossess, have under [one\xe2\x80\x99s] control, manufacture, deliver, distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell, or possess with intent to distribute mari- juana.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ga.

But one of the exceptions is important here.  Paragraph (4) provides, \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, any person who violates subsection (a) of this section by distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration shall be treated as\xe2\x80\x9d a simple drug possessor, \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844, which for our purposes means as a misdemeanant.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  These dovetailing provisions create two mutually exclusive categories of punishment for CSA marijuana distribution offenses: one a felony, and one not.  The only way to know whether a marijuana distribution offense is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable as a felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the CSA, Lopez, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 60, is to know whether the conditions described in paragraph (4) are present or absent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA conviction under the same Georgia statute for \xe2\x80\x9csell[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d marijuana, for example, would seem to establish remuneration.  The presence of remuneration would mean that paragraph (4) is not implicated, and thus that the conviction is necessarily for conduct punishable as a felony under the CSA (under paragraph (1)(D)).  In contrast, the fact of a conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, standing alone, does not reveal whether either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana was involved.  It is possible neither was; we know that Georgia prosecutes this offense when a defendant possesses only a small amount of marijuana, see, e.g., Taylor v. State, 260 Ga. App. 890, 581 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 386, 388 (2003) (6.6 grams), and that \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution\xe2\x80\x9d does not require remuneration, see, e.g., Hadden v. State, 181 Ga. App. 628, 628\xe2\x80\x93629, 353 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 532, 533\xe2\x80\x93534 (1987).  So Moncrieffe\xe2\x80\x99s conviction could correspond to either the CSA felony or the CSA misdemeanor.  Ambiguity on this point means that the conviction did not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d involve facts that correspond to an offense punishable as a felony under the CSA.  Under the categorical approach, then, Moncrieffe was not convicted of an aggravated felony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government advances a different approach that leads to a different result.  In its view, \xc2\xa7841(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanor provision is irrelevant to the categorical analysis because paragraph (4) is merely a \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating exception,\xe2\x80\x9d to the CSA offense, not one of the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense.  Brief for Respondent 12.  And because possession with intent to distribute marijuana is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptive[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d a felony under the CSA, the Government asserts, any state offense with the same elements is presumptively an aggravated felony.  Id., at 37.  These two contentions are related, and we reject both of them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the Government reads our cases to hold that the categorical approach is concerned only with the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of an offense, so \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) \xe2\x80\x9cis not relevant\xe2\x80\x9d to the categorical analysis.  Id., at 20.  It is enough to satisfy the categorical inquiry, the Government suggests, that the \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of Moncrieffe\xe2\x80\x99s Georgia offense are the same as those of the CSA offense: (1) possession (2) of marijuana (a controlled substance), (3) with intent to distribute it.  But that understanding is inconsistent with Carachuri-Rosendo, our only decision to address both \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  There we recognized that when Congress has chosen to define the generic federal offense by reference to punishment, it may be necessary to take account of federal sentencing factors too.  See 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  In that case the relevant CSA offense was simple possession, which \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes a \xe2\x80\x98felony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x99 only because the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes additional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).  We therefore called the generic federal offense \xe2\x80\x9crecidivist simple possession,\xe2\x80\x9d even though such a crime is not actually \xe2\x80\x9ca separate offense\xe2\x80\x9d under the CSA, but rather an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98amalgam\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of offense elements and sentencing factors.

Here, the facts giving rise to the CSA offense establish a crime that may be either a felony or a misdemeanor, depending upon the presence or absence of certain factors that are not themselves elements of the crime.  And so to qualify as an aggravated felony, a conviction for the predicate offense must necessarily establish those factors as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government attempts to distinguish Carachuri-Rosendo on the ground that the sentencing factor there was a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating exception that turned a misdemeanor into a felony, whereas here \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) is a narrow mitigation exception that turns a felony into a misdemeanor.  Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9343.  This argument hinges upon the Government\xe2\x80\x99s second assertion: that any marijuana distribution conviction is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptively\xe2\x80\x9d a felony.  But that is simply incorrect, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument collapses as a result.  Marijuana distribution is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor until we know whether the conditions in paragraph (4) attach: Section 841(b)(1)(D) makes the crime punishable by five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as provided\xe2\x80\x9d in paragraph (4), and \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) makes it punishable as a misdemeanor \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding paragraph (1)(D)\xe2\x80\x9d when only \xe2\x80\x9ca small amount of marihuana for no remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d is involved.  (Emphasis added.)  The CSA\xe2\x80\x99s text makes neither provision the default.  Rather, each is drafted to be exclusive of the other.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike the BIA and the Fifth Circuit, the Government believes the felony provision to be the default because, in practice, that is how federal criminal prosecutions for marijuana distribution operate.

It is true that every Court of Appeals to have considered the question has held that a defendant is eligible for a 5-year sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) if the Government proves he possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute it, and that the Government need not negate the \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) factors in each case.  See, e.g., United States v. Outen, 286 F.\xc2\xa03d 622, 636\xe2\x80\x93639 (CA2 2002) (describing \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) as a \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating exception\xe2\x80\x9d); United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.\xc2\xa03d 666, 670\xe2\x80\x93671 (CA4 2003) (collecting cases).  Instead, the burden is on the defendant to show that he qualifies for the lesser sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).

The Court of Appeals cases the Government cites distinguished between elements and sentencing factors to determine which facts must be proved to a jury, in light of the \n \nSixth Amendment concerns addressed in Apprendi v. New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466 (2000)\n.

But those concerns do not apply in this context.  Here we consider a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d federal offense in the abstract, not an actual federal offense being prosecuted before a jury.  Our concern is only which facts the CSA relies upon to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors, not which facts must be found by a jury as opposed to a judge, nor who has the burden of proving which facts in a federal prosecution.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause of these differences, we made clear in Carachuri-Rosendo that, for purposes of the INA, a generic fed- eral offense may be defined by reference to both \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98elements\xe2\x80\x99 in the traditional sense\xe2\x80\x9d and sentencing factors.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa03, ___ (slip op., at 3, n.\xc2\xa03, 7); see also id., at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (describing the generic federal offense there as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Controlled Substances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factors\xe2\x80\x9d did not exist when Congress added illicit drug trafficking to the list of aggravated felonies, Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, \n\n102Stat.\n4469\xe2\x80\x934470, and most courts at the time understood both \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) and \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) to contain sentencing factors that draw the line between a felony and a misdemeanor.  See, e.g., United States v. Campuzano, 905 F.\xc2\xa02d 677, 679 (CA2 1990).

Penal Law Ann. \xc2\xa7221.35 (West 2008) (emphasis added).  This statute criminalizes only the distribution of a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration, and so all convictions under the statute would fit within the CSA misdemeanor provision, \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).  But the Government would categorically deem a conviction under this statute to be an aggravated felony, because the statute contains the corresponding \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d of (1) distributing (2) marijuana, and the Government believes all marijuana distribution offenses are punishable as felonies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same anomaly would result in the case of a noncitizen convicted of a misdemeanor in federal court under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a) and (b)(4) directly.  Even in that case, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s logic, we would need to treat the federal misdemeanor conviction as an aggravated felony, because the conviction establishes elements of an offense that is presumptively a felony.  This cannot be.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot imagine that Congress took the trouble to incorporate its own statutory scheme of felonies and misdemeanors,\xe2\x80\x9d only to have courts presume felony treatment and ignore the very factors that distinguish felonies from misdemeanors.

Dec. 698, 702 (2012), and endorsed by Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, post, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis solution is entirely inconsistent with both the INA\xe2\x80\x99s text and the categorical approach.  As noted, the relevant INA provisions ask what the noncitizen was \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of,\xe2\x80\x9d not what he did, and the inquiry in immigration proceedings is limited accordingly.  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3); see Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The Government cites no statutory authority for such case-specific factfinding in immigration court, and none is apparent in the INA.  Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s main categorical argument would seem to preclude this inquiry: If the Government were correct that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact of a marijuana-distribution conviction alone constitutes a CSA felony,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 37, then all marijuana distribution convictions would categorically be convictions of the drug trafficking aggravated felony, mandatory deportation would follow under the statute, and there would be no room for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s follow-on factfinding procedure.  The Government cannot have it both ways.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the procedure the Government envisions would require precisely the sort of post\xc2\xa0hoc investigation into the facts of predicate offenses that we have long deemed undesirable.  The categorical approach serves \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d purposes: It promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.  Chambers v. United States, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122, \n125 (2009)\n; see also Mylius, 210 F., at 862\xe2\x80\x93863.  Yet the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach would have our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s overburdened immigration courts entertain and weigh testimony from, for example, the friend of a noncitizen who may have shared a marijuana cigarette with him at a party, or the local police officer who recalls to the contrary that cash traded hands.  And, as a result, two noncitizens, each \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of\xe2\x80\x9d the same offense, might obtain different aggravated felony determinations depending on what evidence remains available or how it is perceived by an individual immigration judge.  The categorical approach was designed to avoid this \xe2\x80\x9cpotential unfairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601; see also Mylius, 210 F., at 863.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, the minitrials the Government proposes would be possible only if the noncitizen could locate witnesses years after the fact, notwithstanding that during removal proceedings noncitizens are not guaranteed legal representation and are often subject to mandatory detention, \xc2\xa71226(c)(1)(B), where they have little ability to collect evidence.  See Katzmann, The Legal Profession and the Unmet Needs of the Immigrant Poor, 21 Geo. J.

A noncitizen in removal proceedings is not at all similarly situated to a defendant in a federal criminal prosecution.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures could readily be replicated in immigration proceedings is therefore misplaced.  Cf. Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315) (rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that procedures governing determination of the recidivism sentencing factor could \xe2\x80\x9cbe satisfied during the immigration proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government defends its proposed immigration court proceedings as \xe2\x80\x9ca subsequent step outside the categorical approach in light of Section 841(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98circumstance-specific\xe2\x80\x99 nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 37.  This argument rests upon Nijhawan, in which we considered another aggravated felony, \xe2\x80\x9can offense that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i).  We held that the $10,000 threshold was not to be applied categorically as a required component of a generic offense, but instead called for a \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance-specific approach\xe2\x80\x9d that allows for an examination, in immigration court, of the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular circumstances in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nijhawan, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38\xe2\x80\x9340.  The Government suggests the \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) factors are like the monetary threshold, and thus similarly amenable to a circumstance-specific inquiry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe explained in Nijhawan, however, that unlike the provision there, \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric crim[e]\xe2\x80\x9d to which the categorical approach applies, not a circumstance-specific provision.  Id., at 37; see also Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa011 (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n.\xc2\xa011).  That distinction is evident in the structure of the INA.  The monetary threshold is a limitation, written into the INA itself, on the scope of the aggravated felony for fraud.  And the monetary threshold is set off by the words \xe2\x80\x9cin which,\xe2\x80\x9d which calls for a circumstance-specific examination of \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct involved \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99 the commission of the offense of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nijhawan, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 39.  Locating this exception in the INA proper suggests an intent to have the relevant facts found in immigration proceedings.  But where, as here, the INA incorporates other criminal statutes wholesale, we have held it \xe2\x80\x9cmust refer to generic crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d to which the categorical approach applies.  Id., at 37.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government suggests that the immigration court\xe2\x80\x99s task would not be so daunting in some cases, such as those in which a noncitizen was convicted under the New York statute previously discussed or convicted directly under \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).  True, in those cases, the record of conviction might reveal on its face that the predicate offense was punishable only as a misdemeanor.  But most States do not have stand-alone offenses for the social sharing of marijuana, so minitrials concerning convictions from the other States, such as Georgia, would be inevitable.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Government suggests that even in these other States, the record of conviction may often address the \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) factors, because noncitizens \xe2\x80\x9cwill be advised of the immigration consequences of a conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d as defense counsel is required to do under Padilla v. Kentucky, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359 (2010)\n, and as a result counsel can build an appropriate record when the facts are fresh.  Brief for Respondent 38.  Even assuming defense counsel \xe2\x80\x9cwill\xe2\x80\x9d do something simply because it is required of effective counsel (an assumption experience does not always bear out), this argument is unavailing because there is no reason to believe that state courts will regularly or uniformly admit evidence going to facts, such as remuneration, that are irrelevant to the offense charged.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, to avoid the absurd consequences that would flow from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s narrow understanding of the categorical approach, the Government proposes a solution that largely undermines the categorical approach.  That the only cure is worse than the disease suggests the Government is simply wrong.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government fears the consequences of our decision, but its concerns are exaggerated.  The Government observes that, like Georgia, about half the States criminalize marijuana distribution through statutes that do not require remuneration or any minimum quantity of mari- juana.  Id., at 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  As a result, the Government contends, noncitizens convicted of marijuana distribution offenses in those States will avoid \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d determinations, purely because their convictions do not resolve whether their offenses involved federal felony conduct or misdemeanor conduct, even though many (if not most) prosecutions involve either remuneration or larger amounts of marijuana (or both).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEscaping aggravated felony treatment does not mean escaping deportation, though.  It means only avoiding mandatory removal.  See Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Any marijuana distribution offense, even a misdemeanor, will still render a noncitizen deportable as a controlled substances offender.  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  At that point, having been found not to be an aggravated felon, the noncitizen may seek relief from removal such as asylum or cancellation of removal, assuming he satisfies the other eligibility criteria.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158(b), 1229b(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  But those forms of relief are discretionary.  The Attorney General may, in his discretion, deny relief if he finds that the noncitizen is actually a member of one \xe2\x80\x9cof the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous drug cartels,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 2 (opinion of Alito, J.), just as he may deny relief if he concludes the negative equities outweigh the positive equities of the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s case for other reasons.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that our rejection of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad understanding of the scope of \xe2\x80\x98aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x99 may have any practical effect on policing our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders, it is a limited one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, serious drug traffickers may be adjudi- cated aggravated felons regardless, because they will likely be convicted under greater \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking\xe2\x80\x9d offenses that necessarily establish that more than a small amount of marijuana was involved.  See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x9331(c)(1) (Supp. 2012) (separate provision for trafficking in more than 10 pounds of marijuana).  Of course, some offenders\xe2\x80\x99 conduct will fall between \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) conduct and the more serious conduct required to trigger a \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking\xe2\x80\x9d statute.  Brief for Respondent 30.  Those offenders may avoid aggravated felony status by operation of the categorical approach.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s objection to that underinclusive result is little more than an attack on the categorical approach itself.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We prefer this degree of imperfection to the heavy burden of relitigating old prosecutions.  See supra, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  And we err on the side of underinclusiveness because ambiguity in criminal statutes referenced by the INA must be construed in the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  See Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); Leocal v. Ashcroft, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, n.\xc2\xa08 (2004).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government suggests that our holding will frustrate the enforcement of other aggravated felony provisions, like \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(C), which refers to a federal firearms statute that contains an exception for \xe2\x80\x9cantique firearm[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(3).  The Government fears that a conviction under any state firearms law that lacks such an exception will be deemed to fail the categorical inquiry.  But Duenas-Alvarez requires that there be \xe2\x80\x9ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 193.  To defeat the categorical comparison in this manner, a non- citizen would have to demonstrate that the State actu- ally prosecutes the relevant offense in cases involving an- tique firearms.  Further, the Government points to \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(P), which makes passport fraud an aggravated felony, except when the noncitizen shows he committed the offense to assist an immediate family member.  But that exception is provided in the INA itself.  As we held in Nijhawan, a circumstance-specific inquiry would apply to that provision, so it is not comparable.  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is the third time in seven years that we have considered whether the Government has properly characterized a low-level drug offense as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Once again we hold that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach defies \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98commonsense conception\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of these terms.  Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Lopez, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 53).  Sharing a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration, let alone possession with intent to do so, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not fit easily into the \xe2\x80\x98everyday understanding\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinarily .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. means some sort of commercial dealing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Lopez, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 53\xe2\x80\x9354).  Nor is it sensible that a state statute that criminalizes conduct that the CSA treats as a misde- meanor should be designated an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  We hold that it may not be.  If a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for a marijuana distribution offense fails to establish that the offense involved either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana, the conviction is not for an aggravated felony under the INA.

Yet that is the longstanding, natural result of the categorical approach, which focuses not on the criminal conduct a defendant \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[s],\xe2\x80\x9d but rather what facts are necessarily established by a conviction for the state offense.  Different state offenses will necessarily establish different facts.  Some will track the \xe2\x80\x9cuni-form\xe2\x80\x9d federal definition of the generic offense, and some will not.  Taylor v.

There, the defendant was convicted of a state felony, but his offense would have been a misdemeanor under the CSA.  Id., at 53.  The Court held that the offense did not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98felony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because it was not \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable as a felony under that federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 60 (quoting \xc2\xa7924(c)(2); emphasis added).  I dissented in Lopez and warned that an inquiry into whether a state offense would constitute a felony in a hypothetical federal prosecution would cause \xe2\x80\x9csignificant inconsistencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 63.  I explained that one such inconsistency would arise if an alien defendant never convicted of an actual state felony were subject to deportation based on a hypothetical federal prosecution.

Instead of following the logic of Lopez, however, the Court contorted the law to avoid the harsh result compelled by that decision.  In Carachuri-Rosendo, the defendant was convicted of a crime that the State categorized as a misdemeanor, but his offense would have been a felony under the CSA because he had a prior conviction.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at ___).  The Court held that the offense did not constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d because the state prosecutor had not charged the existence of a prior conviction and, thus, the defendant was not \xe2\x80\x9cactually convicted of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Concurring in the judgment, I explained that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was inconsistent with Lopez because the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was punishable as a felony under the CSA, but that Lopez was wrongly decided and that a proper reading of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) supported the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction was a state-law misdemeanor and, as a result, it did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA].\xe2\x80\x9d  See ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI declined to apply Lopez in Carachuri-Rosendo, and I am unwilling to apply it here.  Indeed, the Court itself declined to follow the logic of Lopez to its natural end in Carachuri-Rosendo.  And, now the majority\xe2\x80\x99s ill-advised approach once again leads to an anomalous result.  It is undisputed that, for federal sentencing purposes, Moncrieffe\xe2\x80\x99s offense would constitute a federal felony unless he could prove that he distributed only a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration.  Cf. United States v. Outen, 286 F.\xc2\xa03d 622, 637\xe2\x80\x93639 (CA2 2002) (Sotomayor, J.) (agreeing with the Government that \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) is a mitigating exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cdefault provision\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) and that it need not negate the \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) factors to support a sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D)).  But, the Court holds that, for purposes of the INA, Moncrieffe\xe2\x80\x99s offense would necessarily correspond to a federal misdemeanor, regardless of whether he could in fact prove that he distributed only a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration.  Ante, at 11 (asserting that neither \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) nor \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) is the \xe2\x80\x9cdefault\xe2\x80\x9d provision).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, thus, has the effect of treating a substantial number of state felonies as federal misdemeanors, even when they would result in federal felony convictions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority notes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his is the third time in seven years that we have considered whether the Government has properly characterized a low-level drug offense as .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an \xe2\x80\x98aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  The Court has brought this upon itself.  The only principle uniting Lopez, Carachuri-Rosendo, and the decision today appears to be that the Government consistently loses.  If the Court continues to disregard the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), I expect that these types of cases will endlessly\xe2\x80\x94and needlessly\xe2\x80\x94recur.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Section 16\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x9331(c) (Supp. 2012) increases the punishment for trafficking in marijuana, while \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x932(b) (2011) decreases the punishment for simple possession of 1 ounce or less of marijuana.

Aliens convicted of especially serious crimes, however, are ineligible for cancellation of removal.  \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3) (2006 ed.).

In those States, even if an alien is convicted of possessing tons of marijuana with the intent to distribute, the alien is eligible to remain in this country.  Large-scale marijuana distribution is a major source of income for some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous drug cartels, Dept. of Justice, National Drug Intelligence Center, National Drug Threat Assessment 2, 7 (2011), but the Court now holds that an alien convicted of participating in such activity may petition to remain in this country.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision also means that the consequences of a conviction for illegal possession with intent to distribute will vary radically depending on the State in which the case is prosecuted.  Consider, for example, an alien who is arrested near the Georgia-Florida border in possession of a large supply of marijuana.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, if the alien is prosecuted and convicted in Georgia for possession with intent to distribute, he is eligible for cancellation of removal.  But if instead he is caught on the Florida side of the line and is convicted in a Florida court\xe2\x80\x94where possession with intent to distribute a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration is covered by a separate statutory provision, compare Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7893.13(3) (2010) with \xc2\xa7893.13(1)(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94the alien is likely to be ineligible.

In analyzing the relevant INA provisions, the starting point is \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), which provides that a lawful permanent resident alien subject to removal may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal if he has not been convicted of any \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cillicit tracking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)]).\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  And this latter provision defines a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. 801 et\xc2\xa0seq.).\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  Thus \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhere an alien has a prior federal conviction, it is a straightforward matter to determine whether the conviction was for a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA].\xe2\x80\x9d  But \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) introduces a complication.  That provision states that the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggra-vated felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9capplies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  As noted, the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d includes a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA],\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B) makes it necessary to determine what is meant by a state \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d that is a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) obviously contemplates is that the BIA or a court will identify conduct associated with the state offense and then determine whether that conduct would have supported a qualifying conviction under the federal CSA.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Identifying and evaluating this relevant conduct is the question that confounds the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Before turning to that question, however, some preliminary principles should be established.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Lopez v. Gonzales, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47, \n50 (2006)\n, we held that felony status is controlled by federal, not state, law.  As a result, once the relevant conduct is identified, it must be determined whether proof of that conduct would support a felony conviction under the CSA.  The federal definition of a felony is a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73559(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  Consequently, if the proof of the relevant conduct would support a conviction under the CSA for which the maximum term of imprisonment is more than one year, the state conviction qualifies as a conviction for an \xe2\x80\x9caggra-vated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis brings us to the central question presented in this case: how to determine and evaluate the conduct that constitutes the state \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  One possibility is that ac-tual conduct is irrelevant, and that only the elements of the state crime for which the alien was convicted matter.  We have called this the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor v. United States, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, \n600 (1990)\n, and we have generally used this approach in determining whether a state conviction falls within a federal definition of a crime, see id., at 600\xe2\x80\x93601 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 924(e)(2)(B)(i) defines \xe2\x80\x98violent felony\xe2\x80\x99 as any crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year that \xe2\x80\x98has as an element\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94not any crime that, in a particular case, involves\xe2\x80\x94the use or threat of force.  Read in this context, the phrase \xe2\x80\x98is burglary\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) most likely refers to the elements of the statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  But, as will be discussed below, we have also departed in important ways from a pure categorical approach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case conveys the impression that its analysis is based on the categorical approach, but that is simply not so.  On the contrary, a pure categorical approach leads very quickly to the conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Georgia conviction was a conviction for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe elements of the Georgia offense were as follows: knowledge, possession of marijuana, and the intent to dis-tribute it.  Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x9330(j)(1) (2007); Jack- son v. State, 295 Ga. App. 427, 435, n.\xc2\xa028, 671 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 902, 909, n.\xc2\xa028 (2009).  Proof of those elements would be sufficient to support a conviction under \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a), and the maximum punishment for that offense is imprisonment for up to five years, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V), more than enough to qualify for felony treatment.  Thus, under a pure categorical approach, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Georgia conviction would qualify as a conviction for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d and would render him ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court departs from this analysis because \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) provides a means by which a defendant convicted of violating \xc2\xa7841(a) (2006 ed.) may lower the maximum term of imprisonment to no more than one year.  That provision states that \xe2\x80\x9cany person who violates [\xc2\xa7841(a)] by distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration shall be treated as\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant convicted of simple possession, and a defendant convicted of that lesser offense faces a maximum punishment of one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment (provided that the defendant does not have a prior simple possession conviction), \xc2\xa7844 (2006 ed., Supp. V).  Reading this provision together with \xc2\xa7841(a), the Court proceeds as if the CSA created a two-tiered possession-with-intent-to-distribute offense: a base offense that is punishable as a misdemeanor and a second-tier offense (possession with intent to distribute more than a \xe2\x80\x9csmall amount\xe2\x80\x9d of mari-juana or possession with intent to distribute for remuneration) that is punishable as a felony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the CSA actually created such a two-tiered offense, the pure categorical approach would lead to the conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Georgia conviction was not for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The elements of the Georgia offense would not suffice to prove the second-tier offense, which would require proof that petitioner possessed more than a \xe2\x80\x9csmall amount\xe2\x80\x9d of marijuana or that he intended to obtain remuneration for its distribution.  Instead, proof of the elements of the Georgia crime would merely  estab- lish a violation of the base offense, which would be a misdemeanor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe CSA, however, does not contain any such two-tiered provision.  And \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) does not alter the elements of the \xc2\xa7841(a) offense.  As the Court notes, every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that \xc2\xa7841(a) is the default offense and that \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) is only a mitigating sentencing guideline, see United States v. Outen, 286 F.\xc2\xa03d 622, 636\xe2\x80\x93639 (CA2 2002) (Sotomayor, J.) (describing \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) as a \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating exception\xe2\x80\x9d); United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.\xc2\xa03d 666, 670 (CA4 2003) (collecting cases), and the Court does not disagree, ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConfirmation of this interpretation is provided by the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9csmall amount\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).  If \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) had been meant to alter the elements of \xc2\xa7841(a), Congress surely would not have used such a vague term.  Due process requires that the elements of a criminal statute be defined with specificity.  Connally v. General Constr. Co., \n\n269 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, \n393 (1926)\n.  Accordingly, it is apparent that \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) does not modify the elements of \xc2\xa7841(a) but instead constitutes what is in essence a mandatory sentencing guideline.  Under this provision, if a defendant is convicted of violating \xc2\xa7841(a), the defendant may attempt to prove that he possessed only a \xe2\x80\x9csmall amount\xe2\x80\x9d of marijuana and that he did not intend to obtain remuneration for its distribution.  If the defendant succeeds in convincing the sentencing judge, the maximum term of imprisonment is lowered to one year.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, contrary to the impression that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion seeks to convey, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis does not follow the pure categorical approach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis supported by prior case law. The Court claims that its approach follows from our decision in Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010), but that case\xe2\x80\x94unlike the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94faithfully ap-plied the pure categorical approach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Carachuri-Rosendo, the alien had been convicted in a Texas court for simple possession of a controlled substance.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  At the time of that conviction, Carachuri-Rosendo had a prior state conviction for simple possession, but this fact was not charged or proved at his trial and was apparently not taken into account in setting his sentence, which was 10 days in jail.  Id., at ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Arguing that Carachuri-Rosendo was ineligible for cancellation of removal, the Government maintained that his second sim-ple possession conviction qualified under the INA as a conviction for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  This was so, the Government contended, because, if Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s second simple-possession prosecution had been held in federal court, he could have been punished by a sentence of up to two years due to his prior simple possession conviction.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis more severe sentence, however, would have required the federal prosecutor to file a formal charge alleging the prior conviction; Carachuri-Rosendo would have been given the opportunity to defend against that charge; and the heightened sentence could not have been imposed unless the court found that the prior conviction had occurred.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur rejection of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument thus represented a straightforward application of the pure categorical approach.  The elements of the Texas offense for which Carachuri-Rosendo was convicted were knowledge or intent, possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, and nothing more.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481.117(a), (b) (West 2010).  Proof of a prior simple possession conviction was not required, and no such proof appears to have been offered.  The maximum penalty that could have been imposed under federal law for simple possession (without proof of a prior simple possession conviction) was one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment.  Thus, proof in federal court of the elements of the Texas offense would not have permitted a felony-length sentence, and consequently the state conviction did not qualify as a felony punishable under the CSA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnsupported by either the categorical approach or our prior cases, the decision of the Court rests instead on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief\xe2\x80\x94which I share\xe2\x80\x94that the application of the pure categorical approach in this case would lead to results that Congress surely did not intend.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSuppose that an alien who is found to possess two marijuana cigarettes is convicted in a state court for possession with intent to distribute based on evidence that he in-tended to give one of the cigarettes to a friend.  Under the pure categorical approach, this alien would be regarded as having committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this classification is plainly out of step with the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the severity of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime because under the CSA the alien could obtain treatment as a misdemeanant by taking advantage of \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor this reason, I agree with the Court that such an alien should not be treated as having committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  In order to avoid this result, however, it is necessary to depart from the categorical approach, and that is what the Court has done.  But the particular way in which the Court has departed has little to recommend it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is analytically confused.  As already discussed, the Court treats \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) as if it modified the elements of \xc2\xa7841(a), when in fact \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) does no such thing.  And the Court obviously knows this because it does not suggest that \xc2\xa7841(b)(4) changes the elements of \xc2\xa7841(a) for criminal law purposes.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach leads to the strange and disruptive results noted at the beginning of this opinion.  As an initial matter, it leads to major drug traffick-ing crimes in about half the States being excluded from the category of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, it leads to significant disparities between equally culpable defendants.  We adopted the categorical ap-proach to avoid disparities in our treatment of defendants convicted in different States for committing the same criminal conduct.  See Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 590\xe2\x80\x93591 (rejecting the view that state law determined the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat would mean that a person convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm would, or would not, receive a sentence enhancement based on exactly the same conduct, depending on whether the State of his prior conviction happened to call that conduct \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet the Court reintroduces significant disparity into our treatment of drug offenders.  All of this can be avoided by candidly acknowledging that the categorical approach is not the be-all and end-all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen Congress wishes to make federal law dependent on certain prior state convictions, it faces a difficult task.  The INA provisions discussed above confront this problem, and their clear objective is to identify categories of criminal conduct that evidence such a high degree of societal danger that an alien found to have engaged in such conduct should not be allowed to obtain permission to remain in this country.  Since the vast majority of crimes are prosecuted in the state courts, Congress naturally looked to state, as well as federal, convictions as a metric for identifying these dangerous aliens.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut state criminal codes vary widely, and some state crimes are defined so broadly that they encompass both very serious and much less serious cases.  In cases involving such state provisions, a pure categorical approach may frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has said that the categorical approach finds support in the term \xe2\x80\x9cconviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Taylor, supra, at 600; Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, \n19 (2005)\n.  But the Court has never held that a pure categorical approach is dictated by the use of that term,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and I do not think that it is.  In ordinary speech, when it is said that a person was convicted of or for doing something, the \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d may include facts that go beyond the bare elements of the relevant criminal offense.  For example, it might be said that an art thief was convicted of or for stealing a Rembrandt oil painting even though neither the identity of the artist nor the medium used in the painting are elements of the standard offense of larceny.  See 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa719.1(a) (2d ed. 2003).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, departures from the categorical approach are warranted, and this Court has already sanctioned such departures in several circumstances.  See Taylor, supra, at 602 (modified categorical approach); Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183, \n193 (2007)\n (categorical approach does not exclude state-law convictions unless there is \xe2\x80\x9ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d); Nijhawan v. Holder, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29, \n32 (2009)\n (interpreting an enumerated \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d in \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) not to be a generic crime).  Consistent with the flexibility that the Court has already recognized, I would hold that the categorical approach is not controlling where the state conviction at issue was based on a state statute that encompasses both a substantial number of cases that qualify under the federal standard and a substantial number that do not.  In such situations, it is appropriate to look beyond the elements of the state offense and to rely as well on facts that were admitted in state court or that, taking a realistic view, were clearly proved.  Such a look beyond the elements is particularly appropriate in a case like this, which involves a civil proceeding before an expert agency that regularly undertakes factual inquiries far more daunting than any that would be involved here.  See, e.g., Negusie v. Holder, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 511 (2009)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying this approach in the present case, what we find is that the Georgia statute under which petitioner was convicted broadly encompasses both relatively minor offenses (possession of a small amount of marijuana with the intent to share) and serious crimes (possession with intent to distribute large amounts of marijuana in exchange for millions of dollars of profit).  We also find that petitioner had the opportunity before the BIA to show that his criminal conduct fell into the category of relatively minor offenses carved out by \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).  Administrative Record 16\xe2\x80\x9326.  The BIA takes the entirely sensible view that an alien who is convicted for possession with intent to distribute may show that his conviction was not for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d by proving that his conduct fell within \xc2\xa7841(b)(4).  Matter of Castro-Rodriguez, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 698, 701\xe2\x80\x93702 (2012).  Petitioner, for whatever reason, availed himself only of the opportunity to show that his conviction had involved a small amount of marijuana and did not present evidence\xe2\x80\x94or even contend\xe2\x80\x94that his offense had not involved remuneration.  Administrative Record 16\xe2\x80\x9326, 37.  As a result, I think we have no alternative but to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which in turn affirmed the BIA.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlien\xe2\x80\x9d is the term used in the relevant provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and this term does not encompass all noncitizens.

In reject-ing what it referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d the Carachuri-Rosendo Court was addressing an entirely different question, specifi-cally, which set of conduct is relevant.

But, as discussed above, see n.\xc2\xa02, supra, just because the categorical approach does not require conjecture as to whether a hypothetical federal prosecutor would be likely to charge and prove a prior conviction does not mean that it also precludes analysis of the structure of the federal criminal statute at hand.  Indeed, our categorical-approach cases have done little else.
