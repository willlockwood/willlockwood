Shore\'s Executors</em> in two circumstances -- first that this is the case of a seizure of goods for an asserted forfeiture, and secondly that before the proceedings <em>in rem</em> were consummated by a sentence, the collector who made the seizure was removed from office.  In our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 17 U. S. 76</a></p><p> judgment, neither of these facts affords any ground to except this case from the principles which were established in <em>Jones v. Shore\'s Executors.</em>  It was there expressly held that the collector acquired an inchoate right by the seizure which, by the subsequent decree of condemnation, gives him an absolute vested title to his share in the forfeiture.  Without overturning the doctrine of that case, the present is not susceptible to argument, and we therefore unanimously affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
