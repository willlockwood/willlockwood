The Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance would not violate the provision, calculating the debt limitation based on the appraised value of property in Guam.  Agreeing, the Supreme Court rejected the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s argument to base the limitation on assessed value.  The Ninth Circuit granted the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition, but while the appeal was pending, Congress removed the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over appeals from Guam.  Relying on its holding in <em>Santos</em> v. <em>Guam</em>, that Congress had stripped it of jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court dismissed the appeal.  The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, even though it was more than 90 days after the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment did not become final, for purposes of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review, until the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing the appeal.

In some cases, the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judgment by \xe2\x80\x9crais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised that possibility and thus suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Until the Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.  Contrary to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the judgment was not made final either when Congress enacted the jurisdiction-depriving statute or when the Ninth Circuit decided <em>Santos.</em>  This holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances here.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Guam\xe2\x80\x99s debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed valuation of property in the Territory.  The term \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.  It therefore means \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term consistently defined as a valuation of property for tax purposes.  Appraised value is simply market value, which may or may not relate to taxation.  The Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d limits the kinds of property qualifying for inclusion in the debt-limitation calculation\xe2\x80\x94impermissibly rearranges the statutory language.  \xe2\x80\x9cTax\xe2\x80\x9d modifies \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.  The court also erred in reasoning that, because the Virgin Islands\xe2\x80\x99 debt-limitation provision explicitly refers to \xe2\x80\x9cassessed value,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress must have intended to base Guam\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on some other value.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of \xe2\x80\x9cassessed\xe2\x80\x9d says no more than its rejection of \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cappraised,\xe2\x80\x9d terms it could have used had it meant actual, market, or appraised value.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation comports with most States\xe2\x80\x99 practice of fixing the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valuation.  States use clear language when departing from this approach, but Congress has not done so here.  The Governor\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments\xe2\x80\x94that this interpretation would result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value, and that this Court owes deference to the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Organic Act\xe2\x80\x94are not persuasive.

CAMACHO,\nGOVERNOR OF GUAM</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of guam</p>\n<p align="left">[March 27, 2007]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Legislature of Guam authorized Guam\xe2\x80\x99s Governor to issue bonds to fund the Territory\xe2\x80\x99s continuing obligations.  Concluding that the bonds would violate the debt-limitation provision of the Organic Act of Guam, \xc2\xa711, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71423a, the attorney general[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] of Guam refused to sign contracts necessary to issue the bonds.  In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the bonds would not violate the Organic Act\xe2\x80\x99s debt limitation.  The Guam Supreme Court held that \xc2\xa71423a limits Guam\xe2\x80\x99s allowed indebtedness to 10 percent of the appraised valuation, not the assessed valuation, of taxable property in Guam.  We granted certiorari to decide whether Guam\xe2\x80\x99s debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed or the appraised valuation of property in Guam.  We hold that it must be calculated based on the assessed valuation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, Guam lacked sufficient revenues to pay its obligations.  To supplement revenues, the Guam Legislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds worth approximately $400 million.  See Guam Pub. L. 27\xe2\x80\x93019.  The Governor signed the new legislation and prepared to issue the bonds.  However, under Guam law, Guam\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general must review and approve all government contracts prior to their execution.  Guam Code Ann., Tit. 5, \xc2\xa722601 (1996).  The attorney general concluded that issuance of the bonds would raise the Territory\xe2\x80\x99s debt above the level authorized by Guam\xe2\x80\x99s Organic Act.  See 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71423a (prohibiting debt \xe2\x80\x9cin excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam\xe2\x80\x9d).  He therefore refused to approve the bond contracts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the authorized bonds would not cause Guam\xe2\x80\x99s debt to exceed the debt limitation.  That determination turned, in part, on the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caggregate tax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d in Guam\xe2\x80\x99s Organic Act.  The attorney general calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the assessed valuation of property in Guam.  But the Governor calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the appraised valuation.  Because Guam assesses property at 35 percent of its appraised value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \xc2\xa724102(f), the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation resulted in a much lower debt limit.  The Guam Supreme Court agreed with the Governor and held that 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71423a sets the debt limitation at 10 percent of the appraised valuation of property in Guam.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorney general filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  See \xc2\xa71424\xe2\x80\x932 (granting Ninth Circuit jurisdiction over appeals from Guam).  The Court of Appeals granted the petition in October 2003.  While the appeal was pending, Congress amended \xc2\xa71424\xe2\x80\x932 and removed the language that vested jurisdiction in the Ninth Circuit over appeals from Guam.  See \xc2\xa72, 118 Stat. 2208, 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71424\xe2\x80\x932 (West Supp. 2006).  In <em>Santos</em> v. <em>Guam</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa03d 1051 (Jan. 3, 2006), the Court of Appeals addressed the effect of the amendment on its jurisdiction.  The court held that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction not only prospectively, but also for pending appeals.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1054.  Citing <em>Santos</em>, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s appeal in this case on March 6, 2006.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.  By statute, certiorari petitions must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 90 days after the entry of \xe2\x80\xa6 judgment\xe2\x80\x9d in a lower court.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72101(c).  The attorney general filed his petition more than 90 days after the judgment from which he appeals\xe2\x80\x94that of the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94was entered.  Accordingly, when we granted certiorari in this case, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), we directed the parties to address both the question presented by petitioner and whether the filing of a petition for certiorari or the pendency of a writ of certiorari before the Court of Appeals suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment for purposes of the 90-day period set out in \xc2\xa72101(c).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only \xe2\x80\x9ca genuinely final judgment\xe2\x80\x9d will trigger \xc2\xa72101(c)\xe2\x80\x99s 90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari in this Court.  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a>, 98 (2004).  In most cases, the 90-day period begins to run immediately upon entry of a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  In some cases, though, the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judgment and thereby reset the 90-day \xe2\x80\x9cclock.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  For instance, the timely filing of a petition for rehearing with the lower court or a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate decision to rehear an appeal may suspend the finality of a judgment by \xe2\x80\x9crais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/33/index.html">495 U. S. 33</a>, 46 (1990)).  So long as that question remains open, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there is no \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d to be reviewed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hibbs, supra,</em> at 98 (quoting <em>Jenkins, supra</em>, at 46), and \xc2\xa72101(c)\xe2\x80\x99s 90-day period does not run.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same reasoning applies here.  In 2003, the Court of Appeals appropriately exercised discretionary jurisdiction over the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  See 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71424\xe2\x80\x932.  By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised the possibility that it might \xe2\x80\x9cmodify the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9calter the parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 98.  Thus, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 grant of certiorari suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and prevented the 90-day clock from running while the case was pending before the Court of Appeals.  And until the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governor argues that the judgment was made final earlier\xe2\x80\x94either when Congress enacted the statute depriving the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction or when the Court of Appeals decided in <em>Santos</em> that the statute applied to pending cases.  But when Congress removed the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over appeals from Guam, it did not dismiss this appeal.  Likewise, when the Ninth Circuit determined in <em>Santos</em>, that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court did not finally determine the rights of the parties in this case.  The jurisdiction-stripping statute and <em>Santos</em> may have signaled the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ultimate dismissal of the appeal, but neither created a final judgment in the still-pending case.  The attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s appeal remained pending until the Ninth Circuit issued its dismissal order.  And the pendency of the appeal continued to \xe2\x80\x9craise the question whether\xe2\x80\x9d any further action by the court might affect the relationship of the parties.  <em>Hibbs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 98.  Accordingly, we hold that the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court did not become final, for purposes of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review, until the Court of Appeals issued its order dismissing the appeal.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We emphasize that our holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances presented here.  Specifically, our holding does not extend to improperly filed appeals or filings used as delaying tactics.  See <em>Morse</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/151/index.html">270 U. S. 151</a> (1926) (holding that second application for leave to file motion for new trial did not suspend the finality of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having determined that we have jurisdiction, we turn to the merits.  As always, we begin with the text of the statute.  See <em>Nebraska Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Loewenstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/123/index.html">513 U. S. 123</a>, 128 (1994).  Guam\xe2\x80\x99s Organic Act states that \xe2\x80\x9cno public indebtedness of Guam shall be authorized or allowed in excess of 10 per centum of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71423a.  The present dispute centers on the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In its unmodified form, the word \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he estimated worth of a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed. 1951) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s).  But as the parties\xe2\x80\x99 competing interpretations demonstrate, there are different sorts of valuations.  An appraised valuation is the market value of property.  See <em>id.,</em> at 129 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cappraise\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto fix and state the true value of a thing\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, an \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9c[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed amount must be paid as property taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 149.  These two kinds of valuation are related in practice because a property\xe2\x80\x99s assessed valuation generally equals some percentage of its appraised valuation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \xc2\xa724102(f) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthirty-five per cent (35%) of the appraised value\xe2\x80\x9d).  The assessed valuation therefore could, but typically does not, equal the market value of the property.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though it has no established definition, the term \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Were it otherwise, the modifier \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d would have almost no meaning or a meaning inconsistent with ordinary usage.  \xe2\x80\x9cTax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d therefore means \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term consistently defined as a valuation of property for purposes of taxation.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s 149; see also <em>id.,</em> at 116 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he worth or value of property established by taxing authorities on the basis of which the tax rate is applied\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One would not normally refer to a property\xe2\x80\x99s appraised valuation as its \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appraised valuation is simply market value.  And market value may or may not relate to taxation.  Usually market value becomes relevant to taxation only because a specified percentage of market value is the assessed value to which taxing authorities apply the tax rate.  It would strain the text to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d means a valuation a step removed from taxation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Guam Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion by interpreting the word \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d to limit the kinds of property that qualify for inclusion in the debt-limitation calculation.  But that interpretation impermissibly rearranges the statutory language.  The word \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d modifies \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d therefore refers to the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Guam Supreme Court also contrasted 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71423a\xe2\x80\x99s language with explicit references to \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d in the debt-limitation provision for the Virgin Islands.  See \xc2\xa71403 (\xe2\x80\x9caggregate assessed valuation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court reasoned that, by using language in \xc2\xa71423a that differed from that used in the Virgin Islands\xe2\x80\x99 debt-limitation provision, Congress expressed its intent to base Guam\xe2\x80\x99s debt limitation on something other than assessed value.  We disagree.  Certainly, Congress could have used the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessed valuation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But if Congress had meant actual, market, or appraised value, it could have used any one of those terms as well.  See <em>N.\xc2\xa0W. Halsey &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Belle Plaine</em>, 128 Iowa 467, 104 N.\xc2\xa0W. 494 (1905) (interpreting debt-limitation provision using phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactual value\xe2\x80\x9d).  Or it could have left the word \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation\xe2\x80\x9d unmodified: State courts interpreting other debt-limitation provisions have understood \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Board of Education, Rich Cty. School Dist.</em> v. <em>Passey</em>, 122 Utah 102, 104\xe2\x80\x93106, 246 P.\xc2\xa02d 1078, 1079 (1952).  At least in this context, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of \xe2\x80\x9cassessed\xe2\x80\x9d tells us no more than does its rejection of \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cappraised.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation comports with most States\xe2\x80\x99 practice of tying the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valuation.  See 15 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations \xc2\xa741:7, p. 422 (3d ed. rev. 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the constitutional and statutory provisions make the assessed value of the taxable property of the municipality the basis for ascertaining the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  States that depart from the majority approach use clear language to do so.  See <em>id., </em>at 424\xe2\x80\x93425.  (\xe2\x80\x9cThe standard is generally the assessed value of the property for taxation, rather than the actual value, where the two are different; but where the constitution or statute uses the term \xe2\x80\x98actual value,\xe2\x80\x99 such value governs rather than the taxable value\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <em>N.\xc2\xa0W. Halsey &amp; Co.</em>, <em>supra; </em>footnote omitted)).  Congress has not used such language here.  Indeed, as discussed earlier, only a strained reading of \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d would suggest a departure from the majority approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governor suggests that our interpretation would result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value.  For two reasons, we think the Governor has overstated this concern.  First, most States have long based their debt limitations on assessed value without incident.  Second, a strong political check exists; property-owning voters will not fail to notice if the government sets the assessment rate above market value.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Governor mistakenly argues that we owe deference to the Guam Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its Organic Act.  It may be true that we accord deference to territorial courts over matters of purely local concern.  See <em>Pernell</em> v. <em>Southall Realty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/363/index.html">416 U. S. 363</a>, 366 (1974) (reviewing District of Columbia Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of D.\xc2\xa0C. Code provision).  This case does not fit that mold, however.  The debt-limitation provision protects both Guamanians and the United States from the potential consequences of territorial insolvency.  Thus, this case is not a matter of purely local concern.  Of course, decisions of the Supreme Court of Guam, as with other territorial courts, are instructive and are entitled to respect when they indicate how statutory issues, including the Organic Act, apply to matters of local concern.  On the other hand, the Organic Act is a federal statute, which we are bound to construe according to its terms.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0At the time suit was filed, Douglas Moylan served as Guam\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general.

CAMACHO,\nGOVERNOR OF GUAM</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of guam</p>\n<p align="left">[March 27, 2007]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Alito join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree that the petition for writ of certiorari was timely, and join Part II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I disagree, however, that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d in the Organic Act of Guam, \xc2\xa711, 64 Stat. 387, as amended, 48 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71423a, refers unambiguously to assessed value.  If I could not go beyond statutory text and the sources relied upon by the Court, a coin toss would be my only way to judgment.  But I look to congressional purpose, which points to appraised value as the meaning of the term, leaving me in respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The words \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d can plausibly be read in either of the ways the parties suggest: as synonymous with assessed value (the way the attorney general and the Court read them), because it is the assessed value to which the tax rate is immediately applied, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa724102(f), 24103 (1996), or as meaning appraised value, because the appraisal is a \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d purposes.  The Court concedes that the term \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d has no canonical definition, <em>ante</em>, at 6,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]<em> </em>and says that the term \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he estimated worth of a thing,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5 (quoting Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1721 (4th ed. 1951); alteration in original).  Though taking property\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cestimated worth\xe2\x80\x9d to be its \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d would make practical sense, the Court believes that construction would read the word \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.  I do not see the objection, though.  Even if we say \xe2\x80\x9cvaluation\xe2\x80\x9d means actual value, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d has a job to do, by specifying that the valuation in question be the valuation used for tax purposes, thus ruling out an appraisal made solely for the purpose of calculating the debt limitation, with its temptation to indulge in creative accounting when money is tight.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But as I said, seeing the legitimacy of this reading just leaves us with two textually plausible constructions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I see no tie-breaker in comparing Guam\xe2\x80\x99s debt limitation with those of other Territories.  In each Territory mentioned by the parties, when Congress imposed a territorial debt limitation the assessed value was equal to the actual value of the property.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Thus the attorney general can stress the significance of assessed value and argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the assessed value, the same should be true for Guam.  And the Governor can argue that because the debt limitation in the other Territories was based on the actual value, that should go for Guam, too.  Nor is the tie to be broken by arguing that pegging the territorial debt limit to \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that this Territory was meant to be treated more conservatively than a limit turning on full value; the suggestion is balanced by the question (without any answer proposed to us), why Congress would have wished a more restrictive (or nominally more restrictive) regime for certain Territories.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Comparing state practices is no help, either.  The Court says that \xe2\x80\x9cStates that depart from the majority approach\xe2\x80\x9d of linking debt limitations to assessed value \xe2\x80\x9cuse clear language to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, but in the preceding paragraph the majority recognizes that state courts \xe2\x80\x9chave understood \xe2\x80\x98valuation,\xe2\x80\x99 standing alone, to mean the market or cash value of property,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  So it seems a stretch to suggest that state laws offer a clear rule that Congress may be presumed to have understood as background; better to read the state cases as products of the specific wording of their particular limitations and the state history of property taxation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Phelps</em> v. <em>Minneapolis</em>, 174 Minn. 509, 511\xe2\x80\x93514, 219 N.\xc2\xa0W. 872, 873\xe2\x80\x93874 (1928) (relying on text of limitation, other related provisions, and history of property taxation); <em>N. W</em>.<em> Halsey &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Belle Plaine</em>, 128 Iowa 467, 470\xe2\x80\x93474, 104 N.\xc2\xa0W. 494, 495\xe2\x80\x93497 (1905) (same).  It almost goes without saying that neither side has cited a state case involving language and background the same as Guam\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the congressional mind does not emerge from the words \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d or any settled construction of that phrase.  Fortunately, though, the purpose of the legislation does point to a likely reading.  The statute itself makes clear that what Congress meant to provide was a practical guarantee against crushing debt on the shoulders of future generations, and insolvency with the inevitable call for a bailout by Congress.  See <em>United States Nat. Bank of Ore.</em> v. <em>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/439/index.html">508 U. S. 439</a>, 455 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[L]ook to the [law\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\xa6 object and policy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Heirs of Boisdor\xc3\xa9</em>, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorney general claims that her reading is a better fit with these objectives because it ties the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ability to incur debt to its willingness to tax.  But this is hardly so.  Under the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s approach (now the Court\xe2\x80\x99s), the Guam Legislature could double the debt limitation without increasing taxes by a single penny, simply by doubling the assessment rate and cutting the tax rate by half.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although it is arguable that tying the debt ceiling to the assessed value may to some vague degree enhance legislative accountability by requiring action to raise the debt ceiling as debt piles up, I know of no independent suggestion that the debt limit was designed to operate as a political discouragement, not as a hard cap.  It would, after all, have been strange for Congress to set a debt cap to constrain the Guam Legislature, only to leave the limiting figure subject to easy manipulation by the legislature.  While I know that actual valuation can be manipulated, too, manipulation of that figure could only be done by officials acting in bad faith and subject to an obvious political or judicial challenge.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, by contrast, gives the legislature a green light to subvert its own stated limit with a clear conscience.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more practical understanding of what must have been intended is a statute tying the debt limitation to Guam\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to tax property.  The actual, market value of property is the only economic index of Guam\xe2\x80\x99s ability to collect property taxes to pay its bills,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the only figure under consideration that is fixed in the real world, and the only figure that provides a genuine limitation.  This was the figure employed or required by Congress in each of the other Territories mentioned above, see n. 3, <em>supra</em>, and I presume that its practical significance was in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s mind when it set the debt caps for each of them.  I see no reason not to attribute the same practical assessment to Congress in this instance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would affirm.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctax valuation\xe2\x80\x9d had been used in debt limitations for other Territories, see ch. 34, 41 Stat. 1096 (Puerto Rico); ch. 203, 42 Stat. 599 (Philippines), but in each of those Territories the issue in this case was irrelevant because assessed and appraised values were equal.

It is true that the tax computation requires multiplying the appraised value by two percentages (first 35 percent to get the assessed value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \xc2\xa724102(f) (1996), and then the 0.25 percent tax rate, \xc2\xa724103) while the assessed value must only be multiplied by a single percentage.  But as a practical matter, tying the tax to the assessed value ties it to the appraised value: multiplying the appraised value by 0.0875 percent (35 percent times 0.25 percent) will give you the tax every time.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa048 U.
