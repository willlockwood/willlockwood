Nothing I do now, several weeks later, can undo the interruption of the state trial, and I therefore decline to stay the District Court\'s order granting habeas relief to the extent that it enjoins the resumption of the state trial proceedings.</p><p>That portion of the District Court\'s order releasing respondents from custody, however, seems to me to stand on a different footing, and I believe that the State has met the traditional criteria for a stay of the enlargement of a prisoner in a habeas corpus proceeding. The state trial court ruled against respondents\' double jeopardy claims on the merits. In <i>Arizona </i>v. <i>Washington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html">434 U. S. 497</a> (1978), we held that one claiming double jeopardy by reason of a second trial must show that there was no "manifest necessity" for the trial court to grant the State\'s mistrial motion. And we stated that the trial court\'s judgment about the necessity is entitled to great deference, never more so than when the judgment is based on an evaluation of such factors as the admissibility of evidence, any prejudice caused by the introduction of such evidence, and the trial court\'s familiarity with the jurors. <i>Id., </i>at 513-514. <i>Washington </i>indicates that the State will be able to present at the least a substantial case on the merits on appeal, and the other traditional factors in a stay analysis counsel in favor of continued custody. See <i>Hilton </i>v. <i>Braunskill, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/770/case.html">481 U. S. 770</a>, 777-778 (1987) (discussing the circumstances in which a stay of enlargement should be granted under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 23(c) and (d), which are virtually identical to this Court\'s Rules 36.3(b) and 36.4). I will therefore stay the enlargement of respondents under the District Court\'s July 21 order pending disposition of the State\'s appeal from that order (now set for argument before the en banc court on September 26) by the Court of Appeals.</p><p>Accordingly, the application for stay of enlargement is granted, and the application is otherwise denied.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
