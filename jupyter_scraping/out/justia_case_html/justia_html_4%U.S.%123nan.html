On the 5th of June 1784, she made her will, which was proved on the 21st of June, containing, among other things this bequest: \'I give to T. Leaming, in consideration of his many services to me, 200l. in real specie; provided he brings no account against me and my estate; and if he happen to bring any account against me, or my estate, then this bequest to be void;\' with a devise over of the testatrix\'s estate.
