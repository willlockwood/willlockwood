The Act imposes two related conditions: (1) No funds \xe2\x80\x9cmay be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77631(e); and (2) no funds may be used by an organization \xe2\x80\x9cthat does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77631(f).

The District Court issued a preliminary injunction, barring the Government from cutting off respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Leadership Act funding during the litigation or from otherwise taking action based on their privately funded speech.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Policy Requirement, as implemented by the agencies, violated respondents\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of speech.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Policy Requirement violates the \n \nFirst Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.

The \n \nFirst Amendment, however, \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits the government from telling people what they must say.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47\n.  As a direct regulation, the Policy Requirement would plainly violate the \n \nFirst Amendment.  The question is whether the Government may nonetheless impose that requirement as a condition of federal funding.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The Spending Clause grants Congress broad discretion to fund private programs or activities for the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral Welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01, including authority to impose limits on the use of such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends.  Rust v. Sullivan, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173\n, n.\xc2\xa04.  As a general matter, if a party objects to those limits, its recourse is to decline the funds.  In some cases, however, a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  The distinction that has emerged from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases is between conditions that define the limits of the Government spending program\xe2\x80\x94those that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidize\xe2\x80\x94and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the federal program itself.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRust illustrates the distinction.  In that case, the Court considered Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which authorized grants to health-care organizations offering family planning services, but prohibited federal funds from being \xe2\x80\x9cused in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178.  To enforce the provision, HHS regulations barred Title X projects from advocating abortion and required grantees to keep their Title X projects separate from their other projects.  The regulations were valid, the Court explained, because they governed only the scope of the grantee\xe2\x80\x99s Title X projects, leaving the grantee free to engage in abortion advocacy through programs that were independent from its Title X projects.  Because the regulations did not prohibit speech \xe2\x80\x9coutside the scope of the federally funded program,\xe2\x80\x9d they did not run afoul of the \n \nFirst Amendment.  Id., at 197.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The distinction between conditions that define a federal program and those that reach outside it is not always self-evident, but the Court is confident that the Policy Requirement falls on the unconstitutional side of the line.  To begin, the Leadership Act\xe2\x80\x99s other funding condition, which prohibits Leadership Act funds from being used \xe2\x80\x9cto promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77631(e), ensures that federal funds will not be used for prohibited purposes.  The Policy Requirement thus must be doing something more\xe2\x80\x94and it is.  By demanding that funding recipients adopt and espouse, as their own, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view on an issue of public concern, the Policy Requirement by its very nature affects \xe2\x80\x9cprotected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rust, supra, at 197.  A recipient cannot avow the belief dictated by the condition when spending Leadership Act funds, and assert a contrary belief when participating in activities on its own time and dime. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government suggests that if funding recipients could promote or condone prostitution using private funds, \xe2\x80\x9cit would undermine the government\xe2\x80\x99s program and confuse its message opposing prostitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 37.  But the Policy Requirement goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program.  It requires them to pledge allegiance to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy of eradicating prostitution.  That condition on funding violates the \n \nFirst Amendment.

As part of that strategy, Congress authorized the appropriation of billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to assist in the fight.  The Act imposes two related conditions on that funding: First, no funds made available by the Act \xe2\x80\x9cmay be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77631(e).

According to congressional findings, more than 65 million people had been infected by HIV and more than 25 million had lost their lives, making HIV/AIDS the fourth highest cause of death worldwide.  In sub-Saharan Africa alone, AIDS had claimed the lives of more than 19 million individuals and was projected to kill a full quarter of the population of that area over the next decade.  The disease not only directly endangered those infected, but also increased the potential for social and political instability and economic devastation, posing a security issue for the entire international community.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77601(2)\xe2\x80\x93(10).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the Leadership Act, Congress directed the President to establish a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive, integrated\xe2\x80\x9d strategy to combat HIV/AIDS around the world.  \xc2\xa77611(a).  The Act sets out 29 different objectives the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy should seek to fulfill, reflecting a multitude of approaches to the problem.  The strategy must include, among other things, plans to increase the availability of treatment for infected individuals, prevent new infections, support the care of those affected by the disease, promote training for physicians and other health care workers, and accelerate research on HIV/AIDS prevention methods, all while providing a framework for cooperation with international organizations and partner countries to further the goals of the program.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77611(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(29).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] the reduction of HIV/AIDS behavioral risks a priority of all prevention efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77611(a)(12); see also \xc2\xa77601(15) (\xe2\x80\x9cSuccessful strategies to stem the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will require .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. measures to address the social and behavioral causes of the problem\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s approach to reducing behavioral risks is multifaceted.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for addressing such risks must, for example, promote abstinence, encourage monogamy, increase the availability of condoms, promote voluntary counseling and treatment for drug users, and, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9ceducat[e] men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cpromote alternative livelihoods, safety, and social reintegration strategies for commercial sex workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77611(a)(12).  Congress found that the \xe2\x80\x9csex industry, the trafficking of individ- uals into such industry, and sexual violence\xe2\x80\x9d were factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and deter- mined that \xe2\x80\x9cit should be the policy of the United States to eradicate\xe2\x80\x9d prostitution and \xe2\x80\x9cother sexual victimization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77601(23).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States has enlisted the assistance of nongovernmental organizations to help achieve the many goals of the program.

Their work includes programs aimed at limiting injection drug use in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission in Kenya, and promoting safer sex practices in India.  Respondents fear that adopting a policy explicitly opposing prostitution may alienate certain host governments, and may diminish the effectiveness of some of their programs by making it more difficult to work with prostitutes in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  They are also concerned that the Policy Requirement may require them to censor their privately funded discussions in publications, at conferences, and in other forums about how best to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2005, respondents Alliance for Open Society International and Pathfinder International commenced this litigation, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of the Policy Requirement violated their \n \nFirst Amendment rights.

See post, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Our precedents, however, are not so limited.  In the present context, the relevant distinction that has emerged from our cases is between conditions that define the limits of the government spending program\xe2\x80\x94those that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidize\xe2\x80\x94and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.  The line is hardly clear, in part because the definition of a particular program can always be manipulated to subsume the challenged condition.  We have held, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the \n \nFirst Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Legal Services Corporation v.

Taxation With Representation of Washington, the Court upheld a requirement that nonprofit organizations seeking tax-exempt status under \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) not engage in substantial efforts to influence legislation.  The tax-exempt status, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 544.  And by limiting \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) status to organizations that did not attempt to influence legislation, Congress had merely \xe2\x80\x9cchose[n] not to subsidize lobbying.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In rejecting the nonprofit\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFirst Amendment claim, the Court highlighted\xe2\x80\x94in the text of its opinion, but see post, at 5\xe2\x80\x94the fact that the condition did not prohibit that organization from lobbying Congress altogether.  By returning to a \xe2\x80\x9cdual structure\xe2\x80\x9d it had used in the past\xe2\x80\x94separately incorporating as a \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) organization and \xc2\xa7501(c)(4) organization\xe2\x80\x94the nonprofit could continue to claim \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) status for its nonlobbying activities, while attempting to influence legislation in its \xc2\xa7501(c)(4) capac- ity with separate funds.  Ibid.  Maintaining such a structure, the Court noted, was not \xe2\x80\x9cunduly burdensome.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 545, n.\xc2\xa06.  The condition thus did not deny the organization a government benefit \xe2\x80\x9con account of its intention to lobby.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 545.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn FCC v. League of Women Voters of California, by contrast, the Court struck down a condition on federal financial assistance to noncommercial broadcast television and radio stations that prohibited all editorializing, including with private funds.  \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364\n\xe2\x80\x93401 (1984).  Even a station receiving only one percent of its overall budget from the Federal Government, the Court explained, was \xe2\x80\x9cbarred absolutely from all editorializing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 400.  Unlike the situation in Regan, the law provided no way for a station to limit its use of federal funds to noneditorializing activities, while using private funds \xe2\x80\x9cto make known its views on matters of public importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 400.  The prohibition thus went beyond ensuring that federal funds not be used to subsidize \xe2\x80\x9cpublic broadcasting station editorials,\xe2\x80\x9d and instead leveraged the federal funding to regulate the stations\xe2\x80\x99 speech outside the scope of the program.  Id., at 399 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision in Rust v. Sullivan elaborated on the approach reflected in Regan and League of Women Voters.  In Rust, we considered Title X of the Public Health Service Act, a Spending Clause program that issued grants to nonprofit health-care organizations \xe2\x80\x9cto assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects [to] offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The organizations received funds from a variety of sources other than the Federal Government for a variety of purposes.  The Act, however, prohibited the Title X federal funds from being \xe2\x80\x9cused in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  To enforce this provision, HHS regulations barred Title X projects from advocating abortion as a method of family planning, and required grantees to ensure that their Title X projects were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98physically and financially separate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from their other projects that engaged in the prohibited activities.  Id., at 180\xe2\x80\x93181 (quoting 42 CFR \xc2\xa759.9 (1989)).  A group of Title X funding recipients brought suit, claiming the regulations imposed an unconstitutional condition on their \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  We rejected their claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe explained that Congress can, without offending the Constitution, selectively fund certain programs to address an issue of public concern, without funding alterna- tive ways of addressing the same problem.  In Title X, Congress had defined the federal program to encourage only particular family planning methods.  The challenged regulations were simply \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to ensure that the limits of the federal program are observed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat public funds [are] spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rust, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 193, 196.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn making this determination, the Court stressed that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle X expressly distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a Title X project.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 196.  The regulations governed only the scope of the grantee\xe2\x80\x99s Title X projects, leaving it \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered in its other activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Title X grantee can continue to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. engage in abortion advocacy; it simply is required to conduct those activities through programs that are separate and independent from the project that receives Title X funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Because the regulations did not \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[ ] the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program,\xe2\x80\x9d they did not run afoul of the \n \nFirst Amendment.

As Justice Cardozo put it in a related context, \xe2\x80\x9cDefinition more precise must abide the wisdom of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 548, \n591 (1937)\n.

The dissent views the Requirement as simply a selection criterion by which the Government identifies organizations \xe2\x80\x9cwho believe in its ideas to carry them to fruition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 1.  As an initial matter, whatever purpose the Policy Requirement serves in selecting funding recipients, its effects go beyond selection.  The Policy Requirement is an ongoing condition on recipients\xe2\x80\x99 speech and activities, a ground for terminating a grant after selection is complete.  See AAPD 12\xe2\x80\x9304, at 12.  In any event, as the Government acknowledges, it is not simply seeking organizations that oppose prostitution.  Reply Brief 5.  Rather, it explains, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has expressed its purpose \xe2\x80\x98to eradicate\xe2\x80\x99 prostitution and sex trafficking, \n\n22 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77601(23), and it wants recipients to adopt a similar stance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 32 (emphasis added).  This case is not about the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enlist the assistance of those with whom it already agrees.  It is about compelling a grant recipient to adopt a particular belief as a condition of funding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy demanding that funding recipients adopt\xe2\x80\x94as their own\xe2\x80\x94the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects \xe2\x80\x9cprotected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rust, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197.  A recipient cannot avow the belief dictated by the Policy Requirement when spending Leadership Act funds, and then turn around and assert a contrary belief, or claim neutrality, when participating in activities on its own time and dime.  By requiring recipients to profess a specific belief, the Policy Requirement goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program to defining the recipient.  See ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9cour \xe2\x80\x98unconstitutional conditions\xe2\x80\x99 cases involve situations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government contends that the affiliate guidelines, established while this litigation was pending, save the program.  Under those guidelines, funding recipients are permitted to work with affiliated organizations that do not abide by the condition, as long as the recipients retain \xe2\x80\x9cobjective integrity and independence\xe2\x80\x9d from the unfettered affiliates.  45 CFR \xc2\xa789.3.  The Government suggests the guidelines alleviate any unconstitutional burden on the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \n \nFirst Amendment rights by allowing them to either: (1) accept Leadership Act funding and comply with Policy Requirement, but establish affiliates to communicate contrary views on prostitution; or (2) decline funding themselves (thus remaining free to express their own views or remain neutral), while creating affiliates whose sole purpose is to receive and administer Leadership Act funds, thereby \xe2\x80\x9ccabin[ing] the effects\xe2\x80\x9d of the Policy Requirement within the scope of the federal program.

When we have noted the importance of affiliates in this context, it has been because they allow an organization bound by a funding condition to exercise its \n \nFirst Amendment rights outside the scope of the federal program.  See Rust, supra, at 197\xe2\x80\x93198.  Affiliates cannot serve that purpose when the condition is that a funding recipient espouse a specific belief as its own.  If the affiliate is distinct from the recipient, the arrangement does not afford a means for the recipient to express its beliefs.  If the affiliate is more clearly identified with the recipient, the recipient can express those beliefs only at the price of evident hypocrisy.  The guidelines themselves make that clear.  See 45 CFR \xc2\xa789.3 (allowing funding recipients to work with affiliates whose conduct is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the practices of prostitution and sex trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government suggests that the Policy Requirement is necessary because, without it, the grant of federal funds could free a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s private funds \xe2\x80\x9cto be used to promote prostitution or sex trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 27 (citing Holder v.

That argument assumes that federal funding will simply supplant private funding, rather than pay for new programs or expand existing ones.  The Government offers no support for that assumption as a general matter, or any reason to believe it is true here.  And if the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument were correct, League of Women Voters would have come out differently, and much of the reasoning of Regan and Rust would have been beside the point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government cites but one case to support that argument, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project.  That case concerned the quite different context of a ban on providing material support to terrorist organizations, where the record indicated that support for those organizations\xe2\x80\x99 nonviolent operations was funneled to support their violent activities.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 26).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPressing its argument further, the Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9cif organizations awarded federal funds to implement Leadership Act programs could at the same time promote or affirmatively condone prostitution or sex trafficking, whether using public or private funds, it would undermine the government\xe2\x80\x99s program and confuse its message opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 37 (emphasis added).  But the Policy Requirement goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program.  It requires them to pledge allegiance to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy of eradicating prostitution.  As to that, we cannot improve upon what Justice Jackson wrote for the Court 70 years ago: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnette, 319 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 642.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Policy Requirement compels as a condition of fed- eral funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.

This Policy Requirement is nothing more than a means of selecting suitable agents to implement the Government\xe2\x80\x99s chosen strategy to eradicate HIV/AIDS.  That is perfectly permissible under the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFirst Amendment does not mandate a viewpoint-neutral government.  Government must choose between rival ideas and adopt some as its own: competition over cartels, solar energy over coal, weapon development over disarmament, and so forth.  Moreover, the government may enlist the assistance of those who believe in its ideas to carry them to fruition; and it need not enlist for that purpose those who oppose or do not support the ideas.  That seems to me a matter of the most common common sense.  For example: One of the purposes of America\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-aid programs is the fostering of good will towards this country.  If the organization Hamas\xe2\x80\x94reputed to have an efficient system for delivering welfare\xe2\x80\x94were excluded from a program for the distribution of U.\xc2\xa0S. food assistance, no one could reasonably object.  And that would remain true if Hamas were an organization of United States citizens entitled to the protection of the Constitution.  So long as the unfunded organization remains free to engage in its activities (including anti-American propaganda) \xe2\x80\x9cwithout federal assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194, \n212 (2003)\n (plurality), refusing to make use of its assistance for an enterprise to which it is opposed does not abridge its speech.  And the same is true when the rejected organization is not affirmatively opposed to, but merely unsupportive of, the object of the federal program, which appears to be the case here.  (Respondents do not promote prostitution, but neither do they wish to oppose it.)  A federal program to encourage healthy eating habits need not be administered by the American Gourmet Society, which has nothing against healthy food but does not insist upon it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe argument is that this commonsense principle will enable the government to discriminate against, and injure, points of view to which it is opposed.  Of course the Constitution does not prohibit government spending that discriminates against, and injures, points of view to which the government is opposed; every government program which takes a position on a controversial issue does that.  Anti-smoking programs injure cigar aficionados, programs encouraging sexual abstinence injure free-love advocates, etc.  The constitutional prohibition at issue here is not a prohibition against discriminating against or injuring opposing points of view, but the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against the coercing of speech.  I am frankly dubious that a condition for eligibility to participate in a minor federal program such as this one runs afoul of that prohibition even when the condition is irrelevant to the goals of the program.  Not every disadvantage is a coercion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that is not the issue before us here.  Here the views that the Government demands an applicant forswear\xe2\x80\x94or that the Government insists an applicant favor\xe2\x80\x94are relevant to the program in question.  The program is valid only if the Government is entitled to disfavor the opposing view (here, advocacy of or toleration of prostitution).  And if the program can disfavor it, so can the selection of those who are to administer the program.  There is no risk that this principle will enable the Government to discriminate arbitrarily against positions it disfavors.  It would not, for example, permit the Government to exclude from bidding on defense contracts anyone who refuses to abjure pros- titution.  But here a central part of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s HIV/AIDS strategy is the suppression of prostitution, by which HIV is transmitted.  It is entirely reasonable to admit to participation in the program only those who believe in that goal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccording to the Court, however, this transgresses a constitutional line between conditions that operate inside a spending program and those that control speech outside of it.  I am at a loss to explain what this central pillar of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94this distinction that the Court itself admits is \xe2\x80\x9chardly clear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot always self-evident,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 8, 11\xe2\x80\x94has to do with the \n \nFirst Amendment.  The distinction was alluded to, to be sure, in Rust v. Sullivan, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173 (1991)\n, but not as (what the Court now makes it) an invariable requirement for \n \nFirst Amendment validity.  That the pro-abortion speech prohibition was limited to \xe2\x80\x9cinside the program\xe2\x80\x9d speech was relevant in Rust because the program itself was not an anti-abortion program.  The Government remained neutral on that controversial issue, but did not wish abortion to be promoted within its family-planning-services program.  The statutory objective could not be impaired, in other words, by \xe2\x80\x9coutside the program\xe2\x80\x9d pro-abortion speech. The purpose of the limitation was to prevent Government funding from providing the means of pro-abortion propaganda, which the Government did not wish (and had no constitutional obligation) to provide.  The situation here is vastly different.  Elimination of prostitution is an objective of the HIV/AIDS program, and any promotion of prostitution\xe2\x80\x94whether made inside or outside the program\xe2\x80\x94does harm the program.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course the most obvious manner in which the admission to a program of an ideological opponent can frustrate the purpose of the program is by freeing up the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s funds for use in its ideological opposition.  To use the Hamas example again: Subsidizing that organization\xe2\x80\x99s provision of social services enables the money that it would otherwise use for that purpose to be used, instead, for anti-American propaganda.  Perhaps that problem does not exist in this case since the respondents do not affirmatively promote prostitution.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis categorically rejects that justification for ideological requirements in all cases, demanding \xe2\x80\x9crecord indica[tion]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal funding will simply supplant private funding, rather than pay for new programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  This seems to me quite naive.  Money is fungible.  The economic reality is that when NGOs can conduct their AIDS work on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s dime, they can expend greater resources on policies that undercut the Leadership Act.  The Government need not establish by record evidence that this will happen.  To make it a valid consideration in determining participation in federal programs, it suffices that this is a real and obvious risk.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of the cases the Court cites for its holding provide support.  I have already discussed Rust.  As for Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 540 (1983)\n, that case upheld rather than invalidated a prohibition against lobbying as a condition of receiving \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding rested on the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9ca legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 549.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, ante, at 9, stresses the fact that these nonprofits were permitted to use a separate \xc2\xa7501(c)(4) affiliate for their lobbying\xe2\x80\x94but that fact, alluded to in a footnote, Regan, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 545, n.\xc2\xa06, was entirely nonessential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Indeed, that rationale prompted a separate concurrence precisely because the majority of the Court did not rely upon it.  See id., at 551\xe2\x80\x93554 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  As for FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364 (1984)\n, the ban on editorializing at issue there was disallowed precisely because it did not further a relevant, permissible policy of the Federal Communications Act\xe2\x80\x94and indeed was simply incompatible with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caffirmativ[e] encourage[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous expression of controversial opinions\xe2\x80\x9d by licensed broadcasters.  Id., at 397.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court makes a head-fake at the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, ante, at 12, but that doctrine is of no help.  There is no case of ours in which a condition that is relevant to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s valid purpose and that is not in itself unconstitutional (e.g., a religious-affiliation condition that violates the Establishment Clause) has been held to violate the doctrine.*  Moreover, as I suggested earlier, the contention that the condition here \xe2\x80\x9ccoerces\xe2\x80\x9d respondents\xe2\x80\x99 speech is on its face implausible.  Those organizations that wish to take a different tack with respect to prostitution \xe2\x80\x9care as unconstrained now as they were before the enactment of [the Leadership Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, \n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569, \n595 (1998)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  As the Court acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general matter, if a party objects to a condition on the receipt of federal funding, its recourse is to decline the funds,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 7, and to draw on its own coffers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority cannot credibly say that this speech condition is coercive, so it does not.  It pussyfoots around the lack of coercion by invalidating the Leadership Act for \xe2\x80\x9crequiring recipients to profess a specific belief\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemanding that funding recipients adopt\xe2\x80\x94as their own\xe2\x80\x94the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view on an issue of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12 (emphasis mine).  But like King Cnut\xe2\x80\x99s commanding of the tides, here the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crequiring\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemanding\xe2\x80\x9d have no coercive effect.  In the end, and in the circumstances of this case, \xe2\x80\x9ccompell[ing] as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15 (emphasis mine), is no compulsion at all.  It is the reasonable price of admission to a limited government-spending program that each organization remains free to accept or reject.  Section 7631(f) \xe2\x80\x9cdefin[es] the recipient\xe2\x80\x9d only to the extent he decides that it is in his interest to be so defined.

See, e.g., Finley, supra.  As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is quite impossible to distinguish between the two.  If the government cannot demand a relevant ideological commitment as a condition of application, neither can it distinguish between applicants on a relevant ideological ground.  And that is the real evil of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  One can expect, in the future, frequent challenges to the denial of government funding for relevant ideological reasons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion contains stirring quotations from cases like West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.

They serve only to distract attention from the elephant in the room: that the Government is not forcing anyone to say anything.  What Congress has done here\xe2\x80\x94requiring an ideological commitment relevant to the Government task at hand\xe2\x80\x94is approved by the Constitution itself.
