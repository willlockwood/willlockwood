There is a conflict among the Circuits.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 establishes a comprehensive federal program aimed at improving the lot of the handicapped.  Among its purposes, as originally stated, were to</p>\n<p>"promote and expand employment opportunities in the public and private sectors for handicapped individuals and to place such individuals in employment."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701(8).  To further these purposes, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 504 of the Act.  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."</p>\n<p>The language of the section is virtually identical to that of \xc2\xa7 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000d, that similarly bars discrimination (on the ground of race, color, or national origin) in federally assisted programs.</p>\n<p>In 1978, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to specify the means of enforcing its ban on discrimination.  In particular, \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2), as added, 92 Stat. 2982, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 794a(a)(2) (1982 ed.), made available the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964" to victims of discrimination in violation of \xc2\xa7 504 of the Act.

S. 627</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner, Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), was formed pursuant to Subchapter III of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 1004, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701 <em>et seq.</em>  The Act, passed in response to the insolvency of a number of railroads in the Northeast and Midwest, established Conrail to acquire and operate the rail properties of the insolvent railroads and to integrate these properties into an efficient national rail transportation system.  Under \xc2\xa7 216 of the Act, 90 Stat. 89, as amended, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 726 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), the United States, acting through the United States Railway Association, purchases debentures and series A preferred stock of the corporation "at such times and in such amounts as may be required and requested by the Corporation," but "in accordance with the terms and conditions . . . prescribed by the Association. . . ."  \xc2\xa7 726(b)(1).  The statute permits the proceeds from these sales to be devoted to maintenance of rail properties, capital needs, refinancing of indebtedness, or working capital.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under this statutory authorization, Conrail has sold the United States $3.28 billion in securities.  <em>See</em> App. A-15.</p>\n<p>Conrail also received federal funds under Subchapter V of the Act, now repealed, to provide for reassignment and retraining of railroad workers whose jobs were affected by the reorganization.  And Conrail now receives federal funds under \xc2\xa7 1143(a) of the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981, 95 Stat. 662, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 797a (1976 ed., Supp. V), that provides termination allowances of up to $25,000 to workers who lose their jobs as a result of reorganization. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 465 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The complaint alleged that the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, to which Conrail is the successor in interest, had employed the plaintiff as a locomotive engineer; that an accident had required amputation of plaintiff\'s left hand and forearm in 1971; and that, after LeStrange was disabled, the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and then Conrail, had refused to employ him although it had no justification for finding him unfit to work.</p>\n<p>The District Court, following the decision of <em>Trageser v. Libbie Rehabilitation Center, Inc.,</em> 590 F.2d 87 (CA4 1978), <em>cert. denied,</em> 442 U.S. 947 (1979), granted petitioner\'s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff did not have "standing" to bring a private action under \xc2\xa7 504.  <em>LeStrange v. Consolidated Rail Corporation,</em> 501 F.Supp. 964 (MD Pa.1980). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In <em>Trageser,</em> the Fourth Circuit had held that \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act incorporated into that Act the limitation found in \xc2\xa7 604 of Title VI, which provides that employment discrimination is actionable only when the employer receives federal financial assistance the "primary objective" of which is "to provide employment."  The District Court concluded that the aid provided to petitioner did not satisfy the "primary objective" test. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 465 U. S. 629</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the District Court.  <em>LeStrange v. Consolidated Rail Corporation,</em> 687 F.2d 767 (CA3 1982).  There was no opinion for the court, but all three judges of the panel agreed that the cause of action for employment discrimination under \xc2\xa7 504 was not properly limited to situations "where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment."  Judge Bloch, noting that <em>North Haven Board of Education v. Bell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html">456 U. S. 512</a></span> (1982), had construed Title IX to create a private cause of action for employment discrimination in all federally funded education programs, concluded that the language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 504 required the same broad construction of that section.  Judge Adams, concurring in the judgment, found the result compelled by <em>North Haven Board of Education</em> and by the Third Circuit\'s decision in <em>Grove City College v. Bell,</em> 687 F.2d 684 (1982), <em>aff\'d, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/555/case.html">465 U. S. 555</a></span>. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Judge Weis, concurring, argued that Congress had not intended the Rehabilitation Act to incorporate Title VI\'s "primary objective" limitation:  that limitation was designed to temper the Government\'s decision to terminate federal funds, a decision that has more drastic consequences for the funded programs than do private suits for individual relief.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits and to consider other questions under the Rehabilitation Act. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  459 U.S. 1199 (1983).  We affirm. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 465 U. S. 630</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We are met initially by petitioner\'s contention that the death of the plaintiff LeStrange has mooted the case and deprives the Court of jurisdiction for that reason. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Petitioner concedes, however, that there remains a case or controversy if LeStrange\'s estate may recover money that would have been owed to LeStrange. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Without determining the extent to which money damages are available under \xc2\xa7 504, we think it clear that \xc2\xa7 504 authorizes a plaintiff who alleges intentional discrimination to bring an equitable action for backpay.  The case therefore is not moot.</p>\n<p>In <em>Guardians Assn. v. Civil Service Comm\'n of New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html">463 U. S. 582</a></span> (1983), a majority of the Court expressed the view that a private plaintiff under Title VI could recover backpay; and no Member of the Court contended that backpay was unavailable, at least as a remedy for intentional discrimination. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  It is unnecessary to review here the grounds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="631">Page 465 U. S. 631</a></p><p> for this interpretation of Title VI.  It suffices to state that we now apply this interpretation to \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2), which, as we have noted, provides to plaintiffs under \xc2\xa7 504 the remedies set forth in Title VI.  Therefore, respondent, having alleged intentional discrimination, may recover backpay in the present \xc2\xa7 504 suit. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected the argument that petitioner may be sued under \xc2\xa7 504 only if the primary objective of the federal aid that it receives is to promote employment.  Conrail relies particularly on \xc2\xa7 604 of Title VI.  This section limits the applicability of Title VI to "employment practice[s] . . . where a <em>primary objective</em> of the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment" (emphasis added). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As noted above, \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, as added in 1978, adopted the remedies and rights provided in Title VI.  Accordingly, Conrail\'s basic position in this case is that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 465 U. S. 632</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 604\'s limitation was incorporated expressly into the Rehabilitation Act.  The decision of the Court of Appeals therefore should be reversed, Conrail contends, as the primary objective of the federal assistance received by Conrail was not to promote employment.</p>\n<p>It is clear that \xc2\xa7 504 itself contains no such limitation.  Section 504 neither refers explicitly to \xc2\xa7 604 nor contains analogous limiting language; rather, that section prohibits discrimination against the handicapped under "any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."  And it is unquestionable that the section was intended to reach employment discrimination. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Indeed, enhancing employment of the handicapped was so much the focus of the 1973 legislation that Congress the next year felt it necessary to amend the statute to clarify whether \xc2\xa7 504 was intended to prohibit other types of discrimination as well.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 111(a), Pub.L. 93-516, 88 Stat. 1619, amending 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 706(6); S.Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 37 (1974). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Thus, the language of \xc2\xa7 504 suggests </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 465 U. S. 633</a></p><p> that its bar on employment discrimination should not be limited to programs that receive federal aid the primary purpose of which is to promote employment.</p>\n<p>The legislative history, executive interpretation, and purpose of the 1973 enactment all are consistent with this construction.  The legislative history contains no mention of a "primary objective" limitation, although the legislators on numerous occasions adverted to \xc2\xa7 504\'s prohibition against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="634">Page 465 U. S. 634</a></p><p> discrimination in employment by programs assisted with federal funds.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 93-318, pp. 4, 18, 50, 70 (1973); 119 Cong.Rec. 5862 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Cranston); <em>id.</em> at 24587-24588 (remarks of Sen. Williams, Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare).  Moreover, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the agency designated by the President to be responsible for coordinating enforcement of \xc2\xa7 504, <em>see</em> Exec.Order No. 11914, 3 CFR 117 (1977), from the outset has interpreted that section to prohibit employment discrimination by all recipients of federal financial aid, regardless of the primary objective of that aid. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  This Court generally has deferred to contemporaneous regulations issued by the agency responsible for implementing a congressional enactment.  <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html">416 U. S. 267</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html#274">416 U. S. 274</a></span>-275 (1974).  The regulations particularly merit deference in the present case:  the responsible congressional Committees participated in their formulation, and both these Committees and Congress itself endorsed the regulations in their final form. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Finally, application of \xc2\xa7 504 to all programs receiving federal financial assistance fits the remedial purpose of the Rehabilitation Act to "promote and expand employment opportunities" for the handicapped.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701(8). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 465 U. S. 635</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Nor did Congress intend to enact the "primary objective" requirement of \xc2\xa7 604 into the Rehabilitation Act when it amended that Act in 1978.  The amendments, as we have noted, make "available" the remedies, procedures, and rights of Title VI for suits under \xc2\xa7 504 against "any recipient of Federal assistance."  \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 794a(a)(2) (1982 ed.).  These terms do not incorporate \xc2\xa7 604\'s "primary objective" limitation.  Rather, the legislative history reveals that this section was intended to codify the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare governing enforcement of \xc2\xa7 504, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 95-890, p.19 (1978), that prohibited employment discrimination regardless of the purpose of federal financial assistance. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  And it would be anomalous to conclude that the section, "designed to enhance the ability of handicapped individuals to assure compliance with [\xc2\xa7 504]," <em>id.</em> at 18, silently adopted a drastic limitation on the handicapped individual\'s right to sue federal grant recipients for employment discrimination.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 504, by its terms, prohibits discrimination only by a "program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."  This Court on two occasions has considered the meaning of the terms "program or activity" as used in Title </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 465 U. S. 636</a></p><p> IX.  <em>Grove City College v. Bell, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/555/case.html">465 U. S. 555</a></span>; <em>North Haven Board of Education v. Bell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html">456 U. S. 512</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html#535">456 U. S. 535</a></span>-540 (1982).  Clearly, this language limits the ban on discrimination to the specific program that receives federal funds.  Neither opinion, however, provides particular guidance as to the appropriate treatment of the programs before us.  <em>Grove City College</em> considered grants of financial aid to students.  The Court specifically declined to analogize these grants to non-earmarked direct grants and, indeed, characterized them as "<em>sui generis.</em>"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/556/case.html#573">456 U. S. 573</a></span>.  <em>North Haven Board of Education</em> did not undertake to define the term "program" at all, finding that, in the procedural posture of that case, that task should be left to the District Court in the first instance. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html#540">456 U. S. 540</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The procedural posture of the case before us is the same as that of <em>North Haven Board of Education.</em>  The District Court granted a motion for summary judgment on grounds unrelated to the issue of "program specificity."  That judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.  Thus, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals below considered the question whether respondent\'s decedent had sought and been denied employment in a "program . . . receiving Federal financial assistance."

Congress clearly intended to make backpay available to victims of discrimination by the Federal Government, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 95-890, p.19 (1978); and statements made in relation to subsequent legislation by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, the Committee responsible for the 1978 amendments, endorse the availability of backpay.

Employment discrimination thus would have "a profound effect on the provision of relevant and effective [rehabilitation] services."  119 Cong.Rec. 5862 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Cranston).  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 93-318, p. 4 (1973); 119 Cong.Rec. 24587 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Taft); <em>id.</em> at 24588 (remarks of Sen. Williams).  Several other sections of Title V of the Rehabilitation Act also were aimed at discrimination in employment:  \xc2\xa7 501 and \xc2\xa7 503 require all federal employers and federal contractors to adopt affirmative action programs for the handicapped.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>We note further that the Court in an analogous statutory context rejected the contention that the terms used in \xc2\xa7 504 implicitly contain a "primary objective" limitation.  Section 901 of Title IX, like \xc2\xa7 504, borrowed the language of \xc2\xa7 601 of Title VI.  <em>North Haven Board of Education v. Bell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html">456 U. S. 512</a></span> (1982), found, however, that Title IX\'s prohibition of employment discrimination did not incorporate \xc2\xa7 604\'s "primary objective" requirement.  The Court stated that, had Congress wished so to limit Title IX, it would have enacted in that Title counterparts to both \xc2\xa7 601 and \xc2\xa7 604.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html#530">456 U. S. 530</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Petitioner suggests that <em>North Haven</em> is inapplicable to the construction of \xc2\xa7 504 because the Congress considered but rejected a provision explicitly incorporating the language of \xc2\xa7 604 of Title VI into Title IX.  And other aspects of the legislative history also supported the Court\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 901, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html#523">456 U. S. 523</a></span>-529.  In contrast, Congress did not advert to a "primary objective" limitation when drafting \xc2\xa7 504.</p>\n<p>Clearly, petitioner\'s observations do not touch on that aspect of North Haven -- its analysis of the language of \xc2\xa7 601 -- that is relevant to the present case.  But even without the analysis of <em>North Haven,</em> petitioner\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 504\'s language is unfounded.  For language as broad as that of \xc2\xa7 504 cannot be read in isolation from its history and purposes.  <em>See, e.g., Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#608">441 U. S. 608</a></span> (1979); <em>Philbrook v. Glodgett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/707/case.html">421 U. S. 707</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/707/case.html#713">421 U. S. 713</a></span> (1975).  In these respects, \xc2\xa7 504 differs from Title VI in ways that suggest that \xc2\xa7 504 cannot sensibly be interpreted to ban employment discrimination only in programs that receive federal aid the "primary objective" of which is to promote employment.  The "primary objective" limitation of Title VI gave the antidiscrimination provision of that Title a scope that well fits its underlying purposes -- to ensure that "funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination," but "are spent in accordance with the Constitution and the moral sense of the Nation."  110 Cong.Rec. 6544 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).  As the Court of Appeals observed, it was unnecessary to extend Title VI more generally to ban employment discrimination, as Title VII comprehensively regulates such discrimination.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the primary goal of the Act is to increase employment of the handicapped, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/624/case.html#632">465 U. S. 632</a></span>, and n. 12.  However, Congress chose to ban employment discrimination against the handicapped, not by all employers, but only by the Federal Government and recipients of federal contracts and grants.  As to the latter, Congress apparently determined that it would require contractors and grantees to bear the costs of providing employment for the handicapped as a <em>quid pro quo</em> for the receipt of federal funds.  <em>Cf.</em> 118 Cong.Rec. 32305 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Javits).  But this decision to limit \xc2\xa7 504 to the recipients of federal aid does not require us to limit that section still further, as petitioner urges.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 39 Fed.Reg. 18562, 18582 (1974) (revising preexisting provisions to implement \xc2\xa7 504); 41 Fed.Reg. 29548, 29552, 29563 (1976) (proposed Department regulations), promulgated, 42 Fed.Reg. 22678 (\xc2\xa7 84.2), 22680 (\xc2\xa7 84.11), 22688 ("Employment Practices") (1977); 43 Fed.Reg. 2132, 2138 (1978) (final coordinating regulations).</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice, now responsible for coordinating agency implementation of \xc2\xa7 504, <em>see</em> Exec.Order No. 12250, 3 CFR 298 (1981), adopted the HEW guidelines, 46 Fed.Reg. 40686 (1981).  The Department of Transportation, from which Conrail receives federal aid, also has construed \xc2\xa7 504 to prohibit employment discrimination in all programs receiving federal financial assistance.  44 Fed.Reg. 31442, 31468 (1979), codified at 49 CFR pt. 27 (1983). <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 27.31.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 25 (1974).  In adopting \xc2\xa7 505(a)(2) in the amendments of 1978, Congress incorporated the substance of the Department\'s regulations into the statute.  <em>See</em> n.  <a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a> <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The Committee noted:</p>\n<p>"[T]he regulations promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to procedures, remedies, and rights under \xc2\xa7 504 conform with those promulgated under title VI.  Thus, this amendment codifies existing practice as a specific statutory requirement."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 95-890, p.19 (1978).  Although these Department regulations incorporated Title VI regulations governing "complaint and enforcement procedures," <em>see</em> 42 Fed.Reg. 22685, 22694-22701 (1977), the regulations implementing \xc2\xa7 504 did not incorporate \xc2\xa7 80.3 of the Title VI regulations, which limit Title VI\'s application to employment discrimination in federal programs to increase employment.  The \xc2\xa7 504 regulations banned employment discrimination in programs receiving any form of federal financial assistance.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court held that the Court of Appeals in that case had erroneously suggested that HEW regulations issued under Title XI to govern employment discrimination need not be program-specific.  <em>See</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/case.html#536">456 U.
