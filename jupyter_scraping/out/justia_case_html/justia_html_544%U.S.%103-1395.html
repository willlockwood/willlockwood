DOE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">TENET et al. <em>v.</em> DOE et ux.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931395.Argued January 11, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 2, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent husband and wife filed suit against the United States and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel and due process claims for the CIA\xe2\x80\x99s alleged failure to provide them with financial assistance it had promised in return for their espionage services during the Cold War.  The District Court denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, finding that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not barred by the rule of <em>Totten</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/105/index.html">92 U. S. 105</a>, prohibiting suits against the Government based on covert espionage agreements.  Affirming in relevant part, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that <em>Totten</em> posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims and thus the case could proceed to trial, subject to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s asserting the evidentiary state secrets privilege and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolving that issue.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit is barred by the <em>Totten</em> rule.  In <em>Totten, </em>this<em> </em>Court concluded with no difficulty that the President had the authority to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, observed that the very essence of such a contract was that it was secret and had to remain so, and found that allowing a former spy to bring suit to enforce such a contract would be entirely incompatible with the contract\xe2\x80\x99s nature.  The Ninth Circuit was quite wrong in holding that <em>Totten </em>does not require dismissal of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  It reasoned that <em>Totten</em> developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-of-contract claims seeking to enforce an espionage agreement\xe2\x80\x99s terms but not barring due process or estoppel claims.  However, <em>Totten</em> was not so limited.  It precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents\xe2\x80\x99 where success depends on the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the Government.  <em>Id.,</em> at 107.  The Ninth Circuit also claimed that <em>Totten</em> had been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary \xe2\x80\x9cstate secrets\xe2\x80\x9d privilege, rather than a categorical bar to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims, relying mainly on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reynolds,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/1/index.html">345 U. S. 1</a>, in which widows of civilians killed in a military plane crash sought privileged military information in their wrongful death action against the Government.  While the <em>Reynolds </em>Court looked to <em>Totten</em> in invoking the \xe2\x80\x9cwell established\xe2\x80\x9d state secrets privilege, it in no way signaled a retreat from <em>Totten</em>\xe2\x80\x99s broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage agreements are altogether forbidden.  The Court later credited <em>Totten\xe2\x80\x99</em>s more sweeping holding in <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Catholic Action of Haw./Peace Ed. Project,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/139/index.html">454 U. S. 139</a>, 146\xe2\x80\x93147, thus confirming its continued validity.  <em>Reynolds </em>therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced<em> Totten</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical bar in the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.  Nor does <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Doe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/592/index.html">486 U. S. 592</a>, which addressed constitutional claims made by acknowledged (though covert) CIA employees, support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  Only in the case of an alleged former spy is<em> Totten\xe2\x80\x99</em>s core concern implicated: preventing the existence of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the Government from being revealed.  The state secrets privilege and the use of <em>in camera</em> judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection the Court found necessary in enunciating the <em>Totten</em> rule.  The possibility that a suit may proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed is unacceptable.  Forcing the Government to litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to \xe2\x80\x9cgraymail,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> individual lawsuits brought to induce the CIA to settle a case out of fear that litigation would reveal classified information that might undermine covert operations.  And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.

S. 105</a> (1876), we held that public policy forbade a self-styled Civil War spy from suing the United States to enforce its obligations under their secret espionage agreement.  Respondents here, alleged former Cold War spies, filed suit against the United States and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel and due process claims for the CIA\xe2\x80\x99s alleged failure to provide respondents with the assistance it had promised in return for their espionage services.  Finding that <em>Totten</em> did not bar respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit, the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the case could proceed.  We reverse because this holding contravenes the longstanding rule, announced more than a century ago in <em>Totten</em>, prohibiting suits against the Government based on covert espionage agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, a husband and wife who use the fictitious names John and Jane Doe, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  According to respondents, they were formerly citizens of a foreign country that at the time was considered to be an enemy of the United States, and John Doe was a high-ranking diplomat for the country.  After respondents expressed interest in defecting to the United States, CIA agents persuaded them to remain at their posts and conduct espionage for the United States for a specified period of time, promising in return that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cwould arrange for travel to the United States and ensure financial and personal security for life.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a.  After \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying out their end of the bargain\xe2\x80\x9d by completing years of purportedly high-risk, valuable espionage services, <em>id.</em>, at 123a, respondents defected (under new names and false backgrounds) and became United States citizens, with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s help.  The CIA designated respondents with \xe2\x80\x9cPL\xe2\x80\x93110\xe2\x80\x9d status and began providing financial assistance and personal security.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the CIA\xe2\x80\x99s help, respondent John Doe obtained employment in the State of Washington.  As his salary increased, the CIA decreased his living stipend until, at some point, he agreed to a discontinuation of benefits while he was working.  Years later, in 1997, John Doe was laid off after a corporate merger.  Because John Doe was unable to find new employment as a result of CIA restrictions on the type of jobs he could hold, respondents contacted the CIA for financial assistance.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Denied such assistance by the CIA, they claim they are unable to properly provide for themselves.  Thus, they are faced with the prospect of either returning to their home country (where they say they face extreme sanctions), or remaining in the United States in their present circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents assert, among other things<em>,</em> that the CIA violated their procedural and substantive due process rights by denying them support and by failing to provide them with a fair internal process for reviewing their claims.  They seek injunctive relief ordering the CIA to resume monthly financial support pending further agency review.  They also request a declaratory judgment stating that the CIA failed to provide a constitutionally adequate review process, and detailing the minimal process the agency must provide.  Finally, respondents seek a mandamus order requiring the CIA to adopt agency procedures, to give them fair review, and to provide them with security and financial assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), principally on the ground that <em>Totten</em> bars respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  The District Court dismissed some of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims but denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Totten</em> objection, ruling that the due process claims could proceed.  99 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1284, 1289\xe2\x80\x931294 (WD Wash. 2000).  After minimal discovery, the Government renewed its motion to dismiss based on <em>Totten</em>, and it moved for summary judgment on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 due process claims.  Apparently construing the complaint as also raising an estoppel claim, the District Court denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motions, ruled again that <em>Totten</em> did not bar respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims, and found there were genuine issues of material fact warranting a trial on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 due process and estoppel claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a\xe2\x80\x9394a.  The District Court certified an order for interlocutory appeal and stayed further proceedings pending appeal.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79a\xe2\x80\x9383a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  329 F.\xc2\xa03d 1135 (2003).  It reasoned that <em>Totten</em> posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims and thus that the case could proceed to trial, subject to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s asserting the evidentiary state secrets privilege and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolving that issue.  329 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1145\xe2\x80\x931155.  Over dissent, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  353 F.\xc2\xa03d 1141 (CA9 2004).  The Government sought review, and we granted certiorari.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  542 U. S. ___ (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Totten</em>, the administrator of William A. Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s estate brought suit against the United States to recover compensation for services that Lloyd allegedly rendered as a spy during the Civil War.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/105/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/105/index.html">92 U. S. 105</a>.  Lloyd purportedly entered into a contract with President Lincoln in July 1861 to spy behind Confederate lines on troop placement and fort plans, for which he was to be paid $200 a month.  <em>Id.</em>, at 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  The lower court had found that Lloyd performed on the contract but did not receive full compensation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 106.  After concluding with \xe2\x80\x9cno difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> that the President had the authority to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, we observed that the very essence of the alleged contract between Lloyd and the Government was that it was secret, and had to remain so:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be equally concealed.  Both employer and agent must have understood that the lips of the other were to be for ever sealed respecting the relation of either to the matter.  This condition of the engagement was implied from the nature of the employment, and is implied in all secret employments of the government in time of war, or upon matters affecting our foreign relations, where a disclosure of the service might compromise or embarrass our government in its public duties, or endanger the person or injure the character of the agent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThus, we thought it entirely incompatible with the nature of such a contract that a former spy could bring suit to enforce it.  Id.</em>, at 106\xe2\x80\x93107.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the Court of Appeals was quite wrong in holding that <em>Totten</em> does not require dismissal of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  That court, and respondents here, reasoned first that <em>Totten</em> developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-of-contract claims seeking to enforce the terms of espionage agreements but not barring claims based on due process or estoppel theories.  In fact, <em>Totten</em> was not so limited: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance of <em>any</em> <em>suit</em> in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 107 (emphasis added); see also <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe secrecy which such contracts impose precludes <em>any action</em> for their enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  No matter the clothing in which alleged spies dress their claims, <em>Totten</em> precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents\xe2\x80\x99 where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying mainly on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reynolds</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/1/index.html">345 U. S. 1</a> (1953), the Court of Appeals also claimed that <em>Totten</em> has been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary \xe2\x80\x9cstate secrets\xe2\x80\x9d privilege, rather than a categorical bar to their claims.  <em>Reynolds</em> involved a wrongful-death action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346, by the widows of three civilians who died in the crash of a military B\xe2\x80\x9329 aircraft.  345 U. S., at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  In the course of discovery, the plaintiffs sought certain investigation-related documents, which the Government said contained \xe2\x80\x9chighly secret,\xe2\x80\x9d privileged military information.  <em>Id.</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  We recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe privilege against revealing military secrets, a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, and we set out a balancing approach for courts to apply in resolving Government claims of privilege, <em>id.</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311.  We ultimately concluded that the Government was entitled to the privilege in that case.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When invoking the \xe2\x80\x9cwell established\xe2\x80\x9d state secrets privilege, we indeed looked to <em>Totten</em>.  <em>Reynolds, supra,</em> at 7, n.\xc2\xa011 (citing <em>Totten</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 107).  See also Brief for United States in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reynolds,</em> O. T. 1952, No. 21, pp. 36, 42 (citing <em>Totten</em> in support of a military secrets privilege).  But that in no way signaled our retreat from <em>Totten</em>\xe2\x80\x99s broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage agreements are altogether forbidden.  Indeed, our opinion in <em>Reynolds</em> refutes this very suggestion: Citing <em>Totten</em> as a case \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the very subject matter of the action, a contract to perform espionage, was a matter of state secret,\xe2\x80\x9d we declared that such a case was to be \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed <em>on the pleadings without ever reaching the question of evidence</em>, since it was so obvious that the action should never prevail over the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  345 U. S., at 11, n.\xc2\xa026 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a later case, we again credited the more sweeping holding in <em>Totten</em>, thus confirming its continued validity.  See <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Catholic Action of Haw./Peace Ed. Project,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/139/index.html">454 U. S. 139</a>, 146\xe2\x80\x93147 (1981) (citing <em>Totten</em> in holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not the Navy has complied with [\xc2\xa7102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 853, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74332(2)(C)] \xe2\x80\x98to the fullest extent possible\xe2\x80\x99 is beyond judicial scrutiny in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d where, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue to national security reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d the Navy could \xe2\x80\x9cneither admit nor deny\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that was central to the suit, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it propose[d] to store nuclear weapons\xe2\x80\x9d at a facility).  <em>Reynolds</em> therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced the categorical <em>Totten</em> bar with the balancing of the state secrets evidentiary privilege in the dis-\ntinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Doe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/592/index.html">486 U. S. 592</a> (1988), support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  There, we held that \xc2\xa7102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 498, 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7403(c), may not be read to exclude judicial review of the constitutional claims made by a former CIA employee for alleged discrimination.  486 U. S., at 603.  In reaching that conclusion, we noted the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98serious constitutional question\xe2\x80\x99 that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citation omitted).  But there is an obvious difference, for purposes of <em>Totten</em>, between a suit brought by an acknowledged (though covert) employee of the CIA and one filed by an alleged former spy.  Only in the latter scenario is <em>Totten</em>\xe2\x80\x99s core concern implicated: preventing the existence of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the Government from being revealed.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  That is why the CIA regularly entertains Title VII claims concerning the hiring\nand promotion of its employees, as we noted in <em>Webster</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 604, yet <em>Totten</em> has long barred suits such as respondents\xe2\x80\x99.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, in short, no basis for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view that the <em>Totten</em> bar has been reduced to an example of the state secrets privilege.  In a far closer case than this, we observed that if the \xe2\x80\x9cprecedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 484 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We adhere to <em>Totten</em>.  The state secrets privilege and the more frequent use of <em>in camera</em> judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection we found necessary in enunciating the <em>Totten</em> rule.  The possibility that a suit may proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed, if the state secrets privilege is found not to apply, is unacceptable: \xe2\x80\x9cEven a small chance that some court will order disclosure of a source\xe2\x80\x99s identity could well impair intelligence gathering and cause sources to \xe2\x80\x98close up like a clam.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>CIA</em> v. <em>Sims</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/159/index.html">471 U. S. 159</a>, 175 (1985).  Forcing the Government to litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to \xe2\x80\x9cgraymail,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, individual lawsuits brought to induce the CIA to settle a case (or prevent its filing) out of fear that any effort to litigate the action would reveal classified information that may undermine ongoing covert operations.  And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed<em>.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government has neither confirmed nor denied any of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegations.

Later, respondents claim they were told the agency determined \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits previously provided were adequate for the services rendered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 129a.  Although the CIA apparently did not disclose to respondents the agency\xe2\x80\x99s appeals process, respondents were permitted to appeal the initial determination both to the Director of the CIA and to a panel of former agency officials called the Helms Panel; both appeals were denied.  <em>Id.</em>, at 129a\xe2\x80\x93132a.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Preliminarily, we must address whether <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and the Government did not seek review on this question in its petition for certiorari.  Pet. for Cert. 8, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We may assume for purposes of argument that this Tucker Act question is the kind of jurisdictional issue that <em>Steel Co.</em> directs must be resolved before addressing the merits of a claim.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mitchell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/206/index.html">463 U. S. 206</a>, 212, 215 (1983) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tucker Act effects a waiver of sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d and observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of consent [to be sued] is a prerequisite for jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nevertheless, application of the <em>Totten</em> rule of dismissal, like the abstention doctrine of <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971), or the prudential standing doctrine, represents the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold question\xe2\x80\x9d we have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdiction.  See <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 585 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Kowalski </em>v.<em> Tesmer, </em>543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 3) (assuming Article III standing in order to \xe2\x80\x9caddress the alternative threshold question whether\xe2\x80\x9d attorneys had third-party standing); <em>Steel Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 100, n.\xc2\xa03 (approving a decision resolving <em>Younger</em> abstention before addressing subject-matter jurisdiction). It would be inconsistent with the unique and categorical nature of the <em>Totten</em> bar\xe2\x80\x94a rule designed not merely to defeat the asserted claims, but to preclude judicial inquiry\xe2\x80\x94to first allow discovery or other proceedings in order to resolve the jurisdictional question.  Thus, whether or not the Government was permitted to waive the Tucker Act question, we may dismiss respondents\xe2\x80\x99 cause of action on the ground that it is barred by <em>Totten</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals apparently believed that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the CIA <em>was</em> secret in <em>Webster</em>, just as in this case.  See 329 F.\xc2\xa03d 1135, 1153 (CA9 2003).  It is true that the plaintiff in <em>Webster</em> proceeded under a pseudonym because \xe2\x80\x9chis status as a CIA employee cannot be publicly acknowledged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, O.

There may be situations in which the national interest would be well served by a rule that permitted similar commitments made by less senior officers to be enforced in court, subject to procedures designed to protect sensitive information.  If that be so, Congress can modify the federal common-law rule announced in <em>Totten</em>.  For the purposes of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, which I join, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>provides a sufficient justification for concluding that the complaint is without merit.  The Court wisely decides that the absence of an enforceable agreement requires that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional and other claims be dismissed without first answering an arguably antecedent jurisdictional question.
