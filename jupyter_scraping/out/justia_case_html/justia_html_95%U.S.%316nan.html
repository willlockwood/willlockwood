That the bond was a common distiller\'s bond, and that they signed it merely as sureties for Hosmer, without consideration, and for his accommodation; that, six days before its execution, Hosmer, without their knowledge, encumbered the ground upon which the distillery stood, by his mortgage of the same to one Dempsey, which was duly recorded May 25, 1871; that the plaintiff did not require, nor did Hosmer file with the assessor, the written consent of Dempsey that the lien of the United States for taxes and penalties should have priority to the mortgage, and that the title should, in case of forfeiture, vest in the United States, discharged of said mortgage, nor was Hosmer required to, nor did he, execute an indemnity bond against said mortgage, as required by the Act of Congress approved April 10, 1869, but that the bond sued on was approved without the filing of such consent or the taking of such indemnity bond; that by reason of the nonpayment by Hosmer of the taxes on distilled spirits which were chargeable and a lien upon said ground, a part of it was distrained and sold for $6,100, which sum, if the amount of Dempsey\'s mortgage had not been deducted therefrom, would have been sufficient to pay Hosmer\'s indebtedness to the United States.</p>\n<p>3.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The second defense relied upon in this case is disposed of by <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/86/577/case.html">Osborne v. United States,</a></span></em> 19 Wall. 577, which we are not inclined to reconsider.</p>\n<p>The third defense is equally bad.  Under the law as it stood when this suit was commenced, no distilled spirits could be removed from a distillery warehouse before payment of the tax, 15 Stat. 130, sec. 15, without subjecting all those engaged in such a removal to heavy penalties, <em>id.,</em> 140, sec. 36.  An officer of the United States had no authority to dispense with this requirement of the law.  If in violation of his duty he permitted such a removal, he subjected himself to punishment, but did not bind the government by his acts.  The government is not responsible for the laches or the wrongful acts of its officers.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/269/case.html">Gibbons v. United States,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 269; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/720/case.html">United States v. Kirkpatrick,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 720; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/24/184/case.html">United States v. Vanzandt,</a></span></em> 11 Wheat. 184; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/505/case.html">United States v. Nicholl,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 505; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/85/662/case.html">Jones v. United States,</a></span></em> 18 Wall. 662.  Every surety upon an official bond to the government is presumed to enter into his contract with a full knowledge of this principle of law, and to consent to be dealt with accordingly.  The government enters into no contract with him that its officers shall perform their duties.  A government may be a loser by the negligence of its officers, but it never becomes bound to others for the consequences of such neglect unless it be by express agreement to that effect.  Here, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 95 U. S. 319</a></p><p> the surety was aware of the lien which the law gave as security for the payment of the tax.  He also knew that in order to retain this lien, the government must rely upon the diligence and honesty of its agents.  If they performed their duties and preserved the security, it inured to his benefit as well as that of the government; but if by neglect or misconduct they lost it, the government did not come under obligations to make good the loss to him or, what is the same thing, release him <em>pro tanto</em> from the obligation of his bond.  As between himself and the government, he took the risk of the effect of official negligence upon the security which the law provided for his protection against loss by reason of the liability he assumed.</p>\n<p>There was no error in striking out that portion of the first defense which was objected to.  It was not responsive to any allegation in the petition.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
