Tony pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $200,000.  Terry went to trial and was convicted.  Despite conceding that Terry had no controlling interest in the store and did not stand to benefit personally from the sales of the product, the Government asked the District Court to hold him jointly and severally liable for the profits from the illegal sales and sought a judgment of $69,751.98, the outstanding conspiracy profits.  The District Court declined to enter a forfeiture judgment against Terry, reasoning that he was a salaried employee who had not received any profits from the sales.

This case concerns how \xc2\xa7853 operates when two or more defendants act as part of a conspiracy.  Specifically, the issue is whether, under \xc2\xa7853, a defendant may be held jointly and severally liable for property that his co-conspirator derived from the crime but that the defendant himself did not acquire.  The Court holds that such liability is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Terry Michael Honeycutt managed sales and inventory for a Tennessee hardware store owned by his brother, Tony Honeycutt.  After observing several \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98edgy looking folks\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d purchasing an iodine-based water-purification product known as Polar Pure, Terry Honeycutt contacted the Chattanooga Police Department to inquire whether the iodine crystals in the product could be used to manufacture methamphetamine.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.  An officer confirmed that individuals were using Polar Pure for this purpose and advised Honeycutt to cease selling it if the sales made Honeycutt \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Notwithstanding the officer\xe2\x80\x99s advice, the store continued to sell large quantities of Polar Pure.  Although each bottle of Polar Pure contained enough iodine to purify 500 gallons of water, and despite the fact that most people have no legitimate use for the product in large quantities, the brothers sold as many as 12 bottles in a single transaction to a single customer.  Over a 3-year period, the store grossed roughly $400,000 from the sale of more than 20,000 bottles of Polar Pure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unsurprisingly, these sales prompted an investigation by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration along with state and local law enforcement.  Authorities exe-cuted a search warrant at the store in November 2010 and seized its entire inventory of Polar Pure\xe2\x80\x94more than 300 bottles.  A federal grand jury indicted the Honeycutt brothers for various federal crimes relating to their sale of iodine while knowing or having reason to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine.  Pursuant to the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984, \xc2\xa7303,\n\n98Stat.\n2045,\n\n21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7853(a)(1), which mandates forfeiture of \xe2\x80\x9cany proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\xe2\x80\x9d drug distribution, the Government sought forfeiture money judgments against each brother in the amount of $269,751.98, which represented the hardware store\xe2\x80\x99s profits from the sale of Polar Pure.  Tony Honeycutt pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $200,000.  Terry went to trial.  A jury acquitted Terry Honeycutt of 3 charges but found him guilty of the remaining 11, including conspiring to and knowingly distributing iodine in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(c)(2), 843(a)(6), and 846.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court sentenced Terry Honeycutt to 60 months in prison.  Despite conceding that Terry had no \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling interest in the store\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdid not stand to benefit personally,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government insisted that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9chold [him] jointly liable for the profit from the illegal sales.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a\xe2\x80\x9361a.  The Government thus sought a money judgment of $69,751.98, the amount of the conspiracy profits outstanding after Tony Honeycutt\xe2\x80\x99s forfeiture payment.  The District Court declined to enter a forfeiture judgment, reasoning that Honeycutt was a salaried employee who had not person-ally received any profits from the iodine sales.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  As co-conspirators, the court held, the brothers are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98jointly and severally liable for any proceeds of the conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  816 F.\xc2\xa03d 362, 380 (2016).

Such statutes serve important governmental interests such as \xe2\x80\x9cseparating a criminal from his ill-gotten gains,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creturning property, in full, to those wrongfully deprived or defrauded of it,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clessen[ing] the economic power\xe2\x80\x9d of criminal enterprises.  <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 617\n\xe2\x80\x93630 (1989).  The statute at issue here\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa7853\xe2\x80\x94mandates forfeiture with respect to persons convicted of certain serious drug crimes.  The question presented is whether \xc2\xa7853 embraces joint and several liability for forfeiture judgments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A creature of tort law, joint and several liability \xe2\x80\x9capplies when there has been a judgment against multiple defendants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McDermott, Inc.</i> v. <i>AmClyde</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 202\n\xe2\x80\x93221 (1994).  If two or more defendants jointly cause harm, each defendant is held liable for the entire amount of the harm; provided, however, that the plaintiff recover only once for the full amount.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7875 (1977).  Application of that principle in the forfeiture context when two or more defendants conspire to violate the law would require that each defendant be held liable for a forfeiture judgment based not only on property that he used in or acquired because of the crime, but also on property obtained by his co-conspirator.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An example is instructive.  Suppose a farmer masterminds a scheme to grow, harvest, and distribute mari-juana on local college campuses.  The mastermind recruits a college student to deliver packages and pays the student $300 each month from the distribution proceeds for his services.  In one year, the mastermind earns $3 million.  The student, meanwhile, earns $3,600.  If joint and sev-eral liability applied, the student would face a forfeiture judgment for the entire amount of the conspiracy\xe2\x80\x99s proceeds: $3 million.  The student would be bound by that judgment even though he never personally acquired any proceeds beyond the $3,600.  This case requires determination whether this form of liability is permitted under \xc2\xa7853(a)(1).  The Court holds that it is not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Forfeiture under \xc2\xa7853 applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d convicted of certain serious drug crimes.  Section 853(a) limits the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach by defining the property subject to forfeit-ure in three separate provisions.  An understanding of how these three provisions work to limit the operation of the statute is helpful to resolving the question in this case.  First, the provision at issue here, \xc2\xa7853(a)(1), limits forfeit-ure to \xe2\x80\x9cproperty constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\xe2\x80\x9d the crime.  Second, \xc2\xa7853(a)(2) restricts forfeiture to \xe2\x80\x9cproperty used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of,\xe2\x80\x9d the crime.  Finally, \xc2\xa7853(a)(3) applies to persons \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a form of conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94and requires forfeiture of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty described in paragraph (1) or (2)\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cany of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] interest in, claims against, and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over, the continuing criminal enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  These provisions, by their terms, limit forfeiture under \xc2\xa7853 to tainted property; that is, property flowing from (\xc2\xa7853(a)(1)), or used in (\xc2\xa7853(a)(2)), the crime itself.  The limitations of \xc2\xa7853(a) thus provide the first clue that the statute does not countenance joint and several liability, which, by its nature, would require forfeiture of untainted property.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Recall, for example, the college student from the earlier hypothetical.  The $3,600 he received for his part in the marijuana distribution scheme clearly falls within \xc2\xa7853(a)(1): It is property he \xe2\x80\x9cobtained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the result of\xe2\x80\x9d the crime.  But if he were held jointly and severally liable for the proceeds of the entire conspiracy, he would owe the Government $3 million.  Of the $3 million, $2,996,400 would have no connection whatsoever to the student\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the crime and would have to be paid from the student\xe2\x80\x99s untainted assets.  Joint and several liability would thus represent a departure from \xc2\xa7853(a)\xe2\x80\x99s restriction of forfeiture to tainted property.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to limiting forfeiture to tainted property, \xc2\xa7853(a) defines forfeitable property solely in terms of personal possession or use.  This is most clear in the specific text of \xc2\xa7853(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94the provision under which the Government sought forfeiture in this case.  Section 853(a)(1) limits forfeiture to property the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cobtained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the result of\xe2\x80\x9d the crime.  At the time Congress enacted \xc2\xa7853(a)(1), the verb \xe2\x80\x9cobtain\xe2\x80\x9d was defined as \xe2\x80\x9cto come into possession of\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cget or acquire.\xe2\x80\x9d  Random House Dictionary of the English Language 995 (1966); see also 7 Oxford English Dictionary 37 (1933) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cobtain\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o come into the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one\xe2\x80\x99s own effort, or by request; to procure or gain, as the result of purpose and effort\xe2\x80\x9d).  That definition persists today.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1247 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cobtain\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o bring into one\xe2\x80\x99s own possession; to procure, esp. through effort\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>Sekhar</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935) (\xe2\x80\x9cObtaining property requires \xe2\x80\x98.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the acquisition of property\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Neither the dictionary definition nor the common usage of the word \xe2\x80\x9cobtain\xe2\x80\x9d supports the conclusion that an individual \xe2\x80\x9cobtains\xe2\x80\x9d property that was acquired by someone else.  Yet joint and several liability would mean just that: The college student would be presumed to have \xe2\x80\x9cobtained\xe2\x80\x9d the $3 million that the mastermind acquired.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 853(a)(1) further provides that the forfeitable property may be \xe2\x80\x9cobtained, directly or<i> </i>indirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d  The adverbs \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindirectly\xe2\x80\x9d modify\xe2\x80\x94but do not erase\xe2\x80\x94the verb \xe2\x80\x9cobtain.\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, these adverbs refer to how a defendant obtains the property; they do not negate the requirement that he obtain it at all.  For instance, the marijuana mastermind might receive payments directly from drug purchasers, or he might arrange to have drug purchasers pay an intermediary such as the college student.  In all instances, he ultimately \xe2\x80\x9cobtains\xe2\x80\x9d the property\xe2\x80\x94whether \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly or indirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The other provisions of \xc2\xa7853(a) are in accord with the limitation of forfeiture to property the defendant himself obtained.  Section 853(a)(2) mandates forfeiture of prop-erty used to facilitate the crime but limits forfeiture to \xe2\x80\x9cthe person\xe2\x80\x99s property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, \xc2\xa7853(a)(3) requires forfeit-ure of property related to continuing criminal enterprises, but contrary to joint and several liability principles, requires the defendant to forfeit only \xe2\x80\x9chis interest in\xe2\x80\x9d the enterprise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 853(a)\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of forfeiture to tainted property acquired or used by the defendant, together with the plain text of \xc2\xa7853(a)(1), foreclose joint and several liability for co-conspirators. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Joint and several liability is not only contrary to \xc2\xa7853(a), it is\xe2\x80\x94for the same reasons\xe2\x80\x94contrary to several other provisions of \xc2\xa7853.  Two provisions expressly incorporate the \xc2\xa7853(a) limitations.  First, \xc2\xa7853(c) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.</i>, tainted property obtained as the result of or used to facilitate the crime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consistent with its text, the Court has previously acknowledged that \xc2\xa7853(c) applies to tainted property only.  See <i>Luis</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8). </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, \xc2\xa7853(e)(1) authorizes pretrial freezes \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for forfeiture.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pretrial restraints on forfeitable property are permitted only when the Government proves, at a hearing, that (1) the defendant has committed an offense triggering forfeiture, and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe property at issue has the requisite connection to that crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kaley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3); see also<i>id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa011 (slip op., at 15, n.\xc2\xa011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]orfeiture applies only to specific assets\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another provision, \xc2\xa7853(d), does not reference subsection (a) but incorporates its requirements on its own terms.

Contrary to all of these provisions, joint and several liability would mandate forfeiture of untainted property that the defendant did not acquire as a result of the crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It would also render futile one other provision of the statute.  Section 853(p)\xe2\x80\x94the sole provision of \xc2\xa7853 that permits the Government to confiscate property untainted by the crime\xe2\x80\x94lays to rest any doubt that the statute permits joint and several liability.  That provision governs forfeiture of \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute property\xe2\x80\x9d and applies \xe2\x80\x9cif any property described in subsection (a), as a result of any act or omission of the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d either:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(A) cannot be located upon the exercise of duediligence;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(B) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(C) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(D) has been substantially diminished in value; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(E) has been commingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7853(p)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Only if the Government can prove that one of these five conditions was caused by the defendant may it seize \xe2\x80\x9cany other property of the defendant, up to the value of\xe2\x80\x9d the tainted property\xe2\x80\x94rather than the tainted property itself.  \xc2\xa7853(p)(2).  This provision begins from the premise that the defendant once possessed tainted property as \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in subsection (a),\xe2\x80\x9d and provides a means for the Government to recoup the value of the property if it has been dissipated or otherwise disposed of by \xe2\x80\x9cany act or omission of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7853(p)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 853(p)(1) demonstrates that Congress contemplated situations where the tainted property itself would fall outside the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  To remedy that situation, Congress did not authorize the Government to confiscate substitute property from other defendants or co-conspirators; it authorized the Government to confiscate assets only from the defendant who initially acquired the property and who bears responsibility for its dissipation.  Permitting the Government to force other co-conspirators to turn over untainted substitute property would allow the Government to circumvent Congress\xe2\x80\x99 carefully constructed statutory scheme, which permits forfeiture of substitute property only when the requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7853(p) and (a) are satisfied.  There is no basis to read such an end run into the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Against all of this, the Government asserts the \xe2\x80\x9cbedrock principle of conspiracy liability\xe2\x80\x9d under which \xe2\x80\x9cconspirators are legally responsible for each other\xe2\x80\x99s foreseeable actions in furtherance of their common plan.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 9; see also <i>Pinkerton</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 640 (1946)\n.  Congress, according to the Government, must be presumed to have legislated against the background principles of conspiracy liability, and thus, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the traceable proceeds of a conspiracy are unavailable, [\xc2\xa7]853 renders conspirators jointly and severally liable for the amount of the proceeds foreseeably obtained by the conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 10.  Not so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plain text and structure of \xc2\xa7853 leave no doubt that Congress did not incorporate those background principles.  Congress provided just one way for the Government to recoup substitute property when the tainted property itself is unavailable\xe2\x80\x94the procedures outlined in \xc2\xa7853(p).  And, for all the Government makes of the background principles of conspiracy liability, it fails to fully engage with the most important background principles underlying \xc2\xa7853: those of forfeiture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Traditionally, forfeiture was an action against the tainted property itself and thus proceeded <i>in rem</i>; that is,proceedings in which \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he thing [was] primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence [was] attached primarily to the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>The Palmyra</i>, 12 Wheat. 1, 14 (1827).

Congress altered this distinction in enacting \xc2\xa7853 by effectively merging the <i>in rem</i> forfeiture proceeding with the <i>in personam</i> criminal proceeding and by expanding forfeiture to include not just the \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cproperty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. derived from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any proceeds\xe2\x80\x9d of the crime.  \xc2\xa7853(a)(1).  But as is clear from its text and structure, \xc2\xa7853 maintains traditional <i>in rem</i> forfeiture\xe2\x80\x99s focus on tainted property unless one of the preconditions of \xc2\xa7853(p) exists.  For those who find it relevant, the legislative history confirms as much: Congress altered the traditional system in order to \xe2\x80\x9cimprov[e] the procedures applicable in forfeiture cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p. 192 (1983).  By adopting an <i>in personam</i> aspect to criminal forfeiture, and providing for substitute-asset forfeiture, Congress made it easier for the Government to hold the defendant who acquired the tainted property responsible. Congress did not, however, enact any \xe2\x80\x9csignificant expansion of the scope of property subject to forfeiture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Forfeiture pursuant to \xc2\xa7853(a)(1) is limited to property the defendant himself actually acquired as the result of the crime.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a.  The District Court agreed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 40a.  Because Honeycutt never obtained tainted property as a result of the crime, \xc2\xa7853 does not require any forfeiture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare <i>United States</i> v. <i>Van Nguyen</i>, 602 F.\xc2\xa03d 886, 904 (CA8 2010) (applying joint and several liability to forfeiture under \xc2\xa7853); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pitt</i>, 193 F.\xc2\xa03d 751, 765 (CA3 1999) (same); <i>United States</i> v. <i>McHan</i>, 101 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027 (CA4 1996) (same); and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Benevento</i>, 836 F.\xc2\xa02d 129, 130 (CA2 1988) (<i>per curiam</i>) (same), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cano-Flores</i>, 796 F.\xc2\xa03d 83, 91 (CADC 2015) (declining to apply joint and several liability under \xc2\xa7853).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Section 853(o) directs that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of [\xc2\xa7853] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government points to this as license to read joint and several liability into the statute.
