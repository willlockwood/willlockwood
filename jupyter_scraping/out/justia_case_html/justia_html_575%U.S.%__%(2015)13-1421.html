Instead, the debtors argue that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims are not \xe2\x80\x9csecured\xe2\x80\x9d because \xc2\xa7506(a)(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n allowed claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such property\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor\xe2\x80\x99s interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is less than the amount of such allowed claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the value of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s interest here is zero, a straightforward reading of the statute would seem to favor the debtors.

In declining to permit a Chapter 7 debtor to \xe2\x80\x9cstrip down\xe2\x80\x9d a partially underwater lien under \xc2\xa7506(d) to the value of the collateral, the Court in <i>Dewsnup</i> concluded that an allowed claim \xe2\x80\x9csecured by a lien with recourse to the underlying collateral .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not come within the scope of \xc2\xa7506(d).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 415.  Thus, under <i>Dewsnup</i>, a \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d is a claim supported by a security interest in property, regardless of whether the value of that property would be sufficient to cover the claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0This Court declines to limit <i>Dewsnup</i> to partially underwater liens.  <i>Dewsnup</i>\xe2\x80\x99s definition did not depend on such a distinction.  Nor is this distinction supported by <i>Nobelman</i> v. <i>American Savings Bank</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 324\n, which addressed the interaction between the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(a)\xe2\x80\x94a definition that <i>Dewsnup</i> declined to use for purposes of \xc2\xa7506(d)\xe2\x80\x94and an entirely separate provision, \xc2\xa71322(b)(2).

These consolidated cases present the question whether a debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding may void a junior mortgage under \xc2\xa7506(d) when the debt owed on a senior mortgage exceeds the present value of the property.  We hold that a debtor may not, and we therefore reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The facts in these consolidated cases are largely the same.  The debtors, respondents David Caulkett and Edelmiro Toledo-Cardona, each have two mortgage liens on their respective houses.  Petitioner Bank of America (Bank) holds the junior mortgage lien\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, the mortgage lien subordinate to the other mortgage lien\xe2\x80\x94on each home.  The amount owed on each debtor\xe2\x80\x99s senior mortgage lien is greater than each home\xe2\x80\x99s current market value.  The Bank\xe2\x80\x99s junior mortgage liens are thus wholly underwater: because each home is worth less than the amount the debtor owes on the senior mortgage, the Bank would receive nothing if the properties were sold today.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, the debtors each filed for Chapter 7 bank-ruptcy.  In their respective bankruptcy proceedings, they moved to \xe2\x80\x9cstrip off\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or void\xe2\x80\x94the junior mortgage liens under \xc2\xa7506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.

The Eleventh Circuit explained that it was bound by Circuit precedent holding that \xc2\xa7506(d) allows debtors to void a wholly underwater mortgage lien.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now reverse the judgments of the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 506(d) provides, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an <i>allowed secured claim</i>, such lien is void.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Accordingly, \xc2\xa7506(d) permits the debtors here to strip off the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s junior mortgages only if the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94generally, its right to repayment from the debtors, \xc2\xa7101(5)\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cnot an allowed secured claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subject to some exceptions not relevant here, a claim filed by a creditor is deemed \xe2\x80\x9callowed\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502 if no interested party objects or if, in the case of an objection, the Bankruptcy Court determines that the claim should be allowed under the Code.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  The parties agree that the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims meet this requirement.  They disagree, however, over whether the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims are \xe2\x80\x9csecured\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7506(d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Code suggests that the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims are not secured.  Section 506(a)(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a <i>secured claim</i> to the extent of the value of such creditor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such property,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can <i>unsecured claim</i> to the extent that the value of such creditor\xe2\x80\x99s interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is less than the amount of such allowed claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  In other words, if the value of a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s interest inthe property is zero\xe2\x80\x94as is the case here\xe2\x80\x94his claim cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7506(a).  And given that these identical words are later used in the same section of the same Act\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa7506(d)\xe2\x80\x94one would think this \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a classic case for application of the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Desert Palace, Inc. </i>v. <i>Costa</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 90,\n101 (2003)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under that straightforward reading of the statute, the debtors would be able to void the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unfortunately for the debtors, this Court has already adopted a construction of the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) that forecloses this textual analysis.  See <i>Dewsnup </i>v. <i>Timm</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410 (1992)\n.  In <i>Dewsnup</i>, the Court confronted a situation in which a Chapter 7 debtor wanted to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strip down\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or reduce\xe2\x80\x94a partially underwater lien under \xc2\xa7506(d) to the value of the collateral.  <i>Id.,</i> at 412\xe2\x80\x93413.  Specifically, she sought, under \xc2\xa7506(d), to reduce her debt of approximately $120,000 to the value of the collateral securing her debt at that time ($39,000).  <i>Id.,</i> at 413.  Relying on the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98allowed secured claim\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(a), she contended that her creditors\xe2\x80\x99 claim was \xe2\x80\x9csecured only to the extent of the judicially determined value of the real property on which the lien [wa]s fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 414.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court rejected her argument.  Rather than apply the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(a), the Court reasoned that the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) contained an ambiguity because the self-interested parties before it disagreed over the term\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  <i>Id.,</i> at 416, 420.  Relying on policy considerations and its understanding of pre-Code practice, the Court concluded that if a claim \xe2\x80\x9chas been \xe2\x80\x98allowed\xe2\x80\x99 pursuant to \xc2\xa7502 of the Code and is secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying collateral, it does not come within the scope of \xc2\xa7506(d).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 415; see <i>id.,</i> at 417\xe2\x80\x93420.  It therefore held that the debtor could not strip down the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 lien to the value of the property under \xc2\xa7506(d) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [the creditors\xe2\x80\x99] claim [wa]s secured by a lien and ha[d] been fully allowed pursuant to \xc2\xa7502.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 417.  In other words, <i>Dewsnup</i> defined the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) to mean a claim supported by a security interest in property, regardless of whether the value of that property would be sufficient to cover the claim.  Under this definition, \xc2\xa7506(d)\xe2\x80\x99s function is reduced to \xe2\x80\x9cvoiding a lien whenever a claim secured by the lien itself has not been allowed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 416.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Dewsnup</i>\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d resolves<i> </i>the question presented here.  <i>Dewsnup</i> construed the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) to include any claim \xe2\x80\x9csecured by a lien and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fully allowed pursuant to \xc2\xa7502.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 417.  Because the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s claims here are both secured by liens and allowed under \xc2\xa7502, they cannot be voided under the definition given to the term \xe2\x80\x9callowed secured claim\xe2\x80\x9d by <i>Dewsnup</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The debtors do not ask us to overrule <i>Dewsnup</i>,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]\xe2\x80\xa0 but instead request that we limit that decision to partially\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to wholly\xe2\x80\x94underwater liens.  We decline to adopt this distinction.  The debtors offer several reasons why we should cabin <i>Dewsnup </i>in this manner, but none of them is compelling.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To start, the debtors rely on language in <i>Dewsnup</i> stating that the Court was not addressing \xe2\x80\x9call possible fact situations,\xe2\x80\x9d but was instead \xe2\x80\x9callow[ing] other facts to await their legal resolution on another day.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 416\xe2\x80\x93417. But this disclaimer provides an insufficient foundation for the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 proposed distinction.  <i>Dewsnup </i>considered several possible definitions of the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d).  See <i>id.,</i> at 414\xe2\x80\x93416.  The definition it settled on\xe2\x80\x94that a claim is \xe2\x80\x9csecured\xe2\x80\x9d if it is \xe2\x80\x9csecured by a lien\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas been fully allowed pursuant to \xc2\xa7502,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 417\xe2\x80\x94does not depend on whether a lien is partially or wholly underwater.  Whatever the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hedging language meant, it does not provide a reason to limit <i>Dewsnup</i> in the manner the debtors propose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The debtors next contend that the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) could be redefined as any claim that is backed by collateral with <i>some</i> value.  Embracing this reading of \xc2\xa7506(d), however, would give the term \xe2\x80\x9callowed secured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) a different meaning than its statutory definition in \xc2\xa7506(a).  We refuse to adopt this artificial definition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do we think <i>Nobelman </i>v. <i>American Savings Bank</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 324 (1993)\n, supports the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 proposed distinction.  <i>Nobelman</i> said nothing about the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d).  Instead, it addressed the interaction between the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(a) and an entirely separate provision, \xc2\xa71322(b)(2).  See 508 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 327\xe2\x80\x93332.  <i>Nobelman</i> offers no guidance on the question presented in these cases because the Court in <i>Dewsnup</i> already declined to apply the definition in \xc2\xa7506(a) to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The debtors alternatively urge us to limit <i>Dewsnup</i>\xe2\x80\x99s definition to the facts of that case because the historical and policy concerns that motivated the Court do not apply in the context of wholly underwater liens.  Whether or not that proposition is true, it is an insufficient justification for giving the term \xe2\x80\x9csecured claim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7506(d) a different definition depending on the value of the collateral.  We are generally reluctant to give the \xe2\x80\x9csame words a different meaning\xe2\x80\x9d when construing statutes, <i>Pasquantino </i>v.<i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349,\n358 (2005)\n (internal quotation marks omitted), and we decline to do so here based on policy arguments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, embracing the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 distinction would not vindicate \xc2\xa7506(d)\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning, and it would leave an odd statutory framework in its place.  Under the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 approach, if a court valued the collateral at one dollar more than the amount of a senior lien, the debtor could not strip down a junior lien under <i>Dewsnup</i>, but if it valued the property at one dollar less, the debtor could strip off the entire junior lien.  Given the constantly shifting value of real property, this reading could lead to arbitrary results.  To be sure, the Code engages in line-drawing elsewhere, and sometimes a dollar\xe2\x80\x99s difference will have a significant impact on bankruptcy proceedings.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(i) (presumption of abuse of provisions of Chapter 7 triggered if debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income over the next five years is $12,475).  But these lines were set by Congress, not this Court.  There is scant support for the view that \xc2\xa7506(d) applies differently depending on whether a lien was partially or wholly underwater.

The debtors here have not asked us to overrule <i>Dewsnup</i>, and we decline to adopt the artificial distinction they propose instead.
