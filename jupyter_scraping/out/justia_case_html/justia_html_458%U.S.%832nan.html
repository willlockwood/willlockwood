The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that the gross receipts tax imposed by the State of New Mexico was permissible.

Ramah Navajo children attended a small public high school near the reservation until the State closed this facility in 1968.  Because there were no other public high schools reasonably close to the reservation, the Ramah Navajo children were forced either to abandon their high school education or to attend federal Indian boarding schools far from the reservation.  In 1970, the Ramah Navajo Chapter exercised its authority under Navajo Tribal Code, Title 10, \xc2\xa7 51 (1969), and established its own school board in order to remedy this situation.  Appellant Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc. (the Board), was organized as a nonprofit corporation to be operated exclusively by members of the Ramah Navajo Chapter.  The Board is a Navajo "tribal organization" within the meaning of 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 450b(c), 88 Stat. 2204.  With funds provided by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Navajo Indian Tribe, the Board operated a school in the abandoned public school facility, thus creating the first independent Indian school in modern times. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="835">Page 458 U. S. 835</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1972, the Board successfully solicited from Congress funds for the design of new school facilities.  Pub.L. 9269, 86 Stat. 510.  The Board then contracted with the BIA for the design of the new school and hired an architect.  In 1974, the Board contracted with the BIA for the actual construction of the new school to be built on reservation land.  Funding for the construction of this facility was provided by a series of congressional appropriations specifically earmarked for this purpose. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The contract specified that the Board was the design and building contractor for the project, but that the Board could subcontract the actual construction work to third parties.  The contract further provided that any subcontracting agreement would have to include certain clauses governing pricing, wages, bonding, and the like, and that it must be approved by the BIA.</p>\n<p>The Board then solicited bids from area building contractors for the construction of the school, and received bids from two non-Indian firms.  Each firm included the state gross receipts tax as a cost of construction in their bids, although the tax was not itemized separately.  Appellant Lembke Construction Co. (Lembke) was the low bidder, and was awarded the contract.  The contract between the Board and Lembke provides that Lembke is to pay all "taxes required by law."  Lembke began construction of the school facilities in 1974, and continued this work for over five years.  During that time, Lembke paid the gross receipts tax and, pursuant to standard industry practice, was reimbursed by the Board for the full amount paid.  Before the second contract between Lembke and the Board was executed in 1977, a clause was inserted into the contract recognizing that the Board could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="836">Page 458 U. S. 836</a></p><p> litigate the validity of this tax and was entitled to any refund.  Both Lembke and the Board protested the imposition of the gross receipts tax.  In 1978, after exhausting administrative remedies, they filed this refund action against appellee New Mexico Bureau of Revenue in the New Mexico District Court.  At the time of trial, the parties stipulated that the Board had reimbursed Lembke for tax payments of $232,264.38, and that the Board would receive any refund that might be awarded.</p>\n<p>The trial court entered judgment for the State Bureau of Revenue.  After noting that the "legal incidence" of the tax fell on the non-Indian construction firm, the court rejected appellants\' arguments that the tax was preempted by comprehensive federal regulation and that it imposed an impermissible burden on tribal sovereignty.  The Court of Appeals for the State of New Mexico affirmed.  95 N.M. 708, 625 P.2d 1225 (1980).  Although acknowledging that the economic burden of the tax fell on the Board, the Court of Appeals concluded that the tax was not preempted by federal law and that it did not unlawfully burden tribal sovereignty.  The Board filed a petition for rehearing in light of this Court\'s intervening decisions in <em>White Mountain, supra,</em> and <em>Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona State Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/160/case.html">448 U. S. 160</a></span> (1980).  The Court of Appeals denied the petition, stating only that this case did not involve either "a comprehensive or pervasive scheme of federal regulation" or "federal regulation similar to the Indian trader statutes."  App. to Juris.Statement 36.  After initially granting discretionary review, the New Mexico Supreme Court quashed the writ as improvidently granted.  96 N.M. 17, 627 P.2d 412 (1981).

Although there is no definitive formula for resolving the question whether a State may exercise its authority over tribal members or reservation activities, we have recently identified the relevant federal, tribal, and state interests to be considered in determining whether a particular exercise of state authority violates federal law.  <em>See White Mountain,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#141">448 U. S. 141</a></span>-145.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>White Mountain,</em> we recognized that the federal and tribal interests arise from the broad power of Congress to regulate tribal affairs under the Indian Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, and from the semi-autonomous status of Indian tribes.  448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#142">448 U. S. 142</a></span>.  These interests tend to erect two "independent but related" barriers to the exercise of state authority over commercial activity on an Indian reservation:  state authority may be preempted by federal law, or it may interfere with the tribe\'s ability to exercise its sovereign functions.  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing, <em>inter alia, Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/685/case.html">380 U. S. 685</a></span> (1965); <em>McClanahan v.

As we explained in <em>White Mountain:</em></p>\n<p>"The two barriers are independent because either, standing alone, can be a sufficient basis for holding state law inapplicable to activity undertaken on the reservation or by tribal members.  They are related, however, in two important ways.  The right of tribal self-government is ultimately dependent on and subject to the broad power of Congress.  Even so, traditional notions of Indian self-government are so deeply engrained in our jurisprudence that they have provided an important \'backdrop,\' . . . against which vague or ambiguous federal enactments must always be measured."</p>\n<p>448 U.S. at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="838">Page 458 U.

We found the federal regulatory scheme for harvesting Indian timber to be so pervasive that it precluded the imposition of additional burdens by the relevant state taxes.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#148">448 U.

In particular, the Secretary and the BIA extensively regulated the contractual relationship between the Indians and the non-Indians working on the reservation:  they established the bidding procedure, set mandatory terms to be included in every contract, and required that all contracts be approved by the Secretary.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#147">448 U.

We concluded that the imposition of state taxes would also undermine the Secretary\'s ability to carry out his obligations to set fees and rates for the harvesting and sale of the timber, and it would impede the "Tribe\'s ability to comply with the sustained-yield management policies imposed by federal law."  448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#149">448 U.

In this context, this interest is insufficient to justify the State\'s intrusion into a sphere so heavily regulated by the Federal Government.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>This case is indistinguishable in all relevant respects from <em>White Mountain.</em>  Federal regulation of the construction and financing of Indian educational institutions is both comprehensive and pervasive.  The Federal Government\'s concern with the education of Indian children can be traced back to the first treaties between the United States and the Navajo Tribe. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Since that time, Congress has enacted numerous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="840">Page 458 U. S. 840</a></p><p> statutes empowering the BIA to provide for Indian education both on and off the reservation.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Snyder Act, 42 Stat. 208 (1921), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13; Johnson-O\'Malley Act, 48 Stat. 596 (1934), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 452 <em>et seq.;</em> Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act, 64 Stat. 44 (1950), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 631 <em>et seq.;</em> Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 88 Stat. 2203 (1975), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 450 <em>et seq.</em> (Self-Determination Act).  Although the early focus of the federal efforts in this area concentrated on providing federal or state educational facilities for Indian children, in the early 1970\'s, the federal policy shifted toward encouraging the development of Indian-controlled institutions on the reservation.  <em>See</em> 6 Weekly Comp. of Pres.Doc. 894, 899-900 (1970) (Message of President Nixon).</p>\n<p>This federal policy has been codified in the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 77, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1451 <em>et seq.,</em> and most notably in the Self-Determination Act.  The Self-Determination Act declares that a</p>\n<p>"major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic wellbeing."</p>\n<p>88 Stat. 2203, as set forth in 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 450a(c).  In achieving this goal, Congress expressly recognized that "parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people."  88 Stat. 2203, as set forth in 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 450(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Section 450k empowers the Secretary to promulgate regulations to accomplish the purposes of the Act.  88 Stat. 2212, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 450k.  Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary has promulgated detailed and comprehensive regulations respecting "school construction for previously private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="841">Page 458 U. S. 841</a></p><p> schools now controlled and operated by tribes or tribally approved Indian organizations."  25 CFR \xc2\xa7 274.1 (1981).  Under these regulations, the BIA has wide-ranging authority to monitor and review the subcontracting agreements between the Indian organization, which is viewed as the general contractor, and the non-Indian firm that actually constructs the facilities.  <em>See</em> 25 CFR \xc2\xa7 274.2 (1981).

I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, to hold that on-reservation activities involving a resident tribe are presumptively beyond the reach of state law even in the absence of comprehensive federal regulation, thus placing the burden on the State to demonstrate that its intrusion is either condoned by Congress or justified by a compelling need to protect legitimate, specified state interests other than the generalized desire to collect revenue.  He argues that adopting this approach is preferable for several reasons:  it would provide guidance to the state courts addressing these issues, thus reducing the need for our case-by-case review of these decisions; it would avoid the tension </p><p><a class="page-number" name="846">Page 458 U.

Although clearer rules and presumptions promote the interest in simplifying litigation, our precedents announcing the scope of preemption analysis in this area provide sufficient guidance to state courts and also allow for more flexible consideration of the federal, state, and tribal interests at issue.

S. 851</a></span>.  The dissent fails to explain, however, how this fact distinguishes this case from <em>White Mountain.</em>  In that case, we struck down Arizona\'s use fuel tax and motor carrier license tax not because of any federal interest in gasoline, licenses, or highways, but because the imposition of these state taxes on a non-Indian contractor doing work on the reservation was preempted by the "comprehensive regulation of the harvesting and sale of tribal timber."  448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#151">448 U. S. 151</a></span>.  We find that New Mexico is similarly precluded from impeding the federal interest in the construction of autonomous Indian educational institutions by imposing its gross receipts tax on Lembke.  JUSTICE REHNQUIST\'s contention that the New Mexico tax is somehow compatible with this federal interest because such taxes "are as much a normal cost of school construction as the cost of cement and labor," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#855">458 U. S. 855</a></span>, is also foreclosed by <em>White Mountain.</em>  Surely, state use fuel and motor carrier license taxes are considered part of the cost of harvesting and marketing timber.  Yet in <em>White Mountain,</em> we concluded that these taxes impeded the federal interest in "guaranteeing Indians that they will <em>receive . . . the benefit of whatever profit [the forest] is capable of yielding,\'" 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#149">448 U. S. 149</a></span>, despite the dissent\'s argument that the taxes amounted to less than 1% of the annual profits produced by the logging operation.  Here, as in <em>White Mountain,</em> JUSTICE REHNQUIST continues to press this argument.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellee would have us impute congressional awareness and approval of the state gross receipts tax from appropriations bills which earmarked funds for the construction of these facilities, <em>see</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  Brief for Appellee 21-22.  Appellee strains to find this awareness and approval by arguing that the same architects who prepared the cost estimates and requests that the Board submitted to Congress also prepared the bid specifications pursuant to which Lembke submitted its bid.  However, as we have indicated, the bid specifications only required prospective bidders to include "all taxes required by law," and the submitted bids did not specify the gross receipts tax as a separate line item.  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#835">458 U. S. 835</a></span>.  Therefore, it is by no means clear, and the Board disputes the contention, that the Board ever intended to have these state taxes included in the construction costs of its school facilities.  Furthermore, there is absolutely no indication that Congress was even made aware of the existence of these taxes when it appropriated funds for the construction of the Ramah Navajo school.  In any event, as we have noted in a related context, courts should be wary of inferring congressional intent to alter the force of existing law from an appropriations Act.  <em>Cf. TVA v.

Indeed, the Self-Determination Act specifically authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with any State willing to construct educational institutions for Indian children on or near the reservation.  88 Stat. 2214, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 458.  This case would be different if the State were actively seeking tax revenues for the purpose of constructing, or assisting in the effort to provide, adequate educational facilities for Ramah Navajo children.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Revenue invites us to adopt the "legal incidence" test, under which the legal incidence and not the actual burden of the tax would control the preemption inquiry.  Of course, in some contexts, the fact that the legal incidence of the tax falls on a non-Indian is significant.  <em>See Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/134/case.html">447 U.

S. 151</a></span>, we found it significant that the economic burden of the asserted taxes would ultimately fall on the Tribe, even though the legal incidence of the tax was on the non-Indian logging company.  Given the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme at issue here, we decline to allow the State to impose additional burdens on the significant federal interest in fostering Indian-run educational institutions, even if those burdens are imposed indirectly through a tax on a non-Indian contractor for work done on the reservation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Central Machinery Co. v.

Presumably, the state tax revenues derived from Lembke\'s off-reservation business activities are adequate to reimburse the State for the services it provides to Lembke.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>We are similarly unpersuaded by the State\'s argument that the significant services it provides to the Ramah Navajo Indians justify the imposition of this tax.  The State does not suggest that these benefits are in any way related to the construction of schools on Indian land.  Furthermore, the evidence introduced below by the State on this issue is far from clear.  Although the State does provide services to the Ramah Navajo Indians, it receives federal funds for providing some of these services, and the State conceded at trial that it saves approximately $380,000 by not having to provide education for the Ramah Navajo children.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I do not think the Court of Appeals deserves the rebuke; it seems to me that the state court applied our precedents at least as faithfully, and coherently, as the Court itself.  In its desire to reach a result that it evidently finds quite salutary as a matter of policy, the Court finds "indistinguishable" a case that is considerably off the mark, and it finds "pervasively regulated" an activity that is largely free of federal regulation.  It ultimately accords a dependent Indian tribal organization greater tax immunity than it accorded the sovereignty of the United States a short three months ago in a case involving the precise state taxes at issue here.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The general question presented by this case has occupied the Court many times in the recent past, and seems destined to demand its attention over and over again until the Court sees fit to articulate, and follow, a consistent and predictable rule of law.  This insistent question concerns the extent to which the States can tax economic activity on Indian reservations within their borders.  I believe the dominant trend of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="848">Page 458 U. S. 848</a></p><p> our cases is toward treating the scope of reservation immunity from nondiscriminatory state taxation as a question of preemption, ultimately dependent on congressional intent.  In such a framework, the tradition of Indian sovereignty stands as an independent barrier to discriminatory taxes, and otherwise serves only as a guide to the ascertainment of the congressional will.</p>\n<p>The principles announced in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html">448 U. S. 136</a></span> (1980), are consistent with this trend. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Thus, the Court in <em>White Mountain</em> recognized federal preemption as a principal barrier to the assertion of state regulatory authority over tribal reservations and members, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#142">448 U.

The Court also recognized that, in some instances, a state law may be invalid because it infringes "<em>the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#142">448 U.

But apart from those rare instances in which the State attempts to interfere with the residual sovereignty of a tribe to govern its own members, the "tradition of tribal sovereignty" merely provides a "backdrop" against which the preemptive effect of federal statutes or treaties must be assessed.  <em>See</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#143">448 U.

This statement is quite inaccurate.  <em>White Mountain</em> involved an attempt by the State of Arizona to apply its motor carrier license and use fuel taxes to the logging operations of a non-Indian company doing business exclusively on the reservation.  The Court concluded that application of the State\'s taxes was inconsistent with the pervasive federal regulation of the very activity subject to taxation.  The Court repeatedly emphasized the comprehensiveness of the regulations on which it relied.</p>\n<p>"Under these regulations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs exercises literally daily supervision over the harvesting and management of tribal timber.

S. 841</a></span>, the regulations also authorize the BIA to approve or disapprove plans and specifications for construction as well as construction contracts let by the tribe, which are treated as subcontracts of the funding contract between the tribe and the BIA.  The contracts are required to contain a clause establishing a hiring preference for Indians.  \xc2\xa7 274.38.  And the BIA is given access to the tribe\'s records for auditing purposes.  \xc2\xa7 274.41.

In <em>White Mountain,</em> the Court engaged in a detailed examination of the extent to which state taxes would interfere both with the Secretary\'s ability to carry out his congressional mandate and with the tribe\'s ability to carry out federal policy.  In the place of such careful analysis, the Court today relies on <em>ipse dixit.</em>  It does so because there is no realistic basis for concluding that the State\'s taxes would interfere with a "pervasive" regulatory scheme.  The BIA simply does not regulate the construction activity which the State seeks to tax.  It provides federal money to eligible tribes and tribal organizations and it establishes a contract approval and auditing mechanism as a means of attempting to ensure that the money is put to the use for which it is earmarked.

Whether the federal regulations are detailed and comprehensive or largely a matter of bookkeeping is an irrelevancy, for the Court concludes that the tax burden</p>\n<p>"impedes the clearly expressed federal interest in promoting the \'quality and quantity\' of educational opportunities for Indians <em>by depleting the funds available for the construction of Indian schools.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#842">458 U.

As the Court in <em>White Mountain</em> recognized, our precedents undeniably view that as an insufficient basis for the recognition of an Indian tax immunity.  <em>See Washington v.

But it is a considerable leap to infer from that policy the independent principle that all state laws which might increase the cost of such an endeavor are to be considered null and void.  It is perfectly conceivable that Congress favored Indian education, but also contemplated that all costs of obtaining that end would be paid in a normal fashion.  State taxes are as much a normal cost of school construction as the cost of cement and labor.  The cost of taxes was included in the bids submitted to the Board by the construction contractors, and it apparently was also included in the funding requests submitted by the Board to Congress.  The Board cannot be faulted for attempting to stretch its federal construction funds as far as possible, but that is a woefully inadequate basis for interfering with the sovereign prerogatives of the State of New Mexico.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>A short three months ago, this Court considered whether the State of New Mexico could impose its gross receipts and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="856">Page 458 U. S. 856</a></p><p> compensating use taxes on private contractors that conduct business with the Federal Government.  We concluded that tax immunity was appropriate in only one circumstance:</p>\n<p>"when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. New Mexico,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/720/case.html">455 U.

In reaching this conclusion, we held that</p>\n<p>"immunity may not be conferred simply because the tax has an effect on the United States, or even because the Federal Government shoulders the entire economic burden of the levy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/720/case.html#734">455 U. S. 734</a></span>.  If the legal incidence of the tax is on the contractor, it is to be considered valid, absent specific congressional action, as long as "the contractors can realistically be considered entities independent of the United States."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/720/case.html#738">455 U. S. 738</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, as in <em>United States v. New Mexico,</em> the legal incidence of the New Mexico tax is on the private contractor, not on the entity whose status might be the source of a tax immunity.  And, as in <em>United States v. New Mexico,</em> it is evident that Lembke is a separate taxable entity completely independent of the tribal school board.  Were the tax immunity of the Tribe no greater than that of the United States, it seems plain that New Mexico\'s tax would have to be upheld as applied to the gross receipts of the non-Indian contractor.  But the Court reaches a different conclusion because it finds that the tax imposes an economic burden on the Tribe\'s effort to build a school with federal funds.  Thus, the Court accords </p><p><a class="page-number" name="857">Page 458 U. S. 857</a></p><p> an Indian Tribe, whose sovereignty "exists only at the sufferance of Congress and is subject to complete defeasance," <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I dissent from the Court\'s judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Although we must admit our disappointment that the courts below apparently gave short shrift to this principle and to our precedents in this area, we cannot and do not presume that state courts will not follow both the letter and the spirit of our decisions in the future."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#846">458 U.

The same suggestion was urged, and rejected, in <em>White Mountain.</em>  It has proved no more appealing in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court ignores other distinctions between this case and <em>White Mountain.</em>  For example, the logging contractor in the latter case, although a non-Indian corporation, operated exclusively to harvest timber on the reservation; it conducted no off-reservation activities whatsoever.  <em>See</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#139">448 U. S. 139</a></span>.  The contractor in this case is a general building contractor doing business throughout the State of New Mexico, and enjoying state services to the same extent as any other commercial enterprise in New Mexico.  The Court dismisses this factor with the statement that,</p>\n<p>"[p]resumably, the state tax revenues derived from Lembke\'s off-reservation business activities are adequate to reimburse the State for the services it provides to Lembke."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#844">458 U. S. 844</a></span>, n. 9.  The Court\'s "presumptions," however, are no substitute for the considered judgment of the state taxing authority.  Indeed, in assessing the validity of a state tax, the Court has previously recognized that the State\'s interests are strongest when the taxpayer is the recipient of state services.  <em>See Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/134/case.html">447 U. S. 134</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/10/case.html#15">447 U. S. 15</a></span> (1980).  To the extent presumptions are relevant, the Court has inverted the one that ought to apply.</p>\n<p>Another distinction is also relevant.  The activity taxed in <em>White Mountain</em> was the exploitation of natural resources located on the reservation and devoted to the beneficial use and enjoyment of reservation Indians.  Indeed, over 90% of the total profits generated by tribal enterprises were derived from the Tribe\'s logging operations.  448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#138">448 U. S. 138</a></span>.  In this case, the state taxes diminish not the income generated by the Tribe for its own preservation and welfare, but federal funds appropriated by Congress for the purpose of school construction.  No tribal funds are devoted to this endeavor, and congressional appropriations were based on funding requests that included the gross receipts tax as part of the estimated construction cost.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>In other areas of tax immunity, the Court has steadfastly refused to assess the validity of a tax by reference to the economic burdens it imposes if those burdens are nondiscriminatory and comport with due process.  <em>See United States v.

But the immunity of federal contractors from state taxes is also dependent on "generalized notions of federal supremacy."  <em>United States v. New Mexico, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/720/case.html#730">455 U. S. 730</a></span>.  The critical question, both in <em>United States v. New Mexico</em> and in this case, is what factors will the Court examine to determine whether the State has exceeded limits imposed by the Supremacy Clause and by Congress.  I think it is evident that, in the area of federal tax immunity, the Court has required evidence of more than mere economic burdens before it will invalidate a state tax as applied.  As this case demonstrates, tribal tax immunity may be invoked on no greater showing than the fact of economic burdens on a federally supported tribal endeavor.  Since both immunities derive from precisely the same source -- the supremacy of federal law -- I find the Court\'s decision today inexplicable.</p>\n<p>"With the abandonment of the notion that the economic -- as opposed to the legal -- incidence of the tax is relevant, it becomes difficult to maintain that federal tax immunity is designed to insulate federal operations from the effects of state taxation."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.
