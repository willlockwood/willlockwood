The question presented in this case is whether a suit brought by a local union against its parent international union, alleging a violation of the international\'s constitution, falls within \xc2\xa7 301(a) jurisdiction of the federal district courts.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Local 334, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada (Local 334 or respondent), was a labor organization chartered by and affiliated with petitioner United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada (International or United Association), an international labor organization. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Composed of both plumbers and pipefitters in Morris County, N.J., Local 334 was one of 27 New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 452 U. S. 617</a></p><p> Jersey locals affiliated with the International prior to 1977.  After failing in its attempt to urge the New Jersey locals to agree upon a voluntary consolidation plan, the International proposed its own plan that would consolidate nine northern New Jersey locals, including Local 334, into two locals, one representing plumbers, the other pipefitters. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Under the plan, the plumber members of Local 334 would be transferred into Plumbers Local 14, and the pipefitter members of Local 334 into Pipefitters Local 274.</p>\n<p>When the locals declined to agree to the International\'s plan, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the International issued an order of consolidation on August 4, 1977, based on the proposed plan, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 86 of the constitution of the United Association.  That section, entitled "Consolidation of Locals," provides:</p>\n<p>"Whenever, in the judgment of the General President, it is apparent that there is a superfluous number of Local Unions in any locality, and that a consolidation would be for the best interest of the United Association, locally or at large, he shall have the power to order Local Unions to consolidate and to enforce the consolidation of said Local Unions, or said territory in one or more Local Unions, provided such course received the sanction of the General Executive Board."</p>\n<p>App. 25.</p>\n<p>After receiving no response to a letter sent to the General Executive Board requesting a stay of the order pending appeal, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 452 U. S. 618</a></p><p> Local 334, on August 22, 1977, filed suit against the International in the Superior Court of New Jersey seeking to enjoin enforcement of the order of consolidation.  Local 334 alleged in its complaint, <em>inter alia,</em> that \xc2\xa7 86 did not permit division of the membership of a local into separate work classifications, that the action of United Association did not constitute a consolidation of local unions, and that the general president had abused his discretion. Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 11, <em>id.</em> at 21.  Claiming that it would suffer "substantial and irreparable injury to plaintiffs\' [<em>sic</em>] property and property rights as members of Local 334" unless the consolidation was prevented, Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 13, <em>id.</em> at 21, the Local requested equitable relief enjoining United Association to return the Local\'s charter and seal, directing it to process the Local\'s internal appeal to the International\'s General Executive Board, and preventing it from threatening the Local\'s officers and members with expulsion and loss of membership.  <em>Id.</em> at 22. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The International removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Local 334 filed a motion to remand the case to the state court, which the District Court denied.  App. 98-99.  Following completion of discovery and cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled in favor of the International.  The court first concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the Local had failed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="619">Page 452 U. S. 619</a></p><p> to exhaust internal union remedies.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a-23a.  In the alternative, the court ruled on the merits that there was</p>\n<p>"ample basis for the [International\'s] interpretation of the Constitution, as well as the application of that interpretation in the Order of Consolidation of August 4, 1977."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 28a.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, <em>sua sponte,</em> raised the question of federal court jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 301(a) and requested supplemental briefing on that issue from the parties.  628 F.2d 812, 813 (1980).  After canvassing treatment of this issue by other Courts of Appeals, the court held that</p>\n<p>"[s]uits concerning intra-union matters that do not have a significant impact on labor-management relations or industrial peace are outside the scope of \xc2\xa7 301(a)."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 820.  Examining Local 334\'s allegations in its complaint, the court concluded that any alleged potential effect of the order of consolidation on labor-management relations or industrial peace would not pass the "significant impact" test, and that the District Court therefore lacked jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 301(a).  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the court vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded with instructions to remand the case to the state court.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted the International\'s petition for certiorari, 449 U.S. 1123 (1981), to resolve this important question of labor law.  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 301(a) establishes federal district court jurisdiction for</p>\n<p>"[s]uits for violation of contracts . . . between any . . . labor organizations [representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter]."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185(a).  On its face, the statute appears to comprehend the instant dispute.  First, United Association\'s constitution may be fairly characterized as a contract between labor organizations.  We have described a union constitution as a "fundamental agreement of association."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/295/case.html">Cororlado Coal Co. v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 452 U.

The Courts of Appeals are unnimous that a union contitution can be a "contract between labor organizations" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 301(a).  <em>See, e.g., Alexander v. International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO,</em> 624 F.2d 1235, 1238 (CA5 1980); <em>Studio Electrical Technicians Local 728 v.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]   </p><p><a class="page-number" name="621">Page 452 U. S. 621</a></p><p> Indeed, even the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on review here recognized that a union constitution would be a "contract" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 301(a) as long as the plaintiff made "specific factual allegations of actions which have a significant impact on labor-management relations or industrial peace."  628 F.2d at 820. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  And respondent, in its complaint, alleged that "[t]he relationship (rights and duties) between Local 334 and the International is governed by the said Constitution."  Amended Complaint, First Count \xef\xbf\xbd 3, App. 55.</p>\n<p>We have also noted that the prevailing state law view is that a union constitution is a contract.  <em>Machinists v.

In particular, the view of a union constitution as a contract between parent and local unions was widely held in the States around the time \xc2\xa7 301(a) was enacted.  <em>See, e.g., Locals 1140 and 1145 v.

As defined in the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152 (5), the term "labor organization" means</p>\n<p>"any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work."</p>\n<p>We have entertained numerous cases brought under \xc2\xa7 301(a) where one of the parties was an international union, <em>see, e.g., Automobile Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html">383 U. S. 696</a></span> (1966) or a local union, <em>see, e.g., Drake Bakeries, Inc. v. Bakery &amp; Confectioner Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/254/case.html">370 U. S. 254</a></span> (1962).  Indeed, in <em>Carbon Fuel Co. v.

S. 214</a></span>.</p>\n<p>If the plain meaning of the "contracts between labor organizations" clause of \xc2\xa7 301(a) supports jurisdiction in the instant case, its legislative history hardly upsets such an interpretation.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 452 U. S. 623</a></p><p> That is because there is no specific legislative history on that phrase to explain what Congress meant.  The provision for suits between labor organizations was inserted late in the bill\'s history by the House-Senate Conference Committee.  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 6566 (1947), 1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, pp. 569-570 (hereafter Leg.Hist.); 93 Cong.Rec. 6445 (1947); 2 Leg.Hist., at 1535, 1543; <em>see Retail Clerks v.

The Conference Report and post-conference debates contain no explanatory remarks about this addition.  The only reference to the clause was made in a summary of the Act prepared by Senator Taft and inserted in the Congressional Record, which merely recited:</p>\n<p>"Section 301 differs from the Senate bill in two respects.  Subsection(a) provides that suits for violation of contracts between labor organizations, as well as between a labor organization and an employer, may be brought in the Federal courts."</p>\n<p>93 Cong.Rec. 6445 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. at 1543.</p>\n<p>Relying primarily on decisions from other Courts of Appeals, the Court of Appeals below was</p>\n<p>"persuaded by the view that disputes between local and parent unions must involve events which potentially have a significant impact on labor-management relations or industrial peace in order for there to be jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 301(a)."</p>\n<p>628 F.2d at 818.  It is no doubt true that the primary purpose of the Taft-Hartley Act was "to promote the achievement of industrial peace through encouragement and refinement of the collective bargaining process."  <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Cortney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html">368 U.

As the Senate observed,</p>\n<p>"[s]tatutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract . . . will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial peace."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

S. 624</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But apparently Congress was also concerned that unions be made legally accountable for agreements into which they entered among themselves, an objective that itself would further stability among labor organizations.  Therefore, \xc2\xa7 301(a) provided federal jurisdiction for enforcement of contracts made by labor organizations to counteract jurisdictional defects in many state courts that made it difficult or impossible to bring suits against labor organizations by reason of their status as unincorporated associations.  <em>See Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html#510">368 U. S. 510</a></span>; 93 Cong.Rec. 5014 (1947) (comments of Sen. Ball, a floor leader of the bill) ("because unions are voluntary associations, the common law in a great many States requires service on every member of the union, which is very difficult"); [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] S.Rep.

Surely Congress could conclude that the enforcement of the terms of union constitutions -- documents that prescribe the legal relationship and the rights and obligations between the parent and affiliated locals -- would contribute to the achievement of labor stability.  Since union constitutions were probably the most commonplace form of contract between labor organizations when the Taft-Hartley Act was enacted (and probably still are today), and Congress was obviously familiar with their existence and importance, we cannot believe that Congress would have used the unqualified term "contract" without intending to encompass that category of contracts represented by union constitutions.  Nothing in the language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 301(a) suggests any special qualification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="625">Page 452 U. S. 625</a></p><p> or limitation on its reach, and we decline to interpose one ourselves. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent goes even further than the Court of Appeals\' view that only disputes with a "significant impact" on labor-management relations should trigger \xc2\xa7 301(a) jurisdiction, arguing that \xc2\xa7 301(a) should never extend to disputes arising under union constitutions because "[t]he 80th Congress clearly did not intend to intervene in the internal affairs of labor unions."  Brief for Respondent 16-17.  In support of its position, respondent cites several provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] some general statements in the legislative history, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and our decision in <em>NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/175/case.html">388 U. S. 175</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/175/case.html#184">388 U.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters,</em> 542 F.2d 961, 968 (CA6 1976).</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds today that union constitutions are "contracts between . . . labor organizations" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185(a).  To reach this result, the Court claims to rely on the plain meaning of the statute, uncontradicted by the legislative history.  Unlike the Court, I cannot construe these simple English words in such a convoluted fashion.  To me, it is abundantly clear that a union constitution is not a contract between labor organizations, and the legislative history confirms that this reading comports with Congress\' intent in adopting the Act.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court, of course, that a union and its locals are "labor organizations" as defined by \xc2\xa7 2(5) of the National </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 452 U. S. 628</a></p><p> Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152 (5).  I also am willing to accept, at least for purposes of this case, the Court\'s conclusion that a union constitution is a "contract."  But I do not believe it reasonably can be described as a contract between labor organizations.  To the extent a union constitution is a contract at all, it is a contract only between the union and its members or among the members themselves; it is not between the national or international union and its constituent locals.  Although the degree of autonomy given locals may vary from union to union, they nonetheless are "subordinate bodies."  Roomkin, Union Structure, Internal Control, and Strike Activity, 29 Ind. &amp; Lab.Rel.Rev.198, 199 (1976).</p>\n<p>"Local unions are <em>mere subdivsions</em> of the national organizations whose constitutions provide for their government as a state does for its counties, cities, towns, and villages."</p>\n<p>W. Leiserson, American Trade Union Democracy 87 (1959) (emphasis added).  <em>Accord, id.</em> at 280; Cook, Dual Government in Unions:  A Tool for Analysis, 15 Ind. &amp; Lab.Rel.Rev. 322, 330, 331 (1962).  Thus, locals are creatures of the national or international union and, indirectly, of the workers.  Obviously, then, union constitutions are not "contracts between . . . labor organizations"; the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7 301(a) does not confer jurisdiction over disputes arising out of violations of union constitutions. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>As we recently noted in <em>Rubin v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/case.html">449 U. S. 424</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/case.html#430">449 U. S. 430</a></span> (1981), "[w]hen we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete," unless unusual circumstances are present.  One of those circumstances may be a clear indication in the legislative history that Congress intended some other meaning.  Here, however, no such indication is present.  The Court recognizes that "there is no specific legislative history on that phrase to explain what </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 452 U. S. 629</a></p><p> Congress meant;" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#623">452 U. S. 623</a></span>; accordingly, the plain meaning, which does not confer jurisdiction over constitutional disputes, should govern.  Indeed, JUSTICE BRENNAN, in the opinion for the Court in <em>NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/175/case.html">388 U.

S. 185</a></span>-187 (1967), amply demonstrated that the only discussion in the legislative history of regulating internal union matters indicates that the principal authors of the Act expressly disclaimed any intention of intervening in such disputes.  <em>See also ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#625">452 U. S. 625</a></span>-626. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to explain these passages by saying that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa7 301(a), merely was providing for the "enforcement . . . of freely entered into agreements. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#626">452 U. S. 626</a></span>.  This is no answer when the Court also holds that the substantive law applicable "<em>is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#627">452 U.

Similarly, remarks in Committee Reports and on the floor regarding the accountability of unions for their agreements were all made in relation to collective bargaining agreements with employers; there is no reference to a local\'s invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts to enforce the provisions of union constitutions.  Thus, the legislative history is fully consistent with holding that a union constitution is not a contract between labor organizations as such.\n</em></p>\n<p>It is not irrelevant that, 12 years after the adoption of the Labor Management Relations Act in 1947, Congress expressly chose to engage in regulation of internal union matters by enacting the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 519 (codified at 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401 <em>et seq.</em>). [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The Court has recognized before that the 1959 Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 452 U.

Moreover, the careful construction and the comprehensiveness of the provisions adopted in 1959 lead to a presumption that Congress deliberately excluded from the regulatory scheme other remedies regarding internal union disputes.  <em>See Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/630/case.html">451 U.

Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I intimate no view on whether a typical contract between a union and one of its locals -- for example, for the sale of office equipment or the lease of property -- would give rise to jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 301(a).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Although these remarks were made with reference to another provision of the Act, they indicate that congressional silence, if anything, betokens <em>no</em> intent to subject internal union disputes to federal regulation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, it is seldom, if ever, proper to construe a statute on the basis of statements made in subsequent Congresses.

Lincoln Mills,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html">353 U.

The question this case presents is whether that statute conferred any such lawmaking power on the federal courts in cases arising out of contracts between two labor organizations.</p>\n<p>In <em>Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, supra,</em> the Court was presented with the question whether \xc2\xa7 301(a), which "is drafted in terms which appear to be exclusively jurisdictional," <em>Textile Workers Union v. American Thread Co.,</em> 113 F.Supp. 137, 139 (Mass.1953), was meant by Congress to be an authorization for "federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of . . . collective bargaining agreements. . . ."  353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#451">353 U. S. 451</a></span>.  After examining the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 301, the Court concluded that Congress intended to make collective bargaining agreements between unions and employers binding on both parties and, more importantly, to provide for a "procedure for making such agreements enforceable in the courts by either party."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#453">353 U.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Second, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 301 provided the basis for the Court\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 301 was not merely a grant of jurisdiction in cases involving agreements between unions and employers, but rather was a congressional authorization for the federal courts to create substantive rules to promote the important federal interests underlying the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.  Therefore, the federal interest in industrial peace and the authorization to federal courts under \xc2\xa7 301 to create rules to enforce collective bargaining agreements have, together, resulted in the creation of federal rights for both unions and employers. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Neither of the basic conclusions emerging from <em>Lincoln Mills</em> is applicable to suits on contracts between labor unions.  First, there is no indication in the statute that Congress has concluded that disputes over contracts between unions present the threat to industrial peace sufficient to justify Congress\' exercise of its power under the Commerce Clause. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 452 U. S. 635</a></p><p> More importantly, even were there such indication, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 301 provides no support for a conclusion that Congress intended the courts to create substantive law to govern contractual disputes between unions.   The legislative history of the clause relating to agreements between labor organizations does not contain even the "few shafts of light" which the Court in <em>Lincoln Mills</em> found helpful in construing the clause relating to contracts between employers and unions.  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#623">452 U. S. 623</a></span>, "there is no specific legislative history on the phrase to explain what Congress meant."  The absence of such legislative history dictates the conclusion that Congress intended the clause "or between any such labor organizations" to be a mere grant of jurisdiction over all cases arising out of contracts between unions in which a federal question otherwise exists. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  There is no justification for the conclusion that Congress perceived contracts between unions to involve any federal interest sufficient to warrant the creation of federal rights.</p>\n<p>As the Court construes the statute, however, it purports to confer authorization on federal courts to create substantive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 452 U. S. 636</a></p><p> federal common law to govern disputes between two unions over a union constitution.  The local union in this case, however, has no federal right to autonomy, and the international has no federal right to consolidate its locals.  Congress has identified no national policy favoring or disfavoring the consolidation of local unions. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Unless contracts between unions have some form of federal protection, the statute as the Court construes it is the equivalent of a statute authorizing federal urisdiction over all litigation between people named Smith, Jones, or Stevens.  Some such cases would present federal questions; some would not. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  One union may rent office space to another, lend it money, or manage its credit union.  No federal power is implicated by contracts of that kind, [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>] and no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 452 U. S. 637</a></p><p> federal rights support the conclusion that courts with the limited jurisdiction described in Art. III of the Constitution may adjudicate issues arising out of such contracts. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The conclusion that suits on contracts between labor unions are not cases "arising under" federal law is further illustrated by the choice of law that district courts would have to make in such cases.  The Court states, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/615/case.html#627">452 U. S. 627</a></span>, that courts must follow the command of <em>Lincoln Mills</em> by fashioning the federal law by looking to the "<em>policy of our national labor laws.\'"  <em>See Lincoln Mills,</em> 353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#456">353 U. S. 456</a></span>.  But in explaining the conclusion that federal interests justified the creation of a body of law to govern the enforceability of collective bargaining agreements, the <em>Lincoln Mills</em> Court indicated that the broad lawmaking powers would be limited and guided by "the penumbra of express statutory mandates" and "by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#457">353 U. S. 457</a></span>.  Five years later, in <em>Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/95/case.html">369 U. S. 95</a></span>, the Court indicated that this national policy was best served by the establishment of a uniform body of law applicable to \xc2\xa7 301 suits and held that state courts deciding \xc2\xa7 301 suits must apply the federal common law. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  In the context presented by </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 452 U.

[<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  Moreover, in the absence of some guideposts planted in federal interests, the ability to obtain -- and the need for -- uniformity will be greatly reduced.  It is difficult to conceive how the Nation\'s interest in industrial peace will be served by the creation of a body of federal law which will be based on state law and which will in large part vary from State to State.\n</em></p>\n<p>I believe that this case presents no substantive federal question.

I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court admitted that the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 301 is "somewhat cloudy and confusing," but found "a few shafts of light to illuminate our problem."  353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#452">353 U. S. 452</a></span>.  The Court noted that the Conference Committee had dropped a provision which would have made the failure to abide by an agreement to arbitrate an unfair labor practice because "the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board."  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 42 (1947); 1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, P. 546 (hereinafter Legislative History).  Both the Senate Report and the House Report indicated that collective bargaining agreements should be binding and enforceable in the courts by either party.  <em>See</em> 353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#453">353 U. S. 453</a></span>.  Moreover, Congress wanted to promote the inclusion of no-strike clauses in collective bargaining agreements:</p>\n<p>"The chief advantage which an employer can reasonably expect from a collective labor agreement is assurance of uninterrupted operation during the term of the agreement.  Without some effective method of assuring freedom from economic warfare for the term of the agreement, there is little reason why an employer would desire to sign such a contract."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 16 (1947) (hereinafter 1947 Senate Report), 1 Legislative History at 422.  Because agreements to arbitrate are the <em>quid pro quo</em> of a no-strike clause, the Court concluded that Congress intended agreements to arbitrate to be enforceable under \xc2\xa7 301.  353 U.S. at 353 U.S. 455455.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court cited <em>NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/1/case.html">301 U. S. 1</a></span>, for that proposition.  In that case, decided in 1937, the Court sustained the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act as a valid exercise of Congress\' power under the Commerce Clause.  The Court stated:</p>\n<p>"When industries organize themselves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate commerce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be maintained that their industrial labor relations constitute a forbidden field into which Congress may not enter when it is necessary to protect interstate commerce from the paralyzing consequences of industrial war?  We have often said that interstate commerce itself is a practical conception.  It is equally true that interferences with that commerce must be appraised by a judgment that does not ignore actual experlence."</p>\n<p>"Experience has abundantly demonstrated that the recognition of the right of employees to self-organization and to have representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining is often an essential condition of industrial peace.  Refusal to confer and negotiate has been one of the most prolific causes of strife."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 41-42.  Thus, 20 years later, when <em>Lincoln Mills</em> was decided, it was well settled that labor-management relations had an effect on interstate commerce.  Moreover, although the legislative history of the LMRA is "cloudy and confusing" as to the question whether \xc2\xa7 301 was substantivc or jurisdictional, the legislative history of the statute, and of \xc2\xa7 301 in particular, clearly indicates that the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements has an effect on industrial peace, and therefore on interstate commerce.  The primary purpose of the Act was "to promote the achievement of industrial peace through encouragement and refinement of the collective bargaining process."  <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html">368 U.

With respect to the subject matter of \xc2\xa7 301 the Senate Report stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]o encourage the making of agreements and to promote industrial peace through faithful performance by the parties, collective agreements affecting interstatc commerce should be enforceable in the Federal courts."</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"Statutory rccognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceablc contract is a logical and necessary step.

Although this sentence refers also to the clause relating to agreements between a labor organization and an employer -- a clause which is more than a grant of jurisdiction -- the additional legislative history with respect to such agreements provides some justification for concluding that that portion of \xc2\xa7 301 is substantive.

The Court of Appeals found no such impact.  In <em>Lincoln Mills,</em> the Court not only found a federal interest in the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, but also specifically found a federal interest in enforcing the clause requiring arbitration at issue there.  Because Congress was desirous of promoting agreements not to strike, and because agreements to arbitrate are the <em>quid pro quo</em> for agreements not to strike, the Court could infer a congressional belief that industrial peace could be fostered by the enforcement of such arbitration agreements.  <em>See</em> 353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html#455">353 U.
