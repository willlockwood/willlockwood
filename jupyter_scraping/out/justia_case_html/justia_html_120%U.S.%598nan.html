CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This motion is denied.  Although the suit was brought against Marsh, Le Fever, and Scott, Marsh and Le Fever alone answered the bill, and the decree was taken <em>pro confesso</em> against Scott.  Marsh and Le Fever alone appealed from the circuit court of the county to the supreme court of the state, and from the decree in that court they alone obtained the allowance of a writ of error to this Court.  To such a writ Scott cannot make himself a party against the objection of Marsh and Le Fever, so as to control the case in this Court.</p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
