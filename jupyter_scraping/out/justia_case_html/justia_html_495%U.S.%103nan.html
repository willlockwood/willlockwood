Ohio, 495 U.S.  103 (1990)</h3><p><b>Osborne v. Ohio</b></p><p><b>No. 88-5986</b></p><p><b>Argued Dec. 5, 1989</b></p><p><b>Decided April 18, 1990</b></p><p><b>495 U.S. 103</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>After Ohio police found photographs in petitioner Osborne\'s home, each of which depicted a nude male adolescent posed in sexually explicit position, he was convicted of violating a state statute prohibiting any person from possessing or viewing any material or performance showing a minor who is not his child or ward in a state of nudity unless (a) the material or performance is presented for a bona fide purpose by or to a person having a proper interest therein, or (b) the possessor knows that the minor\'s parents or guardian has consented in writing to such photographing or use of the minor.  An intermediate appellate court and the State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.  The latter court rejected Osborne\'s contention that the First Amendment prohibits the States from proscribing the private possession of child pornography.  The court also found that the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad, since, in light of its specific exceptions, it must be read as only applying to depictions of nudity involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the minor\'s genitals, and since scienter is an essential element of the offense.  In rejecting Osborne\'s contention that the trial court erred in not requiring the government to prove lewd exhibition and scienter as elements of his crime, the court emphasized that he had not objected to the jury instructions given at his trial, and stated that the failures of proof did not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. Ohio may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography.  Even assuming that Osborne has a valid First Amendment interest in such activities, this case is distinct from <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span>, which struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private possession of obscene material on the ground that the State\'s justifications for the law -- primarily, that obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers -- were inadequate.  In contrast, Ohio does not rely on a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne\'s mind, but has enacted its law on the basis of its compelling interests in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors and in destroying the market for the exploitative use of children by penalizing those who possess and view the offending materials.  <em>See New York v. Ferber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U.

Moreover, Ohio\'s ban encourages possessors to destroy such materials, which permanently record the victim\'s abuse and thus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 495 U.

Although, on its face, the statute purports to prohibit constitutionally protected depictions of nudity, it is doubtful that any overbreadth would be "substantial" under this Court\'s cases, in light of the statutory exemptions and "proper purposes" provisions.  In any event, the statute, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court, plainly survives overbreadth scrutiny.  By limiting the statute\'s operation to nudity that constitutes lewd exhibition or focuses on genitals, that court avoided penalizing persons for viewing or possessing innocuous photographs of naked children, and thereby rendered the "nudity" language permissible.  <em>See Ferber, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#765">458 U. S. 765</a></span>.  Moreover, the statute\'s failure, on its face, to provide a <em>mens rea</em> requirement is cured by the court\'s conclusion that the State must establish scienter under the Ohio default statute specifying that recklessness applies absent a statutory intent provision.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#111">495 U. S. 111</a></span>-115.</p>\n<p>(b) It was not impermissible for the State Supreme Court to rely on its narrowed construction of the statute when evaluating Osborne\'s overbreadth claim.  A statute as construed may be applied to conduct occurring before the construction, provided such application affords fair warning to the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#491">380 U. S. 491</a></span>, n. 7.  It is obvious from the face of the child pornography statute, and from its placement within the "Sexual Offenses" chapter of the Ohio Code, that Osborne had notice that his possession of the photographs at issue was proscribed.  <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html">378 U. S. 347</a></span>; <em>Rabe v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/313/case.html">405 U. S. 313</a></span>; and <em>Marks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html">430 U. S. 188</a></span>, distinguished.  <em>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html">382 U. S. 87</a></span> -- which stands for the proposition that, where a State Supreme Court narrows an unconstitutionally overbroad statute, the State must ensure that defendants are convicted under the statute as it is subsequently construed, and not as it was originally written -- does not conflict with the holding in this case.  Nor does <em>Massachusetts v. Oakes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html">491 U. S. 576</a></span> -- in which five Justices agreed in a separate opinion that a state legislature could not cure a potential overbreadth problem through a postconviction statutory amendment -- support Osborne\'s view that an overbroad statute is void as written, such that a court may not narrow it, affirm a conviction on the basis of the narrowing construction, and leave the statute in full force.  Since courts routinely adopt the latter course, acceptance of Osborne\'s proposition would require a radical reworking of American law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 495 U. S. 105</a></p><p>  Moreover, the <em>Oakes</em> approach is based on the fear that legislators, who know they can cure their own mistakes by amendment without significant cost, may not be careful to avoid drafting overbroad laws in the first place.  A similar effect will not be likely if a judicial construction of a statute to eliminate overbreadth is allowed to be applied in the case before the Court, since legislatures cannot be sure that the statute, when examined by a court, will be saved by a narrowing construction rather than invalidated for overbreadth, and since applying even a narrowed statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause.  Furthermore, requiring that statutes be facially invalidated whenever overbreadth is perceived would very likely invite reconsideration or redefinition of the overbreadth doctrine in a way that would not serve First Amendment interests.

Nevertheless, due process requires that Osborne\'s conviction be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, since it is unclear whether the conviction was based on a finding that the State had proved each of the elements of the offense.  It is true that this Court is precluded from reaching the due process challenge with respect to the scienter element of the crime, because counsel\'s failure to comply with the state procedural rule requiring an objection to faulty jury instructions constitutes an independent state law ground adequate to support the result below.  However, this Court is not so barred with respect to counsel\'s failure to object to the failure to instruct on lewdness, since, shortly before the brief trial, counsel moved to dismiss on the ground that the statute was overbroad in its failure to allow the viewing of innocent nude photographs.  Nothing would be gained by requiring counsel to object a second time, specifically to the jury instructions.  The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, may not be defeated under the name of local practice.  <em>Cf. Douglas v.

S. 107</a></p><p> or use of the minor in a state of nudity and to the manner in which the material or performance is used or transferred."</p>\n<p>Petitioner, Clyde Osborne, was convicted of violating this statute and sentenced to six months in prison after the Columbus, Ohio, police, pursuant to a valid search, found four photographs in Osborne\'s home.  Each photograph depicts a nude male adolescent posed in a sexually explicit position. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Osborne\'s conviction after an intermediate appellate court did the same.  <em>State v. Young,</em> 37 Ohio St.3d 249, 525 N.E.2d 1363 (1988).  Relying on one of its earlier decisions, the Court first rejected Osborne\'s contention that the First Amendment prohibits the States from proscribing the private possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p>Next, the Court found that \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  In so doing, the Court, relying on the statutory exceptions, read \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) as only applying to depictions of nudity involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on a minor\'s genitals.  The Court also found that scienter is an essential element of a \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) offense.  Osborne objected that the trial judge had not insisted that the government prove lewd exhibition and scienter as elements of his crime.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected these contentions because Osborne had failed to object to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 495 U. S. 108</a></p><p> jury instructions given at his trial and the Court did not believe that the failures of proof amounted to plain error.

We noted probable jurisdiction last June.  492 U.S. 904.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The threshold question in this case is whether Ohio may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography or whether, as Osborne argues, our decision in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969), compels the contrary result.  In <em>Stanley,</em> we struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private possession of obscene material.  We recognized that the statute impinged upon Stanley\'s right to receive information in the privacy of his home, and we found Georgia\'s justifications for its law inadequate.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#564">394 U. S. 564</a></span>-568. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Stanley</em> should not be read too broadly.  We have previously noted that <em>Stanley</em> was a narrow holding, <em>see United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/123/case.html">413 U. S. 123</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/123/case.html#127">413 U. S. 127</a></span> (1973), and, since the decision in that case, the value of permitting child pornography has been characterized as "exceedingly modest, if not <em>de minimis.</em>"  <em>New York v.

But assuming, for the sake of argument, that Osborne has a First Amendment interest in viewing and possessing child pornography, we nonetheless find this case distinct from <em>Stanley</em> because the interests underlying child pornography prohibitions far exceed the interests justifying the Georgia law at issue in <em>Stanley.</em>  Every court to address the issue has so concluded.  <em>See e.g., People v. Geever,</em> 122 Ill.2d 313, 327-328, 119 Ill.Dec. 341, 347-348, 522 N.E.2d 1200, 1206-1207 (1988); </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 495 U. S. 109</a></p><p> <em>Felton v.

Rather, Ohio has enacted \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) in order to protect the victims of child pornography; it hopes to destroy a market for the exploitative use of children.</p>\n<p>"It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State\'s interest in \'safeguarding the physical and psychological wellbeing of a minor\' is \'compelling.\' . . .  The legislative judgment, as well as the judgment found in relevant literature, is that the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.

In <em>Ferber,</em> where we upheld a New York statute outlawing the distribution of child pornography, we found a similar argument persuasive:</p>\n<p>"[t]he advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for, and are thus an integral part of, the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation."</p>\n<p>"It rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#761">458 U.

Osborne points out that, in <em>Stanley,</em> we rejected Georgia\'s argument that its prohibition on obscenity possession was a necessary incident to its proscription on obscenity distribution.  394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#567">394 U.

This holding, however, must be viewed in light of the weak interests asserted by the State in that case.  <em>Stanley</em> itself emphasized that we did not</p>\n<p>"mean to express any opinion on statutes making criminal possession of other types of printed, filmed, or recorded materials. . . .  In such cases, compelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those materials."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#568">394 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Given the importance of the State\'s interest in protecting the victims of child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain.  According to the State, since the time of our decision in <em>Ferber,</em> much of the child pornography market has been driven underground; as a result, it is now difficult, if not impossible, to solve the child pornography problem by only attacking production and distribution.  Indeed, 19 States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 495 U. S. 111</a></p><p> have found it necessary to proscribe the possession of this material. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Other interests also support the Ohio law.  First, as <em>Ferber</em> recognized, the materials produced by child pornographers permanently record the victim\'s abuse.  The pornography\'s continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come.  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#759">458 U. S. 759</a></span>.  The State\'s ban on possession and viewing encourages the possessors of these materials to destroy them.  Second, encouraging the destruction of these materials is also desirable because evidence suggests that pedophiles use child pornography to seduce other children into sexual activity. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Given the gravity of the State\'s interests in this context, we find that Ohio may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Osborne next argues that, even if the State may constitutionally ban the possession of child pornography, his conviction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 495 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In our previous decisions discussing the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, we have repeatedly emphasized that, where a statute regulates expressive conduct, the scope of the statute does not render it unconstitutional unless its overbreadth is not only "real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\'s plainly legitimate sweep."  <em>Broadrick v.

We have stated that depictions of nudity, without more, constitute protected expression.  <em>See Ferber, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#765">458 U. S. 765</a></span>, n. 18.  Relying on this observation, Osborne argues that the statute, as written, is substantially overbroad.  We are sceptical of this claim because, in light of the statute\'s exemptions and "proper purposes" provisions, the statute may not be substantially overbroad under our cases. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  However that may be, Osborne\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 495 U. S. 113</a></p><p> overbreadth challenge, in any event, fails because the statute, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court on Osborne\'s direct appeal, plainly survives overbreadth scrutiny.  Under the Ohio Supreme Court reading, the statute prohibits</p>\n<p>"the possession or viewing of material or performance of a minor who is in a state of nudity, where such nudity constitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals, and where the person depicted is neither the child nor the ward of the person charged."</p>\n<p>37 Ohio St.3d at 252, 525 N.E.2d at 1368.

We have upheld similar language against overbreadth challenges in the past.

That statute makes it a crime to mail an "obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance."  In <em>Hamling,</em> for the first time, we construed the term "obscenity" as used in \xc2\xa7 1461</p>\n<p>"to be limited to the sort of "patently offensive representations or depictions of that specific <em>hard core\' sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller v. California.</em>"" </em></p>\n<p>In light of this construction, we rejected the petitioners\' facial challenge to the statute as written, and we affirmed the petitioners\' convictions under the section after finding that the petitioners had fair notice that their conduct was criminal.  418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#114">418 U. S. 114</a></span>-116.</p>\n<p>Like the <em>Hamling</em> petitioners, Osborne had notice that his conduct was proscribed.  It is obvious from the face of \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) that the goal of the statute is to eradicate child pornography.  The provision criminalizes the viewing and possessing of material depicting children in a state of nudity for other than "proper purposes."  The provision appears in the "Sex Offenses" chapter of the Ohio Code.  Section 2907.323 is preceded by \xc2\xa7 2907.322, which proscribes "[p]andering sexually oriented matter involving a minor," and followed by \xc2\xa7 2907.33, which proscribes "[d]eception to obtain matter harmful to juveniles."  That Osborne\'s photographs of adolescent boys in sexually explicit situations constitute child pornography hardly needs elaboration.  Therefore, although \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3), as written, may have been imprecise at its fringes, someone in Osborne\'s position would not be surprised to learn that his possession of the four photographs at issue in this case constituted a crime.</p>\n<p>Because Osborne had notice that his conduct was criminal, his case differs from three cases upon which he relies:  <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html">378 U. S. 347</a></span> (1964), <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/313/case.html">Rabe v. Washington,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 495 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html">430 U. S. 188</a></span> (1977).  In <em>Bouie,</em> the petitioners had refused to leave a restaurant after being asked to do so by the restaurant\'s manager.  Although the manager had not objected when the petitioners entered the restaurant, the petitioners were convicted of violating a South Carolina trespass statute proscribing "<em>entry upon the lands, of another . . . after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\'"  378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html#349">378 U. S. 349</a></span>.  Affirming the convictions, the South Carolina Supreme Court construed the trespass law as also making it a crime for an individual to remain on another\'s land after being asked to leave.  We reversed the convictions on due process grounds, because the South Carolina Supreme Court\'s expansion of the statute was unforeseeable and therefore the petitioners had no reason to suspect that their conduct was criminal.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/347/case.html#350">378 U. S. 350</a></span>-352.\n</em></p>\n<p>Likewise, in <em>Rabe v. Washington, supra,</em> the petitioner had been convicted of violating a Washington obscenity statute that, by its terms, did not proscribe the defendant\'s conduct.  On petitioner\'s appeal, the Washington Supreme Court nevertheless affirmed the petitioner\'s conviction after construing the Washington obscenity statute to reach the petitioner.  We overturned the conviction because the Washington Supreme Court\'s broadening of the statute was unexpected; therefore the petitioner had no warning that his actions were proscribed.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/226/case.html#315">378 U.

Birmingham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html">382 U. S. 87</a></span> (1965); we disagree.  In <em>Shuttlesworth,</em> the defendant had been convicted of violating an Alabama statute that, when read literally, provided that "a person may stand on a public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html#90">382 U. S. 90</a></span>.  We stated that "[t]he constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration."  <em>Ibid.</em>  As subsequently construed by the Alabama Supreme Court, however, the statute merely made it criminal for an individual that was blocking free passage along a public street to disobey a police officer\'s order to move.  We noted that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is our duty, of course, to accept this state judicial construction of the ordinance. . . .  As so construed, we cannot say that the ordinance is unconstitutional, though it requires no great feat of imagination to envisage situations in which such an ordinance might be unconstitutionally applied."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html#91">382 U.

We nevertheless reversed the defendant\'s conviction because it was not clear that the state had convicted the defendant under the statute as construed, rather than as written.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html#91">382 U. S. 91</a></span>-92. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  <em>Shuttlesworth,</em> then stands for the proposition that, where a State Supreme Court narrows an unconstitutionally overbroad statute, the State must ensure that defendants are convicted under the statute as it is subsequently construed, and not as it was originally written; this proposition in no way conflicts with our holding in this case.</p>\n<p>Finally, despite Osborne\'s contention to the contrary, we do not believe that <em>Massachusetts v. Oakes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html">491 U. S. 576</a></span> (1989), supports his theory of this case.  In <em>Oakes,</em> the petitioner challenged a Massachusetts pornography statute as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 495 U. S. 119</a></p><p> overbroad; since the time of the defendant\'s alleged crime, however, the state had substantially narrowed the statute through a subsequent legislative enactment -- an amendment to the statute.  In a separate opinion, five Justices agreed that the state legislature could not cure the potential overbreadth problem through the subsequent legislative action; the statute was void as written.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html#585">491 U. S. 585</a></span>-586.</p>\n<p>Osborne contends that <em>Oakes</em> stands for a similar but distinct proposition that, when faced with a potentially overinclusive statute, a court may not construe the statute to avoid overbreadth problems and then apply the statute, as construed, to past conduct.  The implication of this argument is that, if a statute is overbroad as written, then the statute is void and incurable.  As a result, when reviewing a conviction under a potentially overbroad statute, a court must either affirm or strike down the statute on its face, but the court may not, as the Ohio Supreme Court did in this case, narrow the statute, affirm on the basis of the narrowing construction, and leave the statute in full force.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>First, as indicated by our earlier discussion, if we accepted this proposition, it would require a radical reworking of our law.  Courts routinely construe statutes so as to avoid the statutes\' potentially overbroad reach, apply the statute in that case, and leave the statute in place.  In <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span> (1957), for example, the court construed the open-ended terms used in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1461, which prohibits the mailing of material that is "obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile."  Justice Harlan characterized <em>Roth</em> in this way:</p>\n<p>"The words of \xc2\xa7 1461, \'obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\' connote something that is portrayed in manner so offensive as to make is unacceptable under current community <em>mores.</em>  While in common usage the words have different shades of meaning, the statute since its inception has always been taken as aimed at obnoxiously debasing portrayals of sex.  Although the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 495 U. S. 120</a></p><p> statute condemns such material irrespective of the <em>effect</em> it may have upon those into whose hands it falls, the early case of <em>United States v. Bennet,</em> 24 Fed.Cas. 1093 (No. 14571), put a limiting gloss upon the statutory language:  the statute reaches only indecent material which, as now expressed in <em>Roth v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/354/476/case.html#489">354 U. S. 489</a></span> \'taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\'  <em>Manuel Enterprises v. Day,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/370/478/case.html">370 U.

S. 112</a></span> (quoting the above).  The petitioner\'s conviction was affirmed in <em>Roth,</em> and federal obscenity law was left in force.  354 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#494">354 U. S. 494</a></span>. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We, moreover, have long respected the state Supreme Courts\' ability to narrow state statutes so as to limit the statute\'s scope to unprotected conduct.  <em>See, e.g., Ginsberg v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/case.html">390 U. S. 629</a></span> (1968).</p>\n<p>Second, we do not believe that <em>Oakes</em> compels the proposition that Osborne urges us to accept.  In <em>Oakes,</em> Justice SCALIA, writing for himself and four others, reasoned that</p>\n<p>"The overbreadth doctrine serves to protect constitutionally legitimate speech not merely <em>ex post</em> that is, after the offending statute is enacted, but also <em>ex ante</em> that is, when the legislature is contemplating what sort of statute to enact.  If the promulgation of overbroad laws affecting speech was cost free . . . that is, if <em>no</em> conviction of constitutionally proscribable conduct would be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 495 U. S. 121</a></p><p> lost so long as the offending statute was narrowed before the final appeal, . . . then legislatures would have significantly reduced incentive to stay within constitutional bounds in the first place.  When one takes account of those overbroad statutes that are never challenged, and of the time that elapses before the ones that are challenged are amended to come within constitutional bounds, a substantial amount of legitimate speech would be \'chilled.\' . . . "</p>\n<p>491 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html#586">491 U. S. 586</a></span> (emphasis in original).  In other words, five of the <em>Oakes</em> Justices feared that, if we allowed a legislature to correct its mistakes without paying for them (beyond the inconvenience of passing a new law), we would decrease the legislature\'s incentive to draft a narrowly tailored law in the first place.</p>\n<p>Legislators who know they can cure their own mistakes by amendment without significant cost may not be as careful to avoid drafting overbroad statutes as they might otherwise be.  But a similar effect will not be likely if a judicial construction of a statute to eliminate overbreadth is allowed to be applied in the case before the Court.  This is so primarily because the legislatures cannot be sure that the statute, when examined by a court, will be saved by a narrowing construction rather than invalidated for overbreadth.  In the latter event, there could be no convictions under that law even of those whose own conduct is unprotected by the First Amendment.  Even if construed to obviate overbreadth, applying the statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause.  Thus, careless drafting cannot be considered to be cost-free based on the power of the courts to eliminate overbreadth by statutory construction.</p>\n<p>There are also other considerations.  Osborne contends that, when courts construe statutes so as to eliminate overbreadth, convictions of those found guilty of unprotected conduct covered by the statute must be reversed, and any further </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 495 U. S. 122</a></p><p> convictions for prior reprehensible conduct are barred. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Furthermore, because he contends that overbroad laws implicating First Amendment interests are nullities, and incapable of valid application from the outset, this would mean that judicial construction could not save the statute, even as applied to subsequent conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.  The overbreadth doctrine, as we have recognized, is indeed "strong medicine," <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html#613">413 U. S. 613</a></span>, and requiring that statutes be facially invalidated whenever overbreadth is perceived would very likely invite reconsideration or redefinition of the doctrine in a way that would not serve First Amendment interests. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Having rejected Osborne\'s <em>Stanley</em> and overbreadth arguments, we now reach Osborne\'s final objection to his conviction:  his contention that he was denied due process because it is unclear that his conviction was based on a finding that each of the elements of \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) was present. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  According </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 495 U. S. 123</a></p><p> to the Ohio Supreme Court, in order to secure a conviction under \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3), the State must prove both scienter and that the defendant possessed material depicting a lewd exhibition or a graphic focus on genitals.  The jury in this case was not instructed that it could convict Osborne only for conduct that satisfied these requirements.</p>\n<p>The State concedes the omissions in the jury instructions, but argues that Osborne waived his right to assert this due process challenge because he failed to object when the instructions were given at his trial.  The Ohio Supreme Court so held, citing Ohio law.  The question before us now, therefore, is whether we are precluded from reaching Osborne\'s due process challenge because counsel\'s failure to comply with the procedural rule constitutes an independent state law ground adequate to support the result below.  We have no difficulty agreeing with the State that Osborne\'s counsel\'s failure to urge that the court instruct the jury on scienter constitutes an independent and adequate state law ground preventing us from reaching Osborne\'s due process contention on that point.  Ohio law states that proof of scienter is required in instances, like the present one, where a criminal statute does not specify the applicable mental state.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra.</em>  The state procedural rule, moreover, serves the State\'s important interest in ensuring that counsel do their part in preventing trial courts from providing juries with erroneous instructions.</p>\n<p>With respect to the trial court\'s failure to instruct on lewdness, however, we reach a different conclusion:  based upon our review of the record, we believe that counsel\'s failure to object on this point does not prevent us from considering Osborne\'s constitutional claim.  Osborne\'s trial was brief:  the State called only the two arresting officers to the stand; the defense summoned only Osborne himself.  Right before trial, Osborne\'s counsel moved to dismiss the case, contending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 495 U. S. 124</a></p><p> that \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) is unconstitutionally overbroad.  Counsel stated:</p>\n<p>"I\'m filing a motion to dismiss based on the fact that [the] statute is void for vagueness, overbroad . . .  The statute\'s overbroad because . . . a person couldn\'t have pictures of his own grandchildren; probably couldn\'t even have nude photographs of himself."</p>\n<p>"Judge, if you had some nude photos of yourself when you were a child, you would probably be violating the law. . . . "</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"So grandparents, neighbors, or other people who happen to view the photograph are criminally liable under the statute.  And on that basis, I\'m going to ask the Court to dismiss the case."</p>\n<p>Tr. 3-4.  The prosecutor informed the trial judge that a number of Ohio state courts had recently rejected identical motions challenging \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3).  Tr. 5-6.  The court then overruled the motion. <em>Id.</em> at 7.  Immediately thereafter, Osborne\'s counsel proposed various jury instructions.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Given this sequence of events, we believe that we may reach Osborne\'s due process claim, because we are convinced that Osborne\'s attorney pressed the issue of the State\'s failure of proof on lewdness before the trial court and, under the circumstances, nothing would be gained by requiring Osborne\'s lawyer to object a second time, specifically to the jury instructions.  The trial judge, in no uncertain terms, rejected counsel\'s argument that the statute, as written, was overbroad.  The State contends that counsel should then have insisted that the court instruct the jury on lewdness because, absent a finding that this element existed, a conviction would be unconstitutional.  Were we to accept this position, we would "<em>force resort to an arid ritual of meaningless form,\' . . . and would further no perceivable state interest."\n</em></p>\n<p><em>James v.

The State, moreover, does not impose criminal liability if either</p>\n<p>"[t]he material or performance is sold, disseminated, displayed, possessed, controlled, brought or caused to be brought into this state, or presented for a bona fide artistic, medical, scientific, educational, religious, governmental, judicial, or other proper purpose, by or to a physician, psychologist, sociologist, scientist, teacher, person pursuing bona fide studies or research, librarian, clergyman, prosecutor, judge, or other person having a proper interest in the material or performance,"</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>"[t]he person knows that the parents, guardian, or custodian has consented in writing to the photographing or use of the minor in a state of nudity and to the manner in which the material or performance is used or transferred."</p>\n<p>It is true that, despite the statutory exceptions, one might imagine circumstances in which the statute, by its terms, criminalizes constitutionally protected conduct.  If, for example, a parent gave a family friend a picture of the parent\'s infant taken while the infant was unclothed, the statute would apply.  But, given the broad statutory exceptions and the prevalence of child pornography, it is far from clear that the instances where the statute applies to constitutionally protected conduct are significant enough to warrant a finding that the statute is overbroad.  <em>Cf. Oakes, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html#589">491 U.

Although \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) does not specify a mental state, Ohio law provides that recklessness is the appropriate <em>mens rea</em> where a statute "neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability."  Ohio Rev.Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 2901.21(B) (1987).</p>\n<p>We also do not find any merit to Osborne\'s claim that \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the term "minor."  Under Ohio law, a minor is anyone under eighteen years of age.

The clear purpose of these exceptions . . . is to sanction the possession or viewing of material depicting nude minors where that conduct is morally innocent.  Thus, the only conduct prohibited by the statute is conduct which is <em>not</em> morally innocent, <em>i.e.,</em> the possession or viewing of the described material for prurient purposes.  So construed, the statute\'s proscription is not so broad as to outlaw all depictions of minors in a state of nudity, but rather only those depictions which constitute child pornography."</p>\n<p>37 Ohio St.3d at 251-252, 525 N.E.2d at 1367-1368 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The statute upheld against an overbreadth challenge in <em>Ferber</em> was, moreover, arguably less narrowly tailored than the statute challenged in this case, because, unlike \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3), the New York law did not provide a broad range of exceptions to the general prohibition on lewd exhibition of the genitals.  Despite this lack of exceptions, we upheld the New York law, reasoning that</p>\n<p>"[h]ow often, if ever, it may be necessary to employ children to engage in conduct clearly within the reach of [the statute] in order to produce educational, medical, or artistic works cannot be known with certainty.

We do not agree that this distinction between body areas and specific body parts is constitutionally significant:  the crucial question is whether the depiction is lewd, not whether the depiction happens to focus on the genitals or the buttocks.  In any event, however, Osborne would not be entitled to relief.  The context of the opinion indicates that the Ohio Supreme Court believed that "the term `nudity,\' as used in R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), refers to a lewd exhibition of the genitals."  <em>State v.

We acknowledge (<em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra,</em> ) that the statute, as written, might reach such conduct, but, as construed, the statute would surely not apply, because the photograph would not involve a "lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the genitals" of the child.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>This principle, of course, accords with the rationale underlying overbreadth challenges.

S. 146</a></span>, n. 20, that this Court\'s ability to entertain Osborne\'s due process claim premised on the failure of the trial court to charge the "lewd exhibition" and "graphic focus" elements does not depend upon his objection to this failure at trial.</p>\n<p>Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that appellant\'s conviction must be reversed.  I do not agree, however, that Ohio is free on remand to retry him under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) (Supp.1989) as it currently exists.  In my view, the state law, even as construed authoritatively by the Ohio Supreme Court, is still fatally overbroad, and our decision in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U.

I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>As written, the Ohio statute is plainly overbroad.  Section 2907.323(A)(3) makes it a crime to "[p]ossess or view any material or performance that shows a minor who is not the person\'s child or ward in a state of nudity."  Another section defines "nudity" as</p>\n<p>"the showing, representation, or depiction of human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a full, opaque covering, or of a female breast with less than a full opaque covering of any portion thereof </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 495 U.

In short, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2907.323 and 2907.01(H) use simple nudity, without more, as a way of defining child pornography.

Young,</em> 37 Ohio St.3d 249, 252, 525 N.E.2d 1363, 1368 (1988).

Relying exclusively on our previous decision in <em>New York v. Ferber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U. S. 747</a></span> (1982), [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 495 U.

S. 114</a></span>.  The Court\'s terse explanation is unsatisfactory, since <em>Ferber</em> involved a law that differs in crucial respects from the one here.</p>\n<p>The New York law at issue in <em>Ferber</em> criminalized the use of a child in a "<em><em>[s]exual performance,</em>\'" defined as "`any performance or part thereof which includes sexual conduct by a child less than sixteen years of age.\'"  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#751">458 U. S. 751</a></span> (quoting N.Y.Penal Law \xc2\xa7 263.00(1) (McKinney 1980)).  "`"<em>Sexual conduct</em>"\'" was in turn defined as "`actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.\'"  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#751">458 U. S. 751</a></span> (quoting \xc2\xa7 263.00(3)).  Although we acknowledged that "nudity, without more[,] is protected expression," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#765">458 U. S. 765</a></span>, n. 18, we found that the statute was not overbroad because only "a tiny fraction of materials within the statute\'s reach" was constitutionally protected.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#773">458 U. S. 773</a></span>; <em>see also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#776">458 U. S. 776</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  We therefore upheld the conviction of a bookstore proprietor who sold films depicting young boys masturbating.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Ohio law is distinguishable for several reasons.  First, the New York statute did not criminalize materials with a "<em>graphic focus</em>" on the genitals, and, as discussed further below, Ohio\'s "graphic focus" test is impermissibly capacious.  Even setting aside the "graphic focus" element, the Ohio Supreme Court\'s narrowing construction is still overbroad, because it focuses on "lewd exhibitions of <em>nudity,</em>" rather than "lewd exhibitions of <em>the genitals</em>" in the context of <em>sexual conduct,</em> as in the New York statute at issue in <em>Ferber.</em> [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 495 U. S. 130</a></p><p>  Ohio law defines "nudity" to include depictions of pubic areas, buttocks, the female breast, and covered male genitals "in a discernibly turgid state," as well as depictions of the genitals.  On its face, then, the Ohio law is much broader than New York\'s.</p>\n<p>In addition, whereas the Ohio Supreme Court\'s interpretation uses the "lewd exhibition of nudity" test standing alone, the New York law employed the phrase "<em>lewd exhibition of </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 495 U. S. 131</a></em></p><p><em> the genitals\'" in the context of a longer list of examples of sexual conduct:  "`actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, [and] sado-masochistic abuse.\'"  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#751">458 U. S. 751</a></span>.  This syntax was important to our decision in <em>Ferber.</em>  We recognized the potential for impermissible applications of the New York statute, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#773">458 U. S. 773</a></span>, but in view of the examples of "sexual conduct" provided by the statute, we were willing to assume that the New York courts would not\n</em></p>\n<p>"widen the <em>possibly invalid</em> reach of the statute by giving an expansive construction to the proscription on \'lewd exhibition[s] of the genitals.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  In the Ohio statute, of course, there is no analog to the elaborate definition of "sexual conduct" to serve as a similar limit.  Hence, while the New York law could be saved at least in part by the notion of <em>ejusdem generis, see</em> 2A C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 47.17, p. 166 (4th ed. 1984), the Ohio Supreme Court\'s construction of its law cannot.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the broad definition of nudity in the Ohio statutory scheme means that "child pornography" could include any photograph depicting a "lewd exhibition" of even a small portion of a minor\'s buttocks or any part of the female breast below the nipple.  Pictures of topless bathers at a Mediterranean beach, of teenagers in revealing dresses, and even of toddlers romping unclothed, all might be prohibited. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Furthermore, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 495 U. S. 132</a></p><p> the Ohio law forbids not only depictions of nudity<em>per se,</em> but also depictions of the buttocks, breast, or pubic area with less than a "full, opaque covering."  Thus, pictures of fashion models wearing semitransparent clothing might be illegal, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] as might a photograph depicting a fully clad male that nevertheless captured his genitals "in a discernibly turgid state."  The Ohio statute thus sweeps in many types of materials that are not "child pornography" as we used that term in <em>Ferber,</em> but rather that enjoy full First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p>It might be objected that many of these depictions of nudity do not amount to "lewd exhibitions."  But in the absence of <em>any</em> authoritative definition of that phrase by the Ohio Supreme Court, we cannot predict which ones.  Many would characterize a photograph of a seductive fashion model or alluringly posed adolescent on a topless European beach as "lewd," although such pictures indisputably enjoy constitutional protection.  Indeed, some might think that <em>any</em> nudity, especially that involving a minor, is by definition "lewd," yet this Court has clearly established that nudity is not excluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 495 U. S. 133</a></p><p> automatically from the scope of the First Amendment.  The Court today is unable even to hazard a guess as to what a "lewd exhibition" might mean; it is forced to rely entirely on an inapposite case -- <em>Ferber</em> -- that simply did not discuss, let alone decide, the central issue here.</p>\n<p>The Ohio Supreme Court provided few clues as to the meaning of the phrase "lewd exhibition of nudity."  The court distinguished "child pornography" from "obscenity," <em>see</em> 37 Ohio St.3d at 257, 525 N.E.2d at 1372, thereby implying that it did not believe that an exhibition was required to be "obscene" in order to qualify as "lewd." [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  But it supplied no authoritative definition -- a disturbing omission in light of the absence of the phrase "lewd exhibition" from the statutory definition section of the Sex Offenses chapter of the Ohio Revised Code.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 2907.01. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  In fact, the word </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 495 U. S. 134</a></p><p> "lewd" does not appear in the statutory definition of any crime involving obscenity or other sexually oriented materials in the Ohio Revised Code.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2907.31-2907.35. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 495 U. S. 135</a></p><p>  Thus, when the Ohio Supreme Court grafted the "lewd exhibition" test onto the definition of nudity, it was venturing into uncharted territory. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is no longstanding, commonly understood definition of "lewd" upon which the Ohio Supreme Court\'s construction might be said to draw that can save the "lewd exhibition" standard from impermissible vagueness. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  At </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 495 U. S. 136</a></p><p> common law, the term "lewd" included "any gross indecency so notorious as to tend to corrupt community morals," <em>Collins v. State,</em> 160 Ga.App. 680, 682, 288 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1981), an approach that was "subjective" and dependent entirely on a speaker\'s "social, moral, and cultural bias."  <em>Moryan v. Detroit,</em> 389 F.Supp. 922, 930 (ED Mich. 1975). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Not surprisingly, States with long experience in applying indecency laws have learned that the word "lewd" is "too indefinite and uncertain to be enforceable."  <em>Courtemanche v. State,</em> 507 S.W.2d 545, 546 (Tex.Cr.App.1974).  <em>See also Attwood v. Purcell,</em> 402 F.Supp. 231, 235 (Ariz.1975); <em>District of Columbia v. Walters,</em> 319 A.2d 332, 335-336 (D.C.1974).  The term is often defined by reference to such pejorative synonyms as "<em>lustful, lascivious, unchaste, wanton, or loose in morals and conduct.\'" <em>People v. Williams,</em> 59 Cal.App.3d 225, 229, 130 Cal.Rptr. 460, 462 (1976).  But "the very phrases and synonyms through which meaning is purportedly ascribed serve to obscure rather than clarify."  <em>State v. Kueny,</em> 215 N.W.2d 215, 217 (Iowa 1974).\n</em></p>\n<p>"To instruct the jury that a \'lewd or dissolute\' act is one which is morally \'loose,\' or \'lawless,\' or \'foul\' piles additional uncertainty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 495 U.

In sum, the addition of a "lewd exhibition" standard does not narrow adequately the statute\'s reach.

This phrase, a stranger to obscenity regulation, suffers from the same vagueness difficulty as "lewd exhibition."  Although the Ohio Supreme Court failed to elaborate what a "graphic focus" might be, the test appears to involve nothing more than a subjective estimation of the centrality or prominence of the genitals in a picture or other representation.  Not only is this factor dependent on the perspective and idiosyncrasies of the observer, it also is unconnected to whether the material at issue merits constitutional protection.  Simple nudity, no matter how prominent or "graphic," is within the bounds of the First Amendment.  Michelangelo\'s "David" might be said to have a "graphic focus" on the genitals, for it plainly portrays them in a manner unavoidable to even a casual observer.  Similarly, a painting of a partially clad girl could be said to involve a "graphic focus," depending on the picture\'s lighting and emphasis, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] as could the depictions of nude children on the friezes that adorn our Courtroom.  Even a photograph of a child running naked on the beach or playing in the bathtub might run afoul of the law, depending on the focus and camera angle.</p>\n<p>In sum, the "lewd exhibition" and "graphic focus" tests are too vague to serve as any workable limit.  Because the statute, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 495 U. S. 139</a></p><p> even as construed authoritatively by the Ohio Supreme Court, is impermissibly overbroad, I would hold that appellant cannot be retried under it. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if the statute was not overbroad, our decision in <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969), forbids the criminalization of appellant\'s private possession in his home of the materials at issue.</p>\n<p>"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that the State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#565">394 U. S. 565</a></span>.  Appellant was convicted for possessing four photographs of nude minors, seized from a desk drawer in the bedroom of his house during a search executed pursuant to a warrant.  Appellant testified that he had been given the pictures in his home by a friend.  There was no evidence that the photographs had been produced commercially or distributed.  All were kept in an album that appellant had assembled for his personal use, and had possessed privately for several years.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, the Court\'s focus on <em>Ferber</em> rather than <em>Stanley</em> is misplaced.  <em>Ferber</em> held only that child pornography is "a category of material the <em>production</em> and <em>distribution</em> of which is not entitled to First Amendment protection," 458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#765">458 U. S. 765</a></span> (emphasis added); our decision did not extend to private <em>possession.</em>  The authority of a State to regulate the production and distribution of such materials is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 495 U. S. 140</a></p><p> not dispositive of its power to penalize possession. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Indeed, in <em>Stanley,</em> we assumed that the films at issue were obscene, and that their production, sale, and distribution thus could have been prohibited under our decisions.  <em>See</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#559">394 U. S. 559</a></span>, n. 2.  Nevertheless, we reasoned that, although the States "retain broad power to regulate obscenity" -- and child pornography as well -- "that power simply does not extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#568">394 U.

The majority determines that appellant\'s due process rights were violated because the jury was not instructed according to the interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court on appeal.  That is to say, the jury was not told that</p>\n<p>"the State must prove both scienter and that the defendant possessed material depicting a lewd exhibition or a graphic focus on genitals."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#123">495 U.

The Court finds that appellant\'s challenge to the trial court\'s failure to charge the "lewd exhibition" and "graphic focus" elements is properly before us, because appellant objected at trial to the overbreadth of \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3).  <em>See </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 495 U.

I agree with the Court\'s conclusion that we may reach the merits of appellant\'s claim on this point. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>But the Court does not rest there.  Instead, in what is apparently dictum, given its decision to reverse appellant\'s conviction on the basis of the first due process claim, the Court maintains that a separate due process challenge by appellant arising from the Ohio Supreme Court\'s addition of a scienter element is procedurally barred, because appellant failed to object at trial to the absence of a scienter instruction.  The Court maintains that \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) must be interpreted in light of \xc2\xa7 2901.21(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, which provides that recklessness is the appropriate <em>mens rea</em> where a statute "<em>neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#113">495 U.

I cannot agree with this gratuitous aspect of the Court\'s reasoning.\n</em></p>\n<p>First, the overbreadth contention voiced by appellant must be read as fairly encompassing an objection both to the lack of an intent requirement and to the definition of "nudity."  Appellant objected to, <em>inter alia,</em> the criminalization of the "mere possession or viewing of a photograph," without the need for the State to show additional elements.  Tr. 4.  A natural inference from this language is that intent is one of the additional elements that the State should have been required to prove.  There is no need to demand any greater precision from a criminal defendant, and, in my judgment, the overbreadth challenge was sufficient, as a matter of federal law, to preserve the due process claim arising from the addition of a scienter element.  As the majority acknowledges, our decision in <em>Ferber</em> mandated that "prohibitions on child pornography include some element of scienter."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#115">495 U. S. 115</a></span> (citing <em>Ferber,</em> 458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#765">458 U. S. 765</a></span>).  In <em>Ferber,</em> we recognize that adding an intent requirement was part of the process of narrowing an otherwise overbroad statute, and appellant\'s contention that the statute was overbroad should be interpreted in that light.  I find the Ohio Supreme Court\'s logic internally contradictory:  in one breath, it adopted a scienter requirement of recklessness to narrow the statute in response to appellant\'s overbreadth challenge, and then, in the next breath, it insisted that appellant had failed to object to the lack of a scienter element.</p>\n<p>Second, even if appellant had failed to object at trial to the failure of the jury instructions to include a scienter element, I cannot agree with the reasoning of the Ohio Supreme Court, unquestioned by the majority today, that "the omission of the element of recklessness [did] not constitute plain error."  37 Ohio St.3d at 254, 525 N.E.2d at 1370.  To the contrary, a judge\'s failure to instruct the jury on every element of an offense violates a "<em>bedrock, "axiomatic and elementary" [constitutional] principle,\'" <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/case.html">Francis v.

I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Other provisions of Ohio law relating to child pornography are not phrased in terms of "nudity."  For example, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2907.321 (Supp.1989) prohibits the knowing creation, sale, distribution, or possession of "obscenity involving a minor."  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2907.322 (Supp.1989) prohibits the knowing creation, sale, distribution, or possession of materials depicting a minor engaging in "sexual activity" (defined as "sexual conduct or sexual contact," <em>se</em>e \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2907.01(A), (B), (C)), masturbation, or bestiality.  The documented harm from child pornography arises chiefly from the type of <em>obscene</em> materials that would be punished under these provisions, rather than from the depictions of mere "nudity" that are criminalized in \xc2\xa7 2907.323.  <em>See New York v.

The enumerated "proper purposes" (<em>e.g.,</em> a "bona fide artistic, medical, scientific, educational . . . or other proper purpose") are simultaneously too vague and too narrow.  What is an acceptable "artistic" purpose?  Would erotic art along the lines of Robert Mapplethorpe\'s qualify?  What is a valid "scientific" or "educational" purpose?  What about sex manuals?  <em>See, e.g., Faloona v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,</em> 607 F.Supp. 1341 (ND Tex.1985), <em>aff\'d,</em> 799 F.2d 1000 (CA5 1986).  What is a permissible "other proper purpose"?  What about photos taken for one purpose and recirculated for other, more prurient purposes?

The passage cited (and quoted in part) by the Court, however, is a description of appellant\'s objections at trial and his argument on appeal, not a precise formulation by the Ohio Supreme Court of the "lewd exhibition" test.  Indeed, only two sentences after the quotation cited by the majority, the Ohio court referred to "lewdness [a]s an element of <em>nudity</em> under R.C. 2907.323(A)(3)."  37 Ohio St.3d at 258, 525 N.E.2d at 1373 (emphasis added).  Earlier in its opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court more carefully articulated its construction of the statute, and stated that \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3) criminalizes depictions of nudity "where such nudity constitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals."  37 Ohio St.3d at 252, 525 N.E.2d at 1368. It is on this portion of the opinion that I rely.</p>\n<p>The Ohio Supreme Court did not say, "[W]here such nudity constitutes a lewd exhibition <em>of</em> or involves a graphic focus on the genitals."  The noun "exhibition" does not take as a modifier the preposition "on," and the court\'s repeated reference to the "prohibited state of nudity" as "a lewd exhibition or a graphic focus on the genitals," 37 Ohio St.3d at 251, 525 N.E.2d at 1367, leaves no doubt that its choice of words was deliberate.  The Ohio court clearly meant the "lewd exhibition" standard to pertain only to nudity, and not to displays of the genitals.  <em>See also ibid.</em> (referring to "morally innocent states of nudity as well as lewd exhibitions").</p>\n<p>But were the Court today correct that the Ohio Supreme Court intended to create a "<em>lewd exhibition\' of the genitals" test, I would hardly be reassured.  Indeed, such a confused approach by the Ohio Supreme Court, referring in one part of its opinion to "lewd exhibitions of <em>nudity</em>" and in another to "lewd exhibitions of <em>the genitals,</em>" would create a great deal of uncertainty regarding the scope of \xc2\xa7 2907.323(A)(3), and likely would render that statute void for vagueness.

As it now reads, the Sex Offenses chapter of the Ohio Revised Code is remarkably <em>devoid</em> of any use of the term "lewd."  The crime of "importuning," for example, is defined as the solicitation to engage in "sexual activity" or "sexual conduct."  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2907.07 (1975).  "Public indecency" comprises "expos[ing one\'s] private parts," "engag[ing] in masturbation," "engag[ing] in sexual conduct," or "engag[ing] in conduct which to an ordinary observer would appear to be sexual conduct or masturbation."  \xc2\xa7 2907.09.  "Prostitution" is described as engaging in "sexual activity for hire."  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2907.21-2907.26 (1975 and Supp.1989).</p>\n<p>Currently, several sections of the Ohio Revised Code outside the Sex Offenses chapter contain the term "lewd."  <em>See</em> Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 715.52 (1976) ("Any municipal corporation may . . . [p]rovide for the punishment of all lewd and lascivious behavior in the streets and other public places"); Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3767.01(C) (1988) (defining public "nuisance" as "that which is defined and declared by statutes to be such and . . . any place in or upon which lewdness, assignation, or prostitution is conducted, permitted, continued, or exists, or any place, in or upon which lewd, indecent, lascivious, or obscene films or plate negatives [and so on, are exhibited]"); Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 4715.30(A) (Supp.1989) (providing that "[t]he holder of a certificate or license issued under this chapter is subject to disciplinary action by the state dental board for . . .

Indeed, although the Ohio public nuisance statute, \xc2\xa7 3767.01(C), contains the phrase "lewdness, assignation, or prostitution," it has been interpreted to refer only to conduct or behavior, and not to photographs and other printed materials.  <em>See Ohio v. Pizza,</em> No. L-88045, 18, 1989 WL 20263 (Ohio Ct.App., Mar. 10, 1989), p. 18.

To equate child pornography with state secrets is to read the narrow exception carved in footnote 11 of <em>Stanley</em> as swallowing the general rule that the case established.  <em>See State v.

Although our decisions even in the First Amendment area have taken special note of the paramount importance of national security interests, <em>see, e.g., Near v. Minnesota ex rel.

A restriction on speech cannot be justified by such self-referential reasoning.  In fact, the difficulty of enforcing possession laws -- for example, the requirements of probable cause and a warrant before a search may be undertaken -- means that penalties for possession are dubious complements to curbs on production, sale, and distribution.  <em>See</em> Note, Private Possession of Child Pornography:  The Tensions Between <em>Stanley v. Georgia</em> and <em>New York v. Ferber,</em> 29 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 187, 212 (1987) ("Statutory prohibition of the private possession of child pornography is an inefficient and ineffective means of preventing the serious problem of child sexual abuse").</p>\n<p>The federal experience illustrates that possession laws are not an essential element of a successful enforcement strategy.  In the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, P.L. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7, Congress prohibited the production, distribution, and sale of material depicting sexually explicit conduct by minors.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2251-2253 (1982 ed.).  Congress also criminalized the mailing, receipt, or trafficking in interstate or foreign commerce of such material for the purpose of sale or distribution for sale.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2252(a) (1982 ed.).  But Congress did <em>not</em> criminalize mere possession.  In the Child Protection Act of 1984, P.L. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204, Congress enacted a broad revision of the 1977 law removing the requirement that trafficking, receipt, and mailing be for the purposes of sale or distribution for sale.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2252(a).  Further, the 1984 Act eliminated a requirement that material be "obscene" before its production, distribution, sale, mailing, trafficking, and receipt could be found criminal, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 2252(a); raised the age limit of protection from 16 to 18 years of age, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 2256(1); and added stiffer penalties, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 2252(b), criminal and civil forfeiture provisions, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2253, 2254, and a civil remedy for personal injuries.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 2255.  Even in the 1984 amendments, Congress did not find it necessary to ban simple possession.  Nevertheless, the Attorney General\'s Commission on Pornography determined that</p>\n<p>"the 1977 Act effectively halted the bulk of the commercial child pornography industry, while the 1984 revisions have enabled federal officials to move against the noncommercial, clandestine mutation of that industry."</p>\n<p>1 U.S. Dept. of Justice, Attorney General\'s Commission on Pornography, Final Report 607 (1986).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court briefly identifies two other interests that it contends justify Ohio\'s law.  First, the majority describes a state interest in destroying the "permanen[t] record" of the victim\'s abuse.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#111">495 U. S. 111</a></span>.  I do not believe that the law is narrowly tailored to this end, for there is no requirement that the State show that the child was abused in the production of the materials, or even that the child knew that a photograph was taken.  Even if the State could recover all copies of the offensive picture, which seems highly unlikely, I do not see how a candid shot taken without the minor\'s knowledge can "haun[t]" him or her in the years to come, <em>ibid.,</em> when there is no indication that the child is even aware of its existence.  And if the law\'s purpose is preventing sexual abuse of children, it is under-inclusive to the extent that it does not prevent <em>parents</em> from photographing their children in a state of nudity, <em>see, e.g., Massachusetts v. Oakes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/576/case.html">491 U. S. 576</a></span> (1989), or giving others written permission to do so.  <em>See, e.g., Faloona v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,</em> 607 F.Supp. 1341 (ND Tex. 1985).  The only restriction on parents is the nebulous "proper purposes" provision, which is really no restriction at all.  <em>See</em> <l=|495 103fn2="" 2|="" u.s.="">n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  More fundamentally, even if the State could presume that minors are legally incompetent to consent to sexually explicit photographs, and therefore that all such photographs could be outlawed, it does not follow that the State can prohibit <em>possession</em> of such pictures in addition to their <em>production.</em>  In <em>Ferber,</em> the Court was careful to limit its discussion to the "distribution" and "circulation" of photographs taken without a minor\'s consent.  <em>See</em> 458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#759">458 U.

By analogy, <em>Stanley</em> assuredly protects the private possession of obscene adult pornography, even though an argument could be made that "production of adult pornography can be as harmful to adult actors as the production of child pornography is to child actors."

S. 111</a></span> (citing, in a footnote, the Attorney General\'s Commission on Pornography).  The Attorney General\'s Commission, however, determined that pedophiles are likely to use <em>adult</em> as well as <em>child</em> pornography to lower the inhibitions of a child victim.  <em>See</em> Attorney General\'s Report, <em>supra,</em> n. 16, at 686; <em>see also</em> Brief for Covenant House <em>et al.,</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8, n. 9 (characterizing the Court\'s argument on this point as "factual speculation").  Finally, Ohio\'s solution -- prohibiting private possession -- ignores fundamental principles of our First Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>"Assuming obscene material could be proved to create a . . . danger of illegal behavior, it would not follow that the expression should be suppressed.  Rather, the basic principles of a system of freedom of expression would require that society deal directly with the . . . action and leave the expression alone."</p>\n<p>T. Emerson The System of Freedom of Expression 494 (1970).  <em>See also Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#108">413 U. S. 108</a></span>-110 (BRENNAN, J. dissenting).  Thus, while acts of sexual abuse themselves may be outlawed, the private possession of photographs, magazines, and other materials may not.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/19" name="F2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]</p>\n<p>The notion that possession of pornography may be penalized in order to facilitate a prohibition on its production, whatever the rights of possessors, is not unlike a proposal that newspaper subscribers be held criminally liable for receiving the newspaper if they are aware of the publisher\'s violations of child labor laws.  <em>Cf.</em> L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 915 (2d ed. 1988).  In both cases, sanctions against possession might increase the effectiveness of concededly permissible regulations on the production process.  But. although the need to protect children from exploitation may be acute, it cannot override the right to receive the newspaper or to possess sexually explicit materials in the privacy of the home, especially when less restrictive alternatives exist to further the state interests asserted.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion should not be taken to mean that appellant\'s due process claim with respect to the "lewd exhibition" and "graphic focus" elements would be procedurally barred now had he failed to object at trial.  If appellant\'s due process contention were nothing more than a complaint concerning the statute\'s overbreadth, the suggestion that he would be barred from raising it now if he failed to object at trial might be plausible.  But that is not appellant\'s argument.  Rather, he maintains that his due process rights were violated because the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed his conviction after adding the elements of "lewd exhibition" and "graphic focus" on appeal, despite the fact that appellant had had no reason to design a defense strategy or introduce evidence with these tests in mind.  The jury, moreover, might have convicted appellant purely on the basis of the "nudity" definition, without deciding whether the materials depicted a "lewd exhibition of nudity" or involved a "graphic focus" on the genitals.  Thus, appellant\'s due process claim is separate from his overbreadth challenge, see <em>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html">382 U. S. 87</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/87/case.html#92">382 U. S. 92</a></span> (1965), as even the Court appears to recognize at some places in its opinion.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/103/case.html#121">495 U. S. 121</a></span> ("Even if construed to obviate overbreadth, applying the statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause").  The due process violation in this case was not complete until the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed appellant\'s conviction after reinterpreting the statute.  Requiring defendants to object at trial to an error that does not appear until the appellate stage would advance no legitimate state interest regarding finality or compliance with state procedures.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
