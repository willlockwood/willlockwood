Because we think it clear that Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys met the constitutional minimum of competence under the correct standard, we grant the petition and reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 18, 1985, Van Hook went to a Cincinnati bar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find someone to rob.  He approached David Self, and after the two spent several hours drinking together they left for Self\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.  There Van Hook \xe2\x80\x9clured Self into a vulnerable position\xe2\x80\x9d and attacked him, first strangling him until he was unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife and mutilating his body.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Hook</em>, 39 Ohio St. 3d 256, 256\xe2\x80\x93257, 530 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 883, 884 (1988).  Before fleeing with Self\xe2\x80\x99s valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover his tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body and smearing fingerprints he had left behind.  Six weeks later, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder, with one capital specification, and aggravated robbery.  He waived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel found him guilty of both charges and the capital specification.  At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight mitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an unsworn statement.  After weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the death penalty.  The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal, <em>id.</em>, at 265, 530 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 892;<em> State </em>v. <em>Van Hook</em>, No.\nC\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x930565, 1987 WL 11202 (Ohio App., May 13, 1987) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and we denied certiorari, <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/1100/index.html">489 U.

Van Hook also sought state postconviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Hook</em>, No. C\xe2\x80\x93910505, 1992 WL 308350 (Ohio App., Oct. 21, 1992) <em>(per curiam)</em>, appeal denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d 1440, 608 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1085, rehearing denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d 1470, 611 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 328 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Hook</em>, 70 Ohio St. 3d 1216, 639 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1199 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995.  The District Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims.  <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Anderson</em>, No. C\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9394\xe2\x80\x93269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a.  A panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s confession was unconstitutionally obtained under <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/index.html">451 U. S. 477</a> (1981).  See <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Anderson</em>, 444 F.\xc2\xa03d 830, 832 (2006).  The en banc<em> </em>Sixth Circuit vacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper, and it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s other claims.  See <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Anderson</em>, 488 F.\xc2\xa03d 411, 428 (2007).  Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we denied.  <em>Van Hook</em> v. <em>Hudson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/1023/index.html">552 U. S. 1023</a> (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief again, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys were ineffective during the penalty phase because they did not adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health expert, and requested and relied on a presentence investigation report without objecting to damaging evidence it contained.  See <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Anderson</em>, 535 F.\xc2\xa03d 458, 461 (2008).  The en banc<em> </em>Sixth Circuit again vacated the panel\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second time it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion.  See <em>Van Hook</em> v. <em>Anderson</em>, 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 523, 524 (2009).  In its third opinion, the panel\xe2\x80\x94relying on guidelines published by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003\xe2\x80\x94granted relief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers performed deficiently in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence.  See <em>id.</em>, at 525.  The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition before April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply.  See <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 327 (1997).  Even without the Act\xe2\x80\x99s added layer of deference to state-court judgments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Van Hook is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, representation that does not fall \xe2\x80\x9cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d in light of \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 686 (1984) (quoting <em>McMann</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/index.html">397 U. S. 759</a>, 771, n.\xc2\xa014 (1970)).  That standard is necessarily a general one.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo particular set of detailed rules for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S.<em>,</em> at 688\xe2\x80\x93689.  Restatements of professional standards, we have recognized, can be useful as \xe2\x80\x9cguides\xe2\x80\x9d to what reasonableness entails, but only to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place.  <em>Id.</em>, at 688.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying on ABA guidelines announced 18 years after Van Hook went to trial.  See 560 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 526\xe2\x80\x93528 (quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment., pp. 81\xe2\x80\x9383 (rev. ed. 2003)).  The ABA standards in effect in 1985 described defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duty to investigate both the merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms:  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4\xe2\x80\x934.1, p. 4\xe2\x80\x9353 (2d ed. 1980).  The accompanying two-page commentary noted that defense counsel have \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nformation concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the like, will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at  4\xe2\x80\x9355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite different are the ABA\xe2\x80\x99s 131-page \xe2\x80\x9cGuidelines\xe2\x80\x9d for capital defense counsel, published in 2003, on which the Sixth Circuit relied.  Those directives expanded what had been (in the 1980 Standards) a broad outline of defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duties in all criminal cases into detailed prescriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.  They discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence in exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look for, where to look, and when to begin.  See ABA Guidelines 10.7, comment., at 80\xe2\x80\x9385.  They include, for example, the requirement that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s investigation cover every period of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s life from \xe2\x80\x9cthe moment of conception,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 81, and that counsel contact \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually everyone\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0who knew [the defendant] and his family\xe2\x80\x9d and obtain records \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning not only the client, but also his parents, grandparents, siblings, and children,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 83.  Judging counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s on the basis of these 2003 Guidelines\xe2\x80\x94without even pausing to consider whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice at the time of the trial\xe2\x80\x94was error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following Circuit precedent) treated the ABA\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 Guidelines not merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys would do, but as inexorable commands with which all capital defense counsel \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must fully comply.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 526 (quoting <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>Bagley</em>, 453 F.\xc2\xa03d 690, 693 (CA6 2006)).  <em>Strickland</em> stressed, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Bar Association standards and the like\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9conly guides\xe2\x80\x9d to what reasonableness means, not its definition.  466 U. S., at 688.  We have since regarded them as such.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See<em> Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 524 (2003).  What we have said of state requirements is <em>a fortiori </em>true of standards set by private organizations: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile States are free to impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that criminal defendants are well represented, we have held that the Federal Constitution imposes one general requirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Flores-Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/470/index.html">528 U. S. 470</a>, 479 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Van Hook insists that the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s missteps made no difference because his counsel were ineffective even under professional standards prevailing at the time.  He is wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that his attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late, waiting until he was found guilty\xe2\x80\x94only days before the sentencing hearing\xe2\x80\x94to dig into his background.  See 560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 528.  But the record shows they started much sooner.  Between Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s indictment and his trial less than three months later, they contacted their lay witnesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his mother (beginning within a week after the indictment), once with both parents together, twice with an aunt who lived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a child, and three times with a family friend whom Van Hook visited immediately after the crime.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a\xe2\x80\x93383a, 384a\xe2\x80\x93387a.  As for their expert witnesses, they were in touch with one more than a month before trial, and they met with the other for two hours a week before the trial court reached its verdict.  <em>Id.</em>, at 382a, 386a.  Moreover, after reviewing his military history, they met with a representative of the Veterans Administration seven weeks before trial and attempted to obtain his medical records.  <em>Id.</em>, at 381a, 386a.  And they looked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial was still five weeks away.  <em>Id.</em>, at 386a.  The Sixth Circuit, in short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers waited until the \xe2\x80\x9clast minute.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 528.  Cf.<em> Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 395 (2000) (counsel waited \xe2\x80\x9cuntil a week before the trial\xe2\x80\x9d to prepare for the sentencing phase).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor was the scope of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s investigation unreasonable.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Sixth Circuit said Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys found only \xe2\x80\x9ca little information about his traumatic childhood experience,\xe2\x80\x9d 560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 528, but that is a gross distortion.  The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook (whose parents were both \xe2\x80\x9cheavy drinkers\xe2\x80\x9d) started drinking as a toddler, began \xe2\x80\x9cbarhopping\xe2\x80\x9d with his father at age 9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from age 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol into adulthood.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a\xe2\x80\x93312a, 323a\xe2\x80\x93326a, 328a\xe2\x80\x93330a, 373a.  The court also heard that Van Hook grew up in a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98combat zone\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d:  He watched his father beat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and knife-point, \xe2\x80\x9cobserved\xe2\x80\x9d episodes of \xe2\x80\x9csexual violence\xe2\x80\x9d while sleeping in his parents\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom, and was beaten himself at least once.  <em>Id.</em>, at 321a, 338a\xe2\x80\x93339a, 371a.  It learned that Van Hook, who had \xe2\x80\x9cfantasies about killing and war\xe2\x80\x9d from an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and alcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and attempted suicide five times (including a month before the murder), <em>id.</em>, at 351a\xe2\x80\x93353a, 372a.  And although the experts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a \xe2\x80\x9cmental disease or defect,\xe2\x80\x9d the trial court learned that Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s borderline personality disorder and his consumption of drugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired \xe2\x80\x9chis ability to refrain from the [crime],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 303a, and that his \xe2\x80\x9cexplo[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9csenseless and bizarre brutality\xe2\x80\x9d may have resulted from what one expert termed a \xe2\x80\x9chomosexual panic,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 376a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did present, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his counsel for failing to find more.  What his counsel did discover, the argument goes, gave them \xe2\x80\x9creason to suspect that much worse details existed,\xe2\x80\x9d and that suspicion should have prompted them to interview other family members\xe2\x80\x94his stepsister, two uncles, and two aunts\xe2\x80\x94as well as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of whom \xe2\x80\x9ccould have helped his counsel narrate the true story of Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s childhood experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 528.  But there comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties.  The ABA Standards prevailing at the time called for Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to cover several broad categories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards\n4\xe2\x80\x934.1, comment., at 4\xe2\x80\x9355, which they did.  And given all the evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing and the experts who reviewed his history, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify and interview every other living family member or every therapist who once treated his parents.  This is not a case in which the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys failed to act while potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in the face, cf. <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 525, or would have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained, cf. <em>Rompilla</em> v. <em>Beard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/374/index.html">545 U. S. 374</a>, 389\xe2\x80\x93393 (2005).  It is instead a case, like <em>Strickland </em>itself, in which defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecision not to seek more\xe2\x80\x9d mitigating evidence from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background \xe2\x80\x9cthan was already in hand\xe2\x80\x9d fell \xe2\x80\x9cwell within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 699.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, even if Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s counsel performed deficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no prejudice as a result.  See <em>id.</em>, at 694.<em> </em>As the Ohio court that rejected Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas petition found, the affidavits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows their testimony would have added nothing of value.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Van Hook</em>, No. C\xe2\x80\x93910505, 1992 WL 308350, *2.  Only two witnesses even arguably would have added new, relevant information: One of Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s uncles noted that Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s mother was temporarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, and Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s stepsister mentioned that his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a.  But the trial court had already heard\xe2\x80\x94from Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s mother herself\xe2\x80\x94that she had been \xe2\x80\x9cunder psychiatric care\xe2\x80\x9d more than once.  <em>Id.</em>, at 340a.  And it was already aware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least once.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 305a (noting that Van Hook \xe2\x80\x9csuffered from a significant degree of neglect and abuse\xe2\x80\x9d throughout his \xe2\x80\x9cchaotic\xe2\x80\x9d childhood).<em> </em>Neither the Court of Appeals nor Van Hook has shown why the minor additional details the trial court did not hear would have made any difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evidence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court found: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the course of an aggravated robbery.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72929.04(A)(7) (Lexis 2006).  Van Hook\xe2\x80\x99s confession made clear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was the sole perpetrator of the crime and that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]is intention from beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in their evening\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; see <em>id.</em>, at 276a\xe2\x80\x93278a, 294a.  Nor did he arrive at that intention on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the same strategy\xe2\x80\x94of luring homosexual men into secluded settings to rob them\xe2\x80\x94many times since his teenage years, and he employed it again even after Self\xe2\x80\x99s murder in the weeks before his arrest.  See <em>id.</em>, at 279a, 295a, 374a.  Although Van Hook apparently deviated from his original plan once the offense was underway\xe2\x80\x94going beyond stealing Self\xe2\x80\x99s goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead body\xe2\x80\x94that hardly helped his cause.  The Sixth Circuit, which focused on the <em>number</em> of aggravating factors instead of their <em>weight</em>, see 560 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 530; cf. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72929.04(B), gave all this evidence short shrift, leading it to overstate further the effect additional mitigating evidence might have had.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.

But he offers no support for that assertion.  He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or present records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but the record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written expert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would have gleaned from the latter, see<em> id.</em>, at 373a\xe2\x80\x93377a.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963077">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n558 U.

The ABA is a venerable organization with a history of service to the bar, but it is, after all, a private group with limited membership.  The views of the association\xe2\x80\x99s members, not to mention the views of the members of the advisory committee that formulated the 2003 Guidelines, do not necessarily reflect the views of the American bar as a whole.  It is the responsibility of the courts to determine the nature of the work that a defense attorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the obligations imposed by the Constitution, and I see no reason why the ABA Guidelines should be given a privileged position in making that determination.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
