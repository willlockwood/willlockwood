OREGON et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93623.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 5, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 17, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">The Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act), which was enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances, criminalizes, <em>inter alia</em>, the unauthorized distribution and dispensation of substances classified in any of its five schedules.  The Attorney General may add, remove, or reschedule substances only after making particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters, he must accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).  These proceedings must be on the record after an opportunity for comment.  The dispute here involves controlled substances listed in Schedule II, which are generally available only by written prescription, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7829(a).  A 1971 regulation promulgated by the Attorney General requires that such prescriptions be used \xe2\x80\x9cfor a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04.  To prevent diversion of controlled substances, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians, who must register in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.  He may deny, suspend, or revoke a registration that, as relevant here, would be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7824(a)(4), 822(a)(2).  In determining consistency with the public interest, he must consider five factors, including the State\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, compliance with state, federal, and local law regarding controlled substances, and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7823(f).  The CSA explicitly contemplates a role for the States in regulating controlled substances.  See \xc2\xa7903.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA) exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with ODWDA\xe2\x80\x99s specific safeguards, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient.  In 2001, the Attorney General issued an Interpretive Rule to address the implementation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA, declaring that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA.  The State, a physician, a pharmacist, and some terminally ill state residents challenged the Rule.  The District Court permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Ninth Circuit invalidated the Rule, reasoning that, by making a medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, it altered the balance between the States and the Federal Government without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized the action; and in the alternative, that the Rule could not be squared with the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, which targets only conventional drug abuse and excludes the Attorney General from medical policy decisions.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The CSA does not allow the Attorney General to prohibit doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide under state law permitting the procedure.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0An administrative rule interpreting the issuing agency\xe2\x80\x99s own ambiguous regulation may receive substantial deference.  <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461\xe2\x80\x93463.  So may an interpretation of an ambiguous statute, <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93845, but only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  Otherwise, the interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to respect\xe2\x80\x9d only to the extent it has the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to persuade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Interpretive Rule at issue is not entitled to <em>Auer</em> deference as an interpretation of 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04.  Unlike the underlying regulations in <em>Auer,</em> which gave specificity to a statutory scheme the Secretary of Labor was charged with enforcing and reflected the Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s considerable experience and expertise, the underlying regulation here does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.  The CSA allows prescription of drugs that have a \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently accepted medical use,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(b); requires a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, \xc2\xa7829(c); and defines a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid prescription\xe2\x80\x9d as one \xe2\x80\x9cissued for a legitimate medical purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  Similarly, physicians are considered practitioners if they dispense controlled substances \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of professional practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(21).  The regulation just repeats two of these statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others.  An agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language.  Furthermore, any statutory authority for the Interpretive Rule would have to come from 1984 CSA amendments adding the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, but 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 was adopted in 1971.  That the current interpretation runs counter to the intent at the time of the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s promulgation is an additional reason why <em>Auer </em>deference is unwarranted.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Interpretive Rule is also not entitled to <em>Chevron</em> deference.  The statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous in the relevant sense.  However, <em>Chevron</em> deference is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.  A rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.  The specific respects in which the Attorney General is authorized to make rules under the CSA show that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard for patient care and treatment specifically authorized under state law.  Congress delegated to the Attorney General only the authority to promulgate rules relating to \xe2\x80\x9cregistration\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d of the dispensing of controlled substances, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa7821, and \xe2\x80\x9cfor the efficient execution of his [statutory] functions,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7871(b).  Control means \xe2\x80\x9cto add a \xe2\x80\xa6 substance to a schedule,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7802(5), following specified procedures.  Because the Interpretive Rule does not concern scheduling of substances and was not issued under the required procedures, it cannot fall under the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s control authority.  Even if \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it could not support the Interpretive Rule.  Nor can the Interpretive Rule be justified under the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s registration provisions.  It does not undertake the Act\xe2\x80\x99s five-factor analysis for determining when registration is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7823(f), and it deals with much more than registration.  It purports to declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority going well beyond the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s statutory power to register or deregister physicians.  It would be anomalous for Congress to have painstakingly described the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s limited authority to deregister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of activity outside the course of professional practice and therefore a criminal violation of the CSA.  It is not enough that \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFederal law\xe2\x80\x9d are used in the part of the Act over which the Attorney General has authority.  Cf. <em>Sutton</em> v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/471/index.html">527 U. S. 471</a>.  The first two terms do not call on the Attorney General, or any Executive official, to make an independent assessment of the meaning of federal law.  The Attorney General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an application of the five-factor test generally, or the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d factor specifically.  Even if he had, it is doubtful that he could cite those factors to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.  The federal-law factor requires the Attorney General to decide \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the law but does not suggest that he may decide what the law is.  To say that he can define the substantive standards of medical practice as part of his authority would also put 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7871(b) in considerable tension with the narrowly defined control and registration delegation.  It would go, moreover, against the plain language of the text to treat a delegation for the \xe2\x80\x9cexecution\xe2\x80\x9d of his functions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s specific grants of authority.  The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s design in other fundamental respects, <em>e.g., </em>the Attorney General must share power with, and in some respect defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise delineated and confined by the Act.  Postenactment congressional commentary on the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s claimed authority.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a legal, not medical, one does not suffice, for the Interpretive Rule places extensive reliance on medical judgments and views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose.  The idea that Congress gave him such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation is not sustainable.  The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is unpersuasive under <em>Skidmore</em>.  The CSA and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law amply support the conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.  Beyond this, the Act manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally, which is understandable given federalism\xe2\x80\x99s structure and limitations.  The CSA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and operation presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States\xe2\x80\x99 police powers.  The Federal Government can set uniform standards for regulating health and safety.  In connection with the CSA, however, the only provision in which Congress set general, uniform medical practice standards, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72990bb2a, strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit statutory language.  The difficulty in defending the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that the CSA impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide is compounded by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s limited objectives.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the terms \xe2\x80\x9cmedical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine\xe2\x80\x9d refer to a healing or curative art, and thus cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s death, rests on a reading of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7829(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prescription requirement without the illumination of the rest of the statute.  Viewed in context, that requirement is better understood as ensuring that patients use controlled substances under a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s supervision so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse.  To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as \xe2\x80\x9cdrug abuse\xe2\x80\x9d under the CSA is discordant with the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s consistent use throughout the Act, not to mention its ordinary meaning.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA and the Act\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers.

As the Court has observed, \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington </em>v.<em> Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 735 (1997).  The dispute before us is in part a product of this political and moral debate, but its resolution requires an inquiry familiar to the courts: interpreting a federal statute to determine whether Executive action is authorized by, or otherwise consistent with, the enactment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994, Oregon became the first State to legalize assisted suicide when voters approved a ballot measure enacting the Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA).  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7127.800 <em>et seq.</em> (2003). ODWDA, which survived a 1997 ballot measure seeking its repeal, exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with the specific safeguards in ODWDA, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The drugs Oregon physicians prescribe under ODWDA are regulated under a federal statute, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act).  84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq</em>.  The CSA allows these particular drugs to be available only by a written prescription from a registered physician.  In the ordinary course the same drugs are prescribed in smaller doses for pain alleviation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A November 9, 2001 Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General addresses the implementation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA.  It determines that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA.  The Interpretive Rule\xe2\x80\x99s validity under the CSA is the issue before us.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn first to the text and structure of the CSA.  Enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances, the CSA creates a comprehensive, closed regulatory regime criminalizing the unauthorized manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of substances classified in any of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s five schedules.  <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Raich</em>, 545 U. S. ____, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310); 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844.  The Act places substances in one of five schedules based on their potential for abuse or dependence, their accepted medical use, and their accepted safety for use under medical supervision.  Schedule I contains the most severe restrictions on access and use, and Schedule V the least.  <em>Raich</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 11); 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812.  Congress classified a host of substances when it enacted the CSA, but the statute permits the Attorney General to add, remove, or reschedule substances.  He may do so, however, only after making particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters he is required to accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).  These proceedings must be on the record after an opportunity for comment.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7811 (main ed. and Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present dispute involves controlled substances listed in Schedule II, substances generally available only pursuant to a written, nonrefillable prescription by a physician.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7829(a).  A 1971 regulation promulgated by the Attorney General requires that every prescription for a controlled substance \xe2\x80\x9cbe issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04(a) (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To prevent diversion of controlled substances with medical uses, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians.  To issue lawful prescriptions of Schedule II drugs, physicians must \xe2\x80\x9cobtain from the Attorney General a registration issued in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by him.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7822(a)(2).  The Attorney General may deny, suspend, or revoke this registration if, as relevant here, the physician\xe2\x80\x99s registration would be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7824(a)(4); \xc2\xa7822(a)(2).

For Oregon residents to be eligible to request a prescription under ODWDA, they must receive a diagnosis from their attending physician that they have an incurable and irreversible disease that, within reasonable medical judgment, will cause death within six months.  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7127.815, 127.800(12) (2003).  Attending physicians must also determine whether a patient has made a voluntary request, ensure a patient\xe2\x80\x99s choice is informed, and refer patients to counseling if they might be suffering from a psychological disorder or depression causing impaired judgment.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7127.815, 127.825.  A second \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting\xe2\x80\x9d physician must examine the patient and the medical record and confirm the attending physician\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions.  \xc2\xa7127.800(8).

The letter received an initial, favorable response from the director of the DEA, see Letter from Thomas A. Constantine to Sen. Orrin Hatch (Nov. 5, 1997), Hearings 4\xe2\x80\x935, but Attorney General Reno considered the matter and concluded that the DEA could not take the proposed action because the CSA did not authorize it to \xe2\x80\x9cdisplace the states as the primary regulators of the medical profession, or to override a state\xe2\x80\x99s determination as to what constitutes legitimate medical practice,\xe2\x80\x9d Letter from Attorney General Janet Reno to Sen.

Perhaps because Mr. Ashcroft had supported efforts to curtail assisted suicide while serving as a Senator, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 143 Cong. Rec. 5589\xe2\x80\x935590 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Ashcroft), Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers wrote him to request a meeting with Department of Justice officials should the Department decide to revisit the application of the CSA to assisted suicide.  Letter of Feb. 2, 2001, App. to Brief for Patient-Respondents in Opposition 55a.  Attorney General Myers received a reply letter from one of Attorney General Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s advisers writing on his behalf, which stated</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware of no pending legislation in Congress that would prompt a review of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the CSA as it relates to physician-assisted suicide.  Should such a review be commenced in the future, we would be happy to include your views in that review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Lori Sharpe (Apr. 17, 2001), <em>id.,</em> at 58a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 9, 2001, without consulting Oregon or apparently anyone outside his Department, the Attorney General issued an Interpretive Rule announcing his intent to restrict the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide.  Incorporating the legal analysis of a memorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal Counsel, the Attorney General ruled</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cassisting suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x98legitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of 21 CFR 1306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the Controlled Substances Act.  Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may \xe2\x80\x98render his registration . . . inconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x99 and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 824(a)(4).  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion applies regardless of whether state law authorizes or permits such conduct by practitioners or others and regardless of the condition of the person whose suicide is assisted.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is little dispute that the Interpretive Rule would substantially disrupt the ODWDA regime.  Respondents contend, and petitioners do not dispute, that every prescription filled under ODWDA has specified drugs classified under Schedule II.  A physician cannot prescribe the substances without DEA registration, and revocation or suspension of the registration would be a severe restriction on medical practice.  Dispensing controlled substances without a valid prescription, furthermore, is a federal crime.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Moore,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/122/index.html">423 U.

The United States District Court for the District of Oregon entered a permanent injunction against the Interpretive Rule\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the petitions for review and held the Interpretive Rule invalid.  <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 368 F.\xc2\xa03d 1118 (2004).  It reasoned that, by making a medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, the Interpretive Rule altered the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cusual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized such action.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1124\xe2\x80\x931125 (quoting <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/452/index.html">501 U.

The parties before us are in sharp disagreement both as to the degree of deference we must accord the Interpretive Rule\xe2\x80\x99s substantive conclusions and whether the Rule is authorized by the statutory text at all.  Although balancing the necessary respect for an agency\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, expertise, and constitutional office with the courts\xe2\x80\x99 role as interpreter of laws can be a delicate matter, familiar principles guide us.  An administrative rule may receive substantial deference if it interprets the issuing agency\xe2\x80\x99s own ambiguous regulation.  <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461\xe2\x80\x93463 (1997).  An interpretation of an ambiguous statute may also receive substantial deference.  <em>Chevron U. S. A.

Deference in accordance with <em>Chevron</em>, however, is warranted only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

Otherwise, the interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to respect\xe2\x80\x9d only to the extent it has the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to persuade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140 (1944).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government first argues that the Interpretive Rule is an elaboration of one of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s own regulations, 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 (2005), which requires all prescriptions be issued \xe2\x80\x9cfor a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  As such, the Government says, the Interpretive Rule is entitled to considerable deference in accordance with <em>Auer</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view <em>Auer</em> and the standard of deference it accords to an agency are inapplicable here.  <em>Auer</em> involved a disputed interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as applied to a class of law enforcement officers.  Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, an exemption from overtime pay depended, in part, on whether the employees met the \xe2\x80\x9csalary basis\xe2\x80\x9d test.  519 U. S., at 454\xe2\x80\x93455.  In this Court the Secretary of Labor filed an <em>amicus</em> brief explaining why, in his view, the regulations gave exempt status to the officers.  <em>Id.,</em> at 461.  We gave weight to that interpretation, holding that because the applicable test was \xe2\x80\x9ca creature of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s own regulations, his interpretation of it is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Auer</em>, the underlying regulations gave specificity to a statutory scheme the Secretary was charged with enforcing and reflected the considerable experience and expertise the Department of Labor had acquired over time with respect to the complexities of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Here, on the other hand, the underlying regulation does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.  The language the Interpretive Rule addresses comes from Congress, not the Attorney General, and the near-equivalence of the statute and regulation belies the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument for <em>Auer</em> deference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government does not suggest that its interpretation turns on any difference between the statutory and regulatory language.  The CSA allows prescription of drugs only if they have a \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently accepted medical use,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(b); requires a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, \xc2\xa7829(c); and, in its reporting provision, defines a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid prescription\xe2\x80\x9d as one \xe2\x80\x9cissued for a legitimate medical purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  Similarly, physicians are considered to be acting as practitioners under the statute if they dispense controlled substances \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of professional practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7802(21).  The regulation uses the terms \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe course of professional practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> but this just repeats two statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others.  It gives little or no instruction on a central issue in this case: Who decides whether a particular activity is in \xe2\x80\x9cthe course of professional practice\xe2\x80\x9d or done for a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d?  Since the regulation gives no indication how to decide this issue, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s effort to decide it now cannot be considered an interpretation of the regulation.  Simply put, the existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.  An agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, as explained below, if there is statutory authority to issue the Interpretive Rule it comes from the 1984 amendments to the CSA that gave the Attorney General authority to register and deregister physicians based on the public interest.  The regulation was enacted before those amendments, so the Interpretive Rule cannot be justified as indicative of some intent the Attorney General had in 1971.  That the current interpretation runs counter to the \xe2\x80\x9cintent at the time of the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s promulgation,\xe2\x80\x9d is an additional reason why <em>Auer</em> deference is unwarranted.  <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ.</em> v. <em>Shalala,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/504/index.html">512 U. S. 504</a>, 512 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Deference under <em>Auer</em> being inappropriate, we turn to the question whether the Interpretive Rule, on its own terms, is a permissible interpretation of the CSA.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as the Interpretive Rule receives no deference under <em>Auer</em>, neither does it receive deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  If a statute is ambiguous, judicial review of administrative rulemaking often demands <em>Chevron</em> deference; and the rule is judged accordingly.  All would agree, we should think, that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is a generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions, and thus ambiguous in the relevant sense.  <em>Chevron</em> deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.  To begin with, the rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.  <em>Mead, </em>533 U. S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Attorney General has rulemaking power to fulfill his duties under the CSA.  The specific respects in which he is authorized to make rules, however, instruct us that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard for care and treatment of patients that is specifically authorized under state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the language of the delegation provision itself.  In many cases authority is clear because the statute gives an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services,</em> 545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 8) (explaining that a Federal Communications Commission regulation received <em>Chevron</em> deference because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has delegated to the Commission the authority to . . . \xe2\x80\x98prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 47 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7201(b))); <em>Household Credit Services, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pfennig,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/232/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/232/index.html">541 U. S. 232</a>, 238 (2004) (giving <em>Chevron</em> deference to a Federal Reserve Board regulation where \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has expressly delegated to the Board the authority to prescribe regulations . . . as, in the judgment of the Board, \xe2\x80\x98are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the statute (quoting 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71604(a))).  The CSA does not grant the Attorney General this broad authority to promulgate rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSA gives the Attorney General limited powers, to be exercised in specific ways.  His rulemaking authority under the CSA is described in two provisions: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances and to listed chemicals,\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7821 (Supp. 2005); and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General may promulgate and enforce any rules, regulations, and procedures which he may deem necessary and appropriate for the efficient execution of his functions under this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7871(b).  As is evident from these sections, Congress did not delegate to the Attorney General authority to carry out or effect all provisions of the CSA.  Rather, he can promulgate rules relating only to \xe2\x80\x9cregistration\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfor the efficient execution of his functions\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning first to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to make regulations for the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d of drugs, this delegation cannot sustain the Interpretive Rule\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to define standards of medical practice.  Control is a term of art in the CSA.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs used in this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7802\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93the subchapter that includes \xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98control\xe2\x80\x99 means to add a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, to a schedule under part B of this subchapter, whether by transfer from another schedule or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7802(5). </p>\n<p align="left">\nTo exercise his scheduling power, the Attorney General must follow a detailed set of procedures, including requesting a scientific and medical evaluation from the Secretary.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811, 812 (main ed. and Supp. 2005).  The statute is also specific as to the manner in which the Attorney General must exercise this authority: \xe2\x80\x9cRules of the Attorney General under this subsection [regarding scheduling] shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7553].\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7811(a).  The Interpretive Rule now under consideration does not concern the scheduling of substances and was not issued after\nthe required procedures for rules regarding scheduling, so it cannot fall under the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d\nauthority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule.  The statutory references to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d outside the scheduling context make clear that the Attorney General can establish controls \xe2\x80\x9cagainst diversion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7823(a)(1), but do not give him authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice.  As explained below, the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s express limitations on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority, and other indications from the statutory scheme, belie any notion that the Attorney General has been granted this implicit authority.  Indeed, if \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d were given the expansive meaning required to sustain the Interpretive Rule, it would transform the carefully described limits on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority over registration and scheduling into mere suggestions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn, next, to the registration provisions of the CSA.  Before 1984, the Attorney General was required to register any physician who was authorized by his State.  The Attorney General could only deregister a physician who falsified his application, was convicted of a felony relating to controlled substances, or had his state license or registration revoked.  See 84 Stat. 1255.  The CSA was amended in 1984 to allow the Attorney General to deny registration to an applicant \xe2\x80\x9cif he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7823(f).  Registration may also be revoked or suspended by the Attorney General on the same grounds.  \xc2\xa7824(a)(4).  In determining consistency with the public interest, the Attorney General must, as discussed above, consider five factors, including: the State\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation; compliance with state, federal, and local laws regarding controlled substances; and public health and safety.  \xc2\xa7823(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Interpretive Rule cannot be justified under this part of the statute.  It does not undertake the five-factor analysis and concerns much more than registration.  Nor does the Interpretive Rule on its face purport to be an application of the registration provision in \xc2\xa7823(f).  It is, instead, an interpretation of the substantive federal law requirements (under 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 (2005)) for a valid prescription.  It begins by announcing that assisting suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71306.04, and that dispensing controlled substances to assist a suicide violates the CSA.  66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).  Violation is a criminal offense, and often a felony, under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  The Interpretive Rule thus purports to declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority that goes well beyond the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s statutory power to register or deregister.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s deregistration power, of course, may carry implications for criminal enforcement because if a physician dispenses a controlled substance after he is deregistered, he violates \xc2\xa7841.  The Interpretive Rule works in the opposite direction, however: it declares certain conduct criminal, placing in jeopardy the registration of any physician who engages in that conduct.  To the extent the Interpretive Rule concerns registration, it simply states the obvious because one of the five factors the Attorney General must consider in deciding the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7823(f)(4).  The problem with the design of the Interpretive Rule is that it cannot, and does not, explain why the Attorney General has the authority to decide what constitutes an underlying violation of the CSA in the first place.  The explanation the Government seems to advance is that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to decide whether a physician\xe2\x80\x99s actions are inconsistent with the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d provides the basis for the Interpretive Rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By this logic, however, the Attorney General claims extraordinary authority.  If the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s argument were correct, his power to deregister necessarily would include the greater power to criminalize even the actions of registered physicians, whenever they engage in conduct he deems illegitimate.  This power to criminalize\xe2\x80\x94unlike his power over registration, which must be exercised only after considering five express statutory factors\xe2\x80\x94would be unrestrained.  It would be anomalous for Congress to have so painstakingly described the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s limited authority to deregister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of activity outside \xe2\x80\x9cthe course of professional practice,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore a criminal violation of the CSA.  See <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>Seatrain Lines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/726/index.html">411 U. S. 726</a>, 744 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn light of these specific grants of . . . authority, we are unwilling to construe the ambiguous provisions . . . to serve this purpose [of creating further authority]\xe2\x80\x94a purpose for which it obviously was not intended\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sutton</em> v. <em>United Air Lines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/471/index.html">527 U.

C. \xc2\xa712116, and the section of the statute defining \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d was in a different subchapter.  The Court did not accept the idea that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe employment subchapter, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x98<em>this</em> subchapter,\xe2\x80\x99 includes other provisions that use the defined terms, . . . [t]he EEOC might elaborate, through regulations, on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98disability\xe2\x80\x99 . . . if elaboration is needed in order to \xe2\x80\x98carry out\xe2\x80\x99 the substantive provisions of \xe2\x80\x98this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U.

It is not enough that the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFederal law\xe2\x80\x9d are used in the part of the statute over which the Attorney General has authority.  The statutory terms \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health\xe2\x80\x9d do not call on the Attorney General, or any other Executive official, to make an independent assessment of the meaning of federal law.  The Attorney General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an application of the five-factor test generally, or the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d factor specifically.  Even if he had, it is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health\xe2\x80\x9d to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the federal law factor, though it does require the Attorney General to decide \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the law, it does not suggest that he may decide what the law says.  Were it otherwise, the Attorney General could authoritatively interpret \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clocal laws,\xe2\x80\x9d which are also included in 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7823(f), despite the obvious constitutional problems in his doing so.  Just as he must evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding about registration, the Attorney General must as surely evaluate compliance with federal law in deciding whether to prosecute; but this does not entitle him to <em>Chevron</em> deference.  See <em>Crandon</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/152/index.html">494 U. S. 152</a>, 177 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Justice Department, of course, has a very specific responsibility to determine for itself what this statute means, in order to decide when to prosecute; but we have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limits on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to define medical standards for the care and treatment of patients bear also on the proper interpretation of \xc2\xa7871(b).  This section allows the Attorney General to best determine how to execute \xe2\x80\x9chis functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is quite a different matter, however, to say that the Attorney General can define the substantive standards of medical practice as part of his authority.  To find a delegation of this extent in \xc2\xa7871 would put that part of the statute in considerable tension with the narrowly defined delegation concerning control and registration.  It would go, moreover, against the plain language of the text to treat a delegation for the \xe2\x80\x9cexecution\xe2\x80\x9d of his functions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond the statute\xe2\x80\x99s specific grants of authority.  When Congress chooses to delegate a power of this extent, it does so not by referring back to the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s functions but by giving authority over the provisions of the statute he is to interpret.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., </em>545 U. S. ___; <em>Household Credit Services, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/232/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/232/index.html">541 U. S. 232</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent with the design of the statute in other fundamental respects.  The Attorney General does not have the sole delegated authority under the CSA.  He must instead share it with, and in some respects defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise delineated and confined by the statute.  The CSA allocates decisionmaking powers among statutory actors so that medical judgments, if they are to be decided at the federal level and for the limited objects of the statute, are placed in the hands of the Secretary.  In the scheduling context, for example, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations on scientific and medical matters bind the Attorney General.  The Attorney General cannot control a substance if the Secretary disagrees.  21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7811(b).  See H. R. Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x931444, pt. 1, p. 33 (1970) (the section \xe2\x80\x9cis not intended to authorize the Attorney General to undertake or support medical and scientific research [for the purpose of scheduling], which is within the competence of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a similar vein the 1970 Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of medical practice with respect to drug rehabilitation gives the Attorney General a limited role; for it is the Secretary who, after consultation with the Attorney General and national medical groups, \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine[s] the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of \xe2\x80\xa6 narcotic addiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7290bb\xe2\x80\x932a; see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (stating that the Attorney General shall register practitioners who dispense drugs for narcotics treatment when the Secretary has determined the applicant is qualified to treat addicts and the Attorney General has concluded the applicant will comply with record keeping and security regulations); <em>Moore,</em> 423 U. S., at 144 (noting that in enacting the addiction-treatment provisions, Congress sought to change the fact \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecutions\xe2\x80\x99 in the past had turned on the opinions of federal prosecutors\xe2\x80\x9d); H.

All decisions of a medical nature are to be made by the Secretary . . . .

In 1978, in preparation for ratification of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979\xe2\x80\x931980] 32 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 543, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 9725, Congress decided it would implement the United States\xe2\x80\x99 compliance through \xe2\x80\x9cthe framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of substances provided in the\xe2\x80\x9d CSA.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801a(3).  It did so to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this country as determined by [the Secretary] on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American medical and scientific community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The structure of the CSA, then, conveys unwillingness to cede medical judgments to an Executive official who lacks medical expertise.  In interpreting statutes that divide authority, the Court has recognized: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause historical familiarity and policymaking expertise account in the first instance for the presumption that Congress delegates interpretive lawmaking power to the agency rather than to the reviewing court, we presume here that Congress intended to invest interpretive power in the administrative actor in the best position to develop these attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/144/index.html">499 U. S. 144</a>, 153 (1991) (citations omitted).  This presumption works against a conclusion that the Attorney General has authority to make quintessentially medical judgments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision here is a legal, not a medical, one.  This generality, however, does not suffice.  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Interpretive Rule, and the Office of Legal Counsel memo it incorporates, place extensive reliance on medical judgments and the views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cmedical\xe2\x80\x9d distinctions between assisting suicide and giving sufficient medication to alleviate pain); Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General (June 27, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a\xe2\x80\x93122a, and n. 17 (discussing the \xe2\x80\x9cFederal medical policy\xe2\x80\x9d against physician-assisted suicide), <em>id.,</em> at 124a\xe2\x80\x93130a (examining views of the medical community).  This confirms that the authority claimed by the Attorney General is both beyond his expertise and incongruous with the statutory purposes and design.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The idea that Congress gave the Attorney General such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation in the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s registration provision is not sustainable.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions\xe2\x80\x94it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001); see <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 160 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are confident that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide, which has been the subject of an \xe2\x80\x9cearnest and profound debate\xe2\x80\x9d across the country, <em>Glucksberg,</em> 521 U. S., at 735, makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory, moreover, the medical judgments the Attorney General could make are not limited to physician-assisted suicide.  Were this argument accepted, he could decide whether any particular drug may be used for any particular purpose, or indeed whether a physician who administers any controversial treatment could be deregistered.  This would occur, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, despite the statute\xe2\x80\x99s express limitation of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to registration and control, with attendant restrictions on each of those functions, and despite the statutory purposes to combat drug abuse and prevent illicit drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide whether <em>Chevron</em> deference would be warranted for an interpretation issued by the Attorney General concerning matters closer to his role under the CSA, namely preventing doctors from engaging in illicit drug trafficking.  In light of the foregoing, however, the CSA does not give the Attorney General authority to issue the Interpretive Rule as a statement with the force of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, in the course of exercising his authority, the Attorney General uses his analysis in the Interpretive Rule only for guidance in deciding when to prosecute or deregister, then the question remains whether his substantive interpretation is correct.  Since the Interpretive Rule was not promulgated pursuant to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority, its interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d does not receive <em>Chevron</em> deference.  Instead, it receives deference only in accordance with <em>Skidmore</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\xe2\x80\x9d  323 U. S., at 140; see also <em>Mead,</em> 533 U. S., at 235 (noting that an opinion receiving <em>Skidmore</em> deference may \xe2\x80\x9cclaim the merit of its writer\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other sources of weight\xe2\x80\x9d).  The deference here is tempered by the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s lack of expertise in this area and the apparent absence of any consultation with anyone outside the Department of Justice who might aid in a reasoned judgment.  In any event, under <em>Skidmore</em>, we follow an agency\xe2\x80\x99s rule only to the extent it is persuasive, see <em>Christensen</em> v. <em>Harris County, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/576/index.html">529 U. S. 576</a>, 587 (2000); and for the reasons given and for further reasons set out below, we do not find the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s opinion persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have noted before, the CSA \xe2\x80\x9crepealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Raich</em>, 545 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  In doing so, Congress sought to \xe2\x80\x9cconquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It comes as little surprise, then, that we have not considered the extent to which the CSA regulates medical practice beyond prohibiting a doctor from acting as a drug \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pusher\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d instead of a physician.  <em>Moore</em>, 423 U. S.,<em> </em>at 143.  In <em>Moore</em>, we addressed a situation in which a doctor \xe2\x80\x9csold drugs, not for legitimate purposes, but primarily for the profits to be derived therefrom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 135 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x931444, pt. 1, at 10; internal quotation marks omitted).  There the defendant, who had engaged in large-scale overprescribing of methadone, \xe2\x80\x9cconcede[d] in his brief that he did not observe generally accepted medical practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  423 U. S., at 126.  And in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/483/index.html">532 U. S. 483</a> (2001), Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express determination that marijuana had no accepted medical use foreclosed any argument about statutory coverage of drugs available by a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescription.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding whether the CSA can be read as prohibiting physician-assisted suicide, we look to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and design.  The statute and our case law amply support the conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.  Beyond this, however, the statute manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally.  The silence is understandable given the structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U.

S. 724</a>, 756 (1985)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States\xe2\x80\x99 police powers.  The Attorney General can register a physician to dispense controlled substances \xe2\x80\x9cif the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of the State in which he practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f).  When considering whether to revoke a physician\xe2\x80\x99s registration, the Attorney General looks not just to violations of federal drug laws; but he \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d also consider \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he recommendation of the appropriate state licensing board or professional disciplinary authority\xe2\x80\x9d and the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with state and local drug laws.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The very definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cpractitioner\xe2\x80\x9d eligible to prescribe includes physicians \xe2\x80\x9clicensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he practices\xe2\x80\x9d to dispense controlled substances.  \xc2\xa7802(21).  Further cautioning against the conclusion that the CSA effectively displaces the States\xe2\x80\x99 general regulation of medical practice is the Act\xe2\x80\x99s  pre-emption provision, which indicates that, absent a positive conflict, none of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions should be \xe2\x80\x9cconstrued as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates \xe2\x80\xa6 to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7903.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s regime is an example of the state regulation of medical practice that the CSA presupposes.  Rather than simply decriminalizing assisted suicide, ODWDA limits its exercise to the attending physicians of terminally ill patients, physicians who must be licensed by Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Medical Examiners.  Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7127.815, 127.800(10) (2003).  The statute gives attending physicians a central role, requiring them to provide prognoses and prescriptions, give information about palliative alternatives and counseling, and ensure patients are competent and acting voluntarily.  \xc2\xa7127.815.  Any eligible patient must also get a second opinion from another registered physician, \xc2\xa7127.820, and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s safeguards require physicians to keep and submit to inspection detailed records of their actions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7127.855, 127.865.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though regulation of health and safety is \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily, and historically, a matter of local concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hillsborough County</em> v. <em>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/index.html">471 U. S. 707</a>, 719 (1985), there is no question that the Federal Government can set uniform national standards in these areas.  See <em>Raich, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6).  In connection to the CSA, however, we find only one area in which Congress set general, uniform standards of medical practice.  Title I of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, of which the CSA was Title II, provides that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[The Secretary], after consultation with the Attorney General and with national organizations representative of persons with knowledge and experience in the treatment of narcotic addicts, shall determine the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts, and shall report thereon from time to time to the Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74, 84 Stat. 1241, codified at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7290bb\xe2\x80\x932a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis provision strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit language in the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s silence on the practice of medicine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the medical profession it is difficult to defend the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that the statute impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide.  This difficulty is compounded by the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the limited objects of the CSA.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to meet this challenge rests, for the most part, on the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that every Schedule II drug be dispensed pursuant to a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten prescription of a practitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7829(a).  A prescription, the Government argues, necessarily implies that the substance is being made available to a patient for a legitimate medical purpose.  The statute, in this view, requires an anterior judgment about the term \xe2\x80\x9cmedical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government contends ordinary usage of these words ineluctably refers to a healing or curative art, which by these terms cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s death.  It also points to the teachings of Hippocrates, the positions of prominent medical organizations, the Federal Government, and the judgment of the 49 States that have not legalized physician-assisted suicide as further support for the proposition that the practice is not legitimate medicine.  See Brief for Petitioners 22\xe2\x80\x9324; Memorandum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General, App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a\xe2\x80\x93130a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its own, this understanding of medicine\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries is at least reasonable.  The primary problem with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, however, is its assumption that the CSA impliedly authorizes an Executive officer to bar a use simply because it may be inconsistent with one reasonable understanding of medical practice.  Viewed alone, the prescription requirement may support such an understanding, but statutes \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U. S. 561</a>, 570 (1995).  The CSA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions and their arrangement undermine this as-\nsertion of an expansive federal authority to regulate\nmedicine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory criteria for deciding what substances are controlled, determinations which are central to the Act, consistently connect the undefined term \xe2\x80\x9cdrug abuse\xe2\x80\x9d with addiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system.  When the Attorney General schedules drugs, he must consider a substance\xe2\x80\x99s psychic or physiological dependence liability.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7811(c)(7).  To classify a substance in Schedules II through V, the Attorney General must find abuse of the drug leads to psychological or physical dependence.  \xc2\xa7812(b).  Indeed, the differentiation of Schedules II through V turns in large part on a substance\xe2\x80\x99s habit-forming potential: The more addictive a substance, the stricter the controls.  <em>Ibid</em>.  When Congress wanted to extend the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation to substances not obviously habit forming or psychotropic, moreover, it relied not on Executive ingenuity, but rather on specific legislation.  See \xc2\xa71902(a) of the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851 (placing anabolic steroids in Schedule III).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory scheme with which the CSA is intertwined further confirms a more limited understanding of the prescription requirement.  When the Secretary considers FDA approval of a substance with \xe2\x80\x9cstimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect,\xe2\x80\x9d he must forward the information to the Attorney General for possible scheduling.  Shedding light on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of drug abuse, this requirement appears under the heading \xe2\x80\x9cAbuse potential.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7811(f).  Similarly, when Congress prepared to implement the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it did so through the CSA.  \xc2\xa7801a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Interpretive Rule rests on a reading of the prescription requirement that is persuasive only to the extent one scrutinizes the provision without the illumination of the rest of the statute.  See <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Morash,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/107/index.html">490 U. S. 107</a>, 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (1989).  Viewed in its context, the prescription requirement is better understood as a provision that ensures patients use controlled substances under the supervision of a doctor so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse.  As a corollary, the provision also bars doctors from peddling to patients who crave the drugs for those prohibited uses.  See <em>Moore,</em> 423 U. S., at 135, 143.  To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as constituting \xe2\x80\x9cdrug abuse\xe2\x80\x9d under the CSA is discordant with the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s consistent use throughout the statute, not to mention its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA, and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers.  Just as the conventions of expression indicate that Congress is unlikely to alter a statute\xe2\x80\x99s obvious scope and division of authority through muffled hints, the background principles of our federal system also belie the notion that Congress would use such an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States\xe2\x80\x99 police power.  It is unnecessary even to consider the application of clear statement requirements, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bass,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/index.html">404 U. S. 336</a>, 349 (1971); cf. <em>BFP</em> v. <em>Resolution Trust Corporation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/531/index.html">511 U. S. 531</a>, 544\xe2\x80\x93546 (1994), or presumptions against pre-emption, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moran,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/index.html">536 U. S. 355</a>, 387 (2002), to reach this commonsense conclusion.  For all these reasons, we conclude the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s prescription requirement does not authorize the Attorney General to bar dispensing controlled substances for assisted suicide in the face of a state medical regime permitting such conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, in the end, maintains that the prescription requirement delegates to a single Executive officer the power to effect a radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal Government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality.  The text and structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have this far-reaching intent to alter the federal-state balance and the congressional role in maintaining it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961982">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n546 U.

This question-begging conclusion is obscured by a flurry of arguments that distort the statute and disregard settled principles of our interpretive jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, this case involves not one but <em>three</em> independently sufficient grounds for reversing the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  First, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 (2005) (hereinafter Regulation) is clearly valid, given the substantial deference we must accord it under <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461 (1997), and his two remaining conclusions follow naturally from this interpretation.  See Part I, <em>infra</em>.  Second, even if this interpretation of the Regulation is entitled to lesser deference or no deference at all, it is by far the most natural interpretation of the Regulation\xe2\x80\x94whose validity is not challenged here.  This interpretation is thus correct even upon <em>de novo</em> review.  See Part II, <em>infra</em>.  Third, even if that interpretation of the Regulation were incorrect, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s independent interpretation of the <em>statutory</em> phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d in 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7824(a) and 823(f), and his implicit interpretation of the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7823(f)(5), are entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984), and they are valid under <em>Chevron</em>.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Interpretive Rule issued by the Attorney General (hereinafter Directive) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reasons set forth in the OLC Opinion, I hereby determine that assisting suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x98legitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 (2001), and that prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA.  Such conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances may \xe2\x80\x98render his registration \xe2\x80\xa6 inconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x99 and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. [\xc2\xa7]824(a)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Directive thus purports to do three distinct things: (1) to interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in the Regulation to exclude physician-assisted suicide; (2) to determine that prescribing, dispensing, and administering federally controlled substances to assist suicide violates the CSA; and (3) to determine that participating in physician-assisted suicide may render a practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s registration \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(f) and 824(a)(4) (which incorporates \xc2\xa7823(f) by reference).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suffers from an unremitting failure to distinguish among these distinct propositions in the Directive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the validity of the Regulation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7829 to require a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is not at issue.  Respondents conceded the validity of this interpretation in the lower court, see <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 368 F.\xc2\xa03d 1118, 1133 (CA9 2004), and they have not challenged it here.  By its assertion that the Regulation merely restates the statutory standard of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7830(b)(3)(A)(ii), see <em>ante</em>, at 10, the Court likewise accepts that the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation for prescriptions is proper.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 11 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory phrase\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is beyond dispute, then, that a \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7829 must issue for a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Regulation was promulgated by the Attorney General, and because the Directive purported to interpret the language of the Regulation, see 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, this case calls for the straightforward application of our rule that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own regulations is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court reasons that <em>Auer</em> is inapplicable because the Regulation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cSimply put,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court asserts, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, it is doubtful that any such exception to the <em>Auer</em> rule exists.  The Court cites no authority for it, because there is none.  To the contrary, our unanimous decision in <em>Auer</em> makes clear that broadly drawn regulations are entitled to no less respect than narrow ones.  \xe2\x80\x9cA rule requiring the Secretary to construe his own regulations narrowly would make little sense, <em>since he is free to write the regulations as broadly as he wishes, subject only to the limits imposed by the statute</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 463 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if there were an antiparroting canon, however, it would have no application here.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04 (2005) as a regulation that merely \xe2\x80\x9cparaphrase[s] the statutory language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, is demonstrably false.  In relevant part, the Regulation interprets the word \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7829, which governs the dispensation of controlled substances other than those on Schedule I (which may not be dispensed at all).  Entitled \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rescriptions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7829 requires, with certain exceptions not relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe written prescription of a practitioner\xe2\x80\x9d (usually a medical doctor) for the dispensation of Schedule II substances (\xc2\xa7829(a)), \xe2\x80\x9ca written or oral prescription\xe2\x80\x9d for substances on Schedules III and IV (\xc2\xa7829(b)), and no prescription but merely a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d for the dispensation of Schedule V substances (\xc2\xa7829(c)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As used in this section, \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d is susceptible of at least three reasonable interpretations.  First, it might mean any oral or written direction of a practitioner for the dispensation of drugs.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/122/index.html">423 U. S. 122</a>, 137, n.\xc2\xa013 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9cOn its face \xc2\xa7829 addresses only the form that a prescription must take\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [Section] 829 by its terms does not limit the authority of a practitioner\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, in light of the requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9cmedical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d for the dispensation of Schedule V substances, see \xc2\xa7829(c), it might mean a practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s oral or written direction for the dispensation of drugs that the practitioner believes to be for a legitimate medical purpose.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1954 (2d ed. 1950) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] written direction for the preparation and use of a <em>medicine</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 1527 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny substance or preparation used in <em>treating disease</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphases added).  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d might refer to a practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s direction for the dispensation of drugs that serves an <em>objectively </em>legitimate medical purpose, regardless of the practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>subjective</em> judgment about the legitimacy of the anticipated use.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Regulation at issue constricts or clarifies the statute by adopting the last and narrowest of these three possible interpretations of the undefined statutory term: \xe2\x80\x9cA prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04(a) (2005).  We have previously <em>acknowledged </em>that the Regulation gives added content to the text of the statute: \xe2\x80\x9cThe medical purpose requirement explicit in subsection (c) [of \xc2\xa7829] could be implicit in subsections (a) and (b).  Regulation \xc2\xa7[1]306.04 makes it explicit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moore</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 137, n.\xc2\xa013.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court points out that the Regulation adopts some of the phrasing employed in unrelated sections of the statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  This is irrelevant.  A regulation that significantly clarifies the meaning of an otherwise ambiguous statutory provision is not a \xe2\x80\x9cparroting\xe2\x80\x9d regulation, <em>regardless</em> of the sources that the agency draws upon for the clarification.  Moreover, most of the statutory phrases that the Court cites as appearing in the Regulation, see <em>ibid.</em> (citing 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7812(b) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98currently accepted medical use\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), 829(c) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98medical purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), 802(21) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the course of professional practice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d)), are inapposite because they do <em>not</em> \xe2\x80\x9cparrot\xe2\x80\x9d the <em>only</em> phrase in the Regulation that the Directive purported to construe.  See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (\xe2\x80\x9cI hereby determine that assisting suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x98legitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of 21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  None of them includes the key word \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate,\xe2\x80\x9d which gives the most direct support to the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s theory that \xc2\xa7829(c) presupposes a uniform federal standard of medical practice.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the Regulation does not run afowl (so to speak) of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s newly invented prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cparroting\xe2\x80\x9d; and since the Directive represents the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own interpretation of that concededly valid regulation; the only question remaining is whether that interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\xe2\x80\x9d; otherwise, it is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is not a difficult question.  The Directive is assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d to require a medical purpose that is \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of <em>federal</em> law\xe2\x80\x94since that is an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d that we ourselves have adopted.  <em>Webb</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/249/96/index.html">249 U. S. 96</a> (1919), was a prosecution under the Harrison Act of a doctor who wrote prescriptions of morphine \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of providing the user with morphine sufficient to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 99.  The dispositive issue in the case was whether such authorizations were \xe2\x80\x9cprescriptions\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72(b) of the Harrison Act, predecessor to the CSA.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We held that \xe2\x80\x9cto call such an order for the use of morphine a physician\xe2\x80\x99s prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  Like the Directive, this interprets \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d to require medical purpose that is legitimate as a matter of federal law.  And the Directive is also assuredly valid insofar as it interprets \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of federal law to exclude physician-assisted suicide, because that is not only a permissible but indeed the most natural interpretation of that phrase.  See Part II, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Regulation merely parroted the statute, and the Directive therefore had to be treated as though it construed the statute directly, see ante</em>, at 11, the Directive would still be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  The Court does not take issue with the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s contention that no alleged procedural defect, such as the absence of notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgation of the Directive, renders <em>Chevron</em> inapplicable here.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 4 (citing <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Walton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/212/index.html">535 U. S. 212</a>, 219\xe2\x80\x93222 (2002); 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(3)(A) (exempting interpretive rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking)).  Instead, the Court holds that the Attorney General lacks interpretive authority to issue the Directive at all, on the ground that the explicit delegation provision, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7821 (Supp. 2005), limits his rulemaking authority to \xe2\x80\x9cregistration and control,\xe2\x80\x9d which (according to the Court) are not implicated by the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the prescription requirement.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Setting aside the implicit delegation inherent in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the undefined term \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7829, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7821 is manifestly erroneous. The Court urges, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, that \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d is a term defined in part A of the subchapter (entitled \xe2\x80\x9cIntroductory Provisions\xe2\x80\x9d) to mean \xe2\x80\x9cto add a drug or other substance \xe2\x80\xa6 to a schedule <em>under part B of this subchapter</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(5) (emphasis added).  But \xc2\xa7821 is not included in \xe2\x80\x9cpart B of this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d which is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAuthority to Control; Standards and Schedules,\xe2\x80\x9d and consists of the sections related to <em>scheduling</em>, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811\xe2\x80\x93814 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), where the statutory definition is uniquely appropriate.  Rather, \xc2\xa7821 is found in <em>part C</em> of the subchapter, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x93830, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cRegistration of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dispensers of Controlled Substances,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes all and only the provisions relating to the \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7821.  The artificial definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7802(5) has no conceivable application to the use of that word in \xc2\xa7821.  Under that definition, \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d must take a <em>substance</em> as its direct object, see 21 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cproceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 to <em>control </em>a drug or other substance\xe2\x80\x9d), 811(c) (\xe2\x80\x9ceach drug or other substance proposed to be <em>controlled</em> or removed from the schedules\xe2\x80\x9d), 811(d)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf <em>control</em> is required \xe2\x80\xa6 the Attorney General shall issue an order <em>controlling</em> such drug \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d), 812(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cExcept where <em>control</em> is required \xe2\x80\xa6 a drug or other substance may not be placed in any schedule \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  In \xc2\xa7821, by contrast, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d has as its object, not \xe2\x80\x9ca drug or other substance,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather the <em>processes</em> of \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  It could not be clearer that the artificial definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7802(5) is inapplicable.  It makes no sense to speak of \xe2\x80\x9cadding the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of substances to a schedule.\xe2\x80\x9d  We do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense.  What is obviously intended in \xc2\xa7821 is the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o exercise restraining or directing influence over; to dominate; regulate; hence, to hold from action; to curb,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 580.  \xe2\x80\x9cControl\xe2\x80\x9d is regularly used in this ordinary sense elsewhere in <em>part C</em> of the subchapter.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(a)(1), (b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1), (h)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance of effective <em>controls</em> against diversion\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(a)(5), (d)(5) (\xe2\x80\x9cestablishment of effective <em>control</em> against diversion\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7823(g)(2)(H)(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cto exercise supervision or <em>control</em> over the practice of medicine\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7830(b)(1)(C) (\xe2\x80\x9ca listed chemical under the <em>control</em> of the regulated person\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7830(c)(2)(D) (\xe2\x80\x9cchemical <em>control</em> laws\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphases added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the word is given its ordinary meaning, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the prescription requirement of \xc2\xa7829 plainly \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to the \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>control</em> of the \xe2\x80\xa6 dispensing of controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7821 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added), since a prescription is the chief requirement for \xe2\x80\x9cdispensing\xe2\x80\x9d such drugs, see \xc2\xa7829.  The same meaning is compelled by the fact that \xc2\xa7821 is the first section not of part B of the subchapter, which deals entirely with \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in the artificial sense, but of part C, every section of which relates to the \xe2\x80\x9cregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7821.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7822 (persons required to register), 823 (registration requirements), 824 (denial, revocation, or suspension of registration), 825 (labeling and packaging), 826 (production quotas for controlled substances), 827 (recordkeeping and reporting requirements of registrants), 828 (order forms), 829 (prescription requirements), 830 (regulation of listed chemicals and certain machines).  It would be peculiar for the first section of this part to authorize rulemaking for matters covered by the <em>previous </em>part.  The only sensible interpretation of \xc2\xa7821 is that it gives the Attorney General interpretive authority over the provisions of part C, all of which \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to the registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  These provisions include <em>both</em> the prescription requirement of \xc2\xa7829, and the criteria for registration and deregistration of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823 and 824 (as relevant below, see Part III, <em>infra</em>).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is a perfectly valid agency interpretation of its own regulation; and if not that, a perfectly valid agency interpretation of the statute.  No one contends that the construction is \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/325/410/index.html">325 U. S. 410</a>, 414 (1945), or beyond the scope of ambiguity in the statute, see <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 843.  In fact, as explained below, the Directive provides <em>the most natural</em> interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute.  The Directive thus definitively establishes that a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s order authorizing the dispensation of a Schedule II substance for the purpose of assisting a suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7829.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Once this conclusion is established, the other two conclusions in the Directive follow inevitably.  Under our reasoning in <em>Moore</em>, writing prescriptions that are illegitimate under \xc2\xa7829 is certainly not \xe2\x80\x9cin the [usual] course of professional practice\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7802(21) and thus not \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7841(a).  See 423 U. S., at 138, 140\xe2\x80\x93141.  A doctor who does this may thus be prosecuted under \xc2\xa7841(a), and so it follows that such conduct \xe2\x80\x9cviolates the Controlled Substances Act,\xe2\x80\x9d 66 Fed. Reg. 56608.  And since such conduct is thus not in \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with applicable \xe2\x80\xa6 Federal \xe2\x80\xa6 laws relating to controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f)(4), and may also be fairly judged to \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten the public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7823(f)(5), it follows that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch conduct by a physician registered to dispense controlled substances <em>may</em> \xe2\x80\x98render his registration \xe2\x80\xa6 inconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x99 and therefore subject to <em>possible</em> suspension or revocation under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. [\xc2\xa7]824(a)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphases added).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Directive were entitled to no deference whatever, the most reasonable interpretation of the Regulation and of the statute would produce the same result.  Virtually every relevant source of authoritative meaning confirms that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] does not include intentionally assisting suicide.  \xe2\x80\x9cMedicine\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he science and art dealing with the prevention, cure, or alleviation of disease.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 1527.  The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d connotes an <em>objective</em> standard of \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine,\xe2\x80\x9d and our presumption that the CSA creates a uniform federal law regulating the dispensation of controlled substances, see <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</em> v. <em>Holyfield</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/30/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/30/index.html">490 U. S. 30</a>, 43 (1989), means that this objective standard must be a federal one.  As recounted in detail in the memorandum for the Attorney General that is attached as an appendix to the Directive (OLC Memo), virtually every medical authority from Hippocrates to the current American Medical Association (AMA) confirms that assisting suicide has seldom or never been viewed as a form of \xe2\x80\x9cprevention, cure, or alleviation of disease,\xe2\x80\x9d and (even more so) that assisting suicide is not a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d branch of that \xe2\x80\x9cscience and art.\xe2\x80\x9d  See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a\xe2\x80\x93130a.  Indeed, the AMA has determined that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]hysician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician\xe2\x80\x99s role as a healer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 731 (1997).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he overwhelming weight of authority in judicial decisions, the past and present policies of nearly all of the States and of the Federal Government, and the clear, firm and unequivocal views of the leading associations within the American medical and nursing professions, establish that assisting in suicide \xe2\x80\xa6 is not a legitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  OLC Memo, <em>supra</em>, at 129a.  See also <em>Glucksberg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 710, n. 8 (prohibitions or condemnations of assisted suicide in 50 jurisdictions, including 47 States, the District of Columbia, and 2 Territories).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of this \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming weight of authority,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s admission that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n its own, this understanding of medicine\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries is <em>at least reasonable</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 26 (emphasis added), tests the limits of understatement.  The only explanation for such a distortion is that the Court confuses the <em>normative</em> inquiry of what the boundaries of medicine <em>should be</em>\xe2\x80\x94which it is laudably hesitant to undertake\xe2\x80\x94with the <em>objective</em> inquiry of what the accepted definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine\xe2\x80\x9d <em>is</em>.  The same confusion is reflected in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he primary problem with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\xa6 is its assumption that the CSA impliedly authorizes an Executive officer to bar a use simply because it may be inconsistent with <em>one reasonable understanding</em> of medical practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The fact that many in Oregon believe that the boundaries of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medicine\xe2\x80\x9d <em>should be</em> extended to include assisted suicide does not change the fact that the overwhelming weight of authority (including the 47 States that condemn physician-assisted suicide) confirms that they have not yet been so extended.  Not even those of our Eighth Amendment cases most generous in discerning an \xe2\x80\x9cevolution\xe2\x80\x9d of national standards would have found, on this record, that the concept of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medicine\xe2\x80\x9d has evolved so far.  See <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 564\xe2\x80\x93567 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d <em>cannot</em> be read to establish a broad, uniform federal standard for the medically proper use of controlled substances.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  But it also rejects the most plausible alternative proposition, urged by the State, that any use authorized under state law constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  (The Court is perhaps leery of embracing this position because the State candidly admitted at oral argument that, on its view, a State could exempt from the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage the use of morphine to achieve euphoria.)  Instead, the Court reverse-engineers an approach somewhere between a uniform national standard and a state-by-state approach, holding (with no basis in the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s text) that \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d refers to <em>all</em> uses of drugs unrelated to \xe2\x80\x9caddiction and recreational abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  Thus, though the Court pays lipservice to state autonomy, see <em>ante</em>, 23\xe2\x80\x9324, its standard for \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is in fact a hazily defined <em>federal</em> standard based on its purposive reading of the CSA, and extracted from obliquely relevant sections of the Act.  In particular, relying on its observation that the criteria for scheduling controlled substances are primarily concerned with \xe2\x80\x9caddiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (citing 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811(c)(7), 812(b), 811(f), 801a), the Court concludes that the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s prescription requirement must be interpreted in light of this narrow view of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming, however, that the <em>principal</em> concern of the CSA is the curtailment of \xe2\x80\x9caddiction and recreational abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no reason to think that this is its <em>exclusive</em> concern.  We have repeatedly observed that Congress often passes statutes that sweep more broadly than the main problem they were designed to address.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79 (1998).  See also <em>H.\xc2\xa0J. Inc.</em> v. <em>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/229/index.html">492 U. S. 229</a>, 248 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The scheduling provisions of the CSA on which the Court relies confirm that the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdesign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23, is not as narrow as the Court asserts.  In making scheduling determinations, the Attorney General must not only consider a drug\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpsychic or physiological dependence liability\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court points out, <em>ante</em>, at 26 (citing 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7811(c)(7)), but must also consider such broad factors as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7811(c)(3), and (most notably) \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat, if any, risk there is to the public health,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7811(c)(6).  If the latter factor were limited to addiction-related health risks, as the Court supposes, it would be redundant of \xc2\xa7811(c)(7).  Moreover, in making registration determinations regarding manufacturers and distributors, the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d consider \xe2\x80\x9csuch <em>other</em> factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(a)(6), (b)(5), (d)(6), (e)(5) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94over and above the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cdiversion\xe2\x80\x9d of controlled substances, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(1), (d)(1), (d)(5), (e)(1).  And, most relevant of all, in registering and deregistering <em>physicians</em>, the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cmay deny an application for such registration if he determines that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7823(f); see also \xc2\xa7824(a)(4), and in making that determination \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d consider \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7823(f)(5).  <em>All</em> of these provisions, not just those selectively cited by the Court, shed light upon the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to the undefined term \xe2\x80\x9cabuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(5); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7812(b)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3)(A), (b)(4)(A), (b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By disregarding all these public-interest, public-health, and public-safety objectives, and limiting the CSA to \xe2\x80\x9caddiction and recreational abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court rules out the prohibition of anabolic-steroid use for bodybuilding purposes.  It seeks to avoid this consequence by invoking the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  But the only effect of that legislation is to make anabolic steroids controlled drugs under Schedule III of the CSA.  If the only <em>basis</em> for control is (as the Court says) \xe2\x80\x9caddiction and recreational abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d dispensation of these drugs for bodybuilding could not be proscribed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although, as I have described, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion no more defers to state law than does the Directive, the Court relies on two provisions for the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States\xe2\x80\x99 police powers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x94namely the registration provisions of \xc2\xa7823(f) and the nonpre-emption provision of \xc2\xa7903.  Reliance on the former is particularly unfortunate, because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis recounts how Congress amended \xc2\xa7823(f) in 1984 in order to <em>liberate</em> the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s power over registration from the control of state regulators.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14; 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f); see also Brief for Petitioners 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  And the nonpre-emption clause is embarrassingly inapplicable, since it merely disclaims field pre-emption, and affirmatively <em>prescribes </em>federal pre-emption whenever state law creates a conflict.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In any event, the Directive does not purport to pre-empt state law in any way, not even by conflict pre-emption\xe2\x80\x94unless the Court is under the misimpression that some States <em>require </em>assisted suicide.  The Directive merely interprets the CSA to prohibit, like countless other federal criminal provisions, conduct that happens not to be forbidden under state law (or at least the law of the State of Oregon).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s registration provisions, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(f), 824(a), the Court argues that the statute cannot fairly be read to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hide elephants in mouseholes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by delegating to the Attorney General the power to determine the legitimacy of medical practices in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vague terms or ancillary provisions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20 (quoting <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001)).  This case bears not the remotest resemblance to <em>Whitman, </em>which held that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 does not alter <em>the fundamental details</em> of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s power to issue regulations against questionable uses of controlled substances in no way alters \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental details\xe2\x80\x9d of the CSA.  I am aware of only four areas in which the Department of Justice has exercised that power to regulate uses of controlled substances <em>unrelated</em> to \xe2\x80\x9caddiction and recreational abuse\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court apparently understands that phrase: assisted suicide, aggressive pain management therapy, anabolic-steroid use, and cosmetic weight-loss therapy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Harline</em>, 65 Fed. Reg. 5665, 5667 (2000) (weight loss); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Tecca</em>, 62 Fed. Reg. 12842, 12846 (1997) (anabolic steroids); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Roth</em>, 60 Fed. Reg. 62262, 62263, 62267 (1995) (pain management).  There is no indication that enforcement in these areas interferes with the prosecution of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug abuse\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court understands it.  Unlike in <em>Whitman</em>, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s <em>additional</em> power to address other forms of drug \xe2\x80\x9cabuse\xe2\x80\x9d does <em>absolutely nothing</em> to undermine the central features of this regulatory scheme.  Of course it was critical to our analysis in <em>Whitman</em> that the language of the provision did not bear the meaning that respondents sought to give it.  See 531 U. S., at 465.  Here, for the reasons stated above, the provision is most naturally interpreted to incorporate a uniform federal standard for legitimacy of medical practice.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents argue that the Attorney General must defer to state-law judgments about what constitutes legitimate medicine, on the ground that Congress must speak clearly to impose such a uniform federal standard upon the States.  But no line of our clear-statement cases is applicable here.  The canon of avoidance does not apply, since the Directive does not push the outer limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power, compare <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U.

And finally, no clear statement is required on the ground that the Directive intrudes upon an area traditionally reserved exclusively to the States, cf. <em>BFP</em> v. <em>Resolution Trust Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/531/index.html">511 U. S. 531</a>, 544 (1994) (state regulation of titles to real property), because the Federal Government has pervasively regulated the dispensation of drugs for over 100 years.  See generally Brief for Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3\xe2\x80\x9315.  It would be a novel and massive expansion of the clear-statement rule to apply it in a commerce case <em>not involving pre-emption or constitutional avoidance</em>, merely because Congress has chosen to prohibit conduct that a State has made a contrary policy judgment to permit.

S.\xc2\xa0C. [\xc2\xa7]824(a)(4),\xe2\x80\x9d 66 Fed. Reg. 56608, would nevertheless be unassailable in this Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sections 823(f) and 824(a) explicitly grant the Attorney General the authority to register and deregister physicians, and his discretion in exercising that authority is spelled out in very broad terms.  He may refuse to register or deregister if he determines that registration is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f), after considering five factors, the fifth of which is \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7823(f)(5).  See also <em>In re Arora</em>, 60 Fed. Reg. 4447, 4448 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court points out, these broad standards were enacted in the 1984 amendments for the specific purpose of <em>freeing</em> the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion over registration from the decisions of state authorities.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that assisted-suicide prescriptions are issued in violation of \xc2\xa7829 is of course sufficient to support the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that issuing them may be cause for deregistration: such prescriptions would violate the fourth factor of \xc2\xa7823(f), namely \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with applicable \xe2\x80\xa6 Federal \xe2\x80\xa6 laws relating to controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f)(4).  But the Attorney General did not rely solely on subsection (f)(4) in reaching his conclusion that registration would be \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x9d; nothing in the text of the Directive indicates that.  Subsection (f)(5) (\xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d) provides an independent, alternative basis for the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion regarding deregistration\xe2\x80\x94provided that the Attorney General has authority to interpret \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7823(f) to exclude assisted suicide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three considerations make it perfectly clear that the statute confers authority to interpret these phrases upon the Attorney General.  First, the Attorney General is solely and explicitly charged with administering the registration and deregistration provisions.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(f), 824(a).  By making the criteria for such registration and deregistration such obviously ambiguous factors as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress implicitly (but clearly) gave the Attorney General authority to interpret those criteria\xe2\x80\x94<em>whether or not </em>there is any explicit delegation provision in the statute.  \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.  In such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 844.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on the <em>explicit</em> delegation provisions is, at best, a fossil of our pre-<em>Chevron</em> era; at least since <em>Chevron</em>, we have not conditioned our deferral to agency interpretations upon the existence of explicit delegation provisions.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 229 (2001), left this principle of implicit delegation intact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, even if explicit delegation were required, Congress provided it in \xc2\xa7821, which authorizes the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cpromulgate rules and regulations \xe2\x80\xa6 relating to the <em>registration and control</em> of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Because \xe2\x80\x9cdispensing\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the delivery of a controlled substance \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to the lawful order of, a practitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(10), the deregistration of such practitioners for writing impermissible orders \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to the registration \xe2\x80\xa6 of the \xe2\x80\xa6 dispensing\xe2\x80\x9d of controlled substances, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7821 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, \xc2\xa7821 also gives the Attorney General authority to promulgate rules and regulations \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the \xe2\x80\xa6 control of the \xe2\x80\xa6 dispensing of controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  As discussed earlier, it is plain that the <em>ordinary</em> meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d must apply to \xc2\xa7821, so that the plain import of the provision is to grant the Attorney General rulemaking authority over all the provisions of part C of the CSA, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x93830 (main ed. and Supp. 2005).  Registering and deregistering the practitioners who issue the prescriptions necessary for lawful dispensation of controlled substances plainly \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to the \xe2\x80\xa6 control of the \xe2\x80\xa6 dispensing of controlled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7821 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Attorney General is thus authorized to promulgate regulations interpreting \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(f) and 824(a), both by implicit delegation in \xc2\xa7823(f) and by two grounds of explicit delegation in \xc2\xa7821.  The Court nevertheless holds that this triply unambiguous delegation cannot be given full effect because \xe2\x80\x9cthe design of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, evinces the intent to grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services exclusive authority over scientific and medical determinations.  This proposition is not remotely plausible.  The Court cites as authority for the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive authority two specific areas in which his medical determinations are said to be binding on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94with regard to the \xe2\x80\x9cscientific and medical evaluation\xe2\x80\x9d of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s effects that precedes its scheduling, \xc2\xa7811(b), and with regard to \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7290bb\xe2\x80\x932a; see also 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(g) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  See <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  Far from establishing a general principle of Secretary supremacy with regard to all scientific and medical determinations, the fact that Congress granted the Secretary specifically defined authority in the areas of scheduling and addiction treatment, <em>without otherwise mentioning him</em> in the registration provisions, suggests, to the contrary, that Congress envisioned <em>no</em> role for the Secretary in that area\xe2\x80\x94where, as we have said, interpretive authority was both implicitly and explicitly conferred upon the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we could rewrite statutes to accord with sensible \xe2\x80\x9cdesign,\xe2\x80\x9d it is far from a certainty that the Secretary, rather than the Attorney General, ought to control the registration of physicians.  Though registration decisions sometimes require judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices, the Department of Justice has seemingly had no difficulty making them.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Harline</em>, 65 Fed. Reg. 5665; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Tecca, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 12842; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Roth</em>, 60 Fed. Reg. 62262.  But unlike decisions about whether a substance should be scheduled or whether a narcotics addiction treatment is legitimate, registration decisions are not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with \xe2\x80\x9cmedical [and] scientific\xe2\x80\x9d factors.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7823(f).  Rather, the decision to register, or to bring an action to deregister, an individual <em>physician</em> implicates all the policy goals and competing enforcement priorities that attend any exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  It is entirely reasonable to think (as Congress evidently did) that it would be easier for the Attorney General occasionally to make judgments about the legitimacy of medical practices than it would be for the Secretary to get into the business of law enforcement.  It is, in other words, perfectly consistent with an intelligent \xe2\x80\x9cdesign of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d to give the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s chief law enforcement official, not its chief health official, broad discretion over the substantive standards that govern registration and deregistration.  That is <em>especially</em> true where the contested \xe2\x80\x9cscientific and medical\xe2\x80\x9d judgment at issue has to do with the legitimacy of physician-assisted suicide, which ultimately rests, not on \xe2\x80\x9cscience\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine,\xe2\x80\x9d but on a naked value judgment.  It no more depends upon a \xe2\x80\x9cquintessentially medical judgmen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, than does the legitimacy of polygamy or eugenic infanticide.  And it requires no particular <em>medical</em> training to undertake the objective inquiry into how the continuing traditions of Western medicine have consistently treated this subject.  See OLC Memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a\xe2\x80\x93130a.  The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly superior \xe2\x80\x9cmedical expertise\xe2\x80\x9d to make \xe2\x80\x9cmedical judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, is strikingly irrelevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also reasons that, even if the CSA grants the Attorney General authority to interpret \xc2\xa7823(f), the Directive does not purport to exercise that authority, because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not undertake the five-factor analysis\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7823(f) and does not \xe2\x80\x9con its face purport to be an <em>application</em> of the registration provision in \xc2\xa7823(f).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  This reasoning is sophistic.  It would be improper\xe2\x80\x94indeed, <em>impossible</em>\xe2\x80\x94for the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cundertake the five-factor analysis\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7823(f) and to \xe2\x80\x9cappl[y] the registration provision\xe2\x80\x9d outside the context of an actual enforcement proceeding.  But of course the Attorney General may issue regulations to clarify his interpretation of the five factors, and to signal how he will apply them in future enforcement proceedings.  That is what the Directive plainly purports to do by citing \xc2\xa7824(a)(4), and that is why the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion on deregistration is couched in conditional terms: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch conduct by a physician \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>may</em> \xe2\x80\x98render his registration \xe2\x80\xa6 inconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x99 and therefore subject to <em>possible</em> suspension or revocation under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. [\xc2\xa7]824(a)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 56608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows from what we have said that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7823(f) are subject to <em>Chevron</em> deference.  As noted earlier, the Court does not contest that the absence of notice-and-comment procedures for the Directive renders <em>Chevron</em> inapplicable.  And there is no serious argument that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d or that the Directive\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health and safety\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  On the latter point, in fact, the condemnation of assisted suicide by 50 American jurisdictions supports the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s view.  The Attorney General may therefore weigh a physician\xe2\x80\x99s participation in assisted suicide as a factor counseling against his registration, or in favor of deregistration, under \xc2\xa7823(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding to the contrary, the Court merely presents the conclusory assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cit is doubtful the Attorney General could cite the \xe2\x80\x98public interest\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98public health\xe2\x80\x99 to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  But why on earth not?\xe2\x80\x94especially when he has interpreted the relevant statutory factors in advance to give fair warning that such a practice is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to determine the public interest in this area is admittedly broad\xe2\x80\x94but certainly no broader than other congressionally conferred Executive powers that we have upheld in the past.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>National Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/190/index.html">319 U. S. 190</a>, 216\xe2\x80\x93217 (1943) (\xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>New York Central Securities Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/12/index.html">287 U.

The other two conclusions\xe2\x80\x94(2) that prescribing controlled drugs to assist suicide violates the CSA, and (3) that such conduct is also \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the public interest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are inevitable consequences of that first conclusion.  Moreover, the third conclusion, standing alone, is one that the Attorney General is authorized to make.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today is perhaps driven by a feeling that the subject of assisted suicide is none of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s business.  It is easy to sympathize with that position.  The prohibition or deterrence of assisted suicide is certainly not among the enumerated powers conferred on the United States by the Constitution, and it is within the realm of public morality <em>(bonos mores)</em> traditionally addressed by the so-called police power of the States.  But then, neither is prohibiting the recreational use of drugs or discouraging drug addiction among the enumerated powers.  From an early time in our national history, the Federal Government has used its enumerated powers, such as its power to regulate interstate commerce, for the purpose of protecting public morality\xe2\x80\x94for example, by banning the interstate shipment of lottery tickets, or the interstate transport of women for immoral purposes.  See <em>Hoke</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/227/308/index.html">227 U. S. 308</a>, 321\xe2\x80\x93323 (1913); <em>Lottery Case</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/188/321/index.html">188 U. S. 321</a>, 356 (1903).  Unless we are to repudiate a long and well-established principle of our jurisprudence, using the federal commerce power to prevent assisted suicide is unquestionably permissible.  The question before us is not whether Congress <em>can </em>do this, or even whether Congress <em>should </em>do this; but simply whether Congress <em>has </em>done this in the CSA.  I think there is no doubt that it has.  If the term \xe2\x80\x9c<em>legitimate</em> medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d has any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be sure, this acknowledgment did not go far enough, because it overlooked the significance of the word \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is most naturally understood to create an objective, <em>federal</em> standard for appropriate medical uses.  See <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</em> v. <em>Holyfield</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/30/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/30/index.html">490 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 in which the statute uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is in defining the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cvalid prescription\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the reporting requirements that apply to mail orders of regulated substances.  See \xc2\xa7830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  The Regulation did not \xe2\x80\x9cparrot\xe2\x80\x9d this statutory section, because the Regulation was adopted in 1971 and the statutory language was added in 2000.  See Brief for Petitioners 17 (citing the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Act of 2000, \xc2\xa73652, 114 Stat. 1239, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7830(b)(3)).  But even if the statutory language had predated the Regulation, there would be no \xe2\x80\x9cparroting\xe2\x80\x9d of that phrase.  In using the word \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d <em>without</em> definition in the much more critical \xc2\xa7829, Congress left the task of resolving any ambiguity in that word, used in that context, to the relevant Executive officer.  That the officer did so by deeming relevant a technically inapplicable statutory definition contained elsewhere in the statute does not make him a parrot.  He has given to the statutory text a meaning it did not explicitly\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps even not necessarily\xe2\x80\x94contain.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if \xe2\x80\x98control\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7821 were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it would not support the Interpretive Rule.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  That conclusion rests upon a misidentification of the text that the Attorney General, pursuant to his \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d authority, is interpreting.  No one argues that the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7821 gives the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Rather, that word authorizes the Attorney General to interpret (among other things) the \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d requirement of \xc2\xa7829.  The question then becomes whether the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>legitimate medical purpose</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (which all agree is included in \xe2\x80\x9cprescription\xe2\x80\x9d) is at least <em>open</em> to the interpretation announced in the Directive.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq.</em>, to their purely intrastate possession of marijuana for medical use as authorized under California law, a majority of this Court (a mere seven months ago) determined that the CSA effectively invalidated California\xe2\x80\x99s law because \xe2\x80\x9cthe CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, <em>and in what manner</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzales </em>v.<em> Raich, </em>545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 24) (emphasis added).  The majority employed unambiguous language, concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9cmanner\xe2\x80\x9d in which controlled substances can be utilized \xe2\x80\x9cfor medicinal purposes\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the \xe2\x80\x9ccore activities regulated by the CSA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 25).  And, it described the CSA as \xe2\x80\x9ccreating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d including those substances that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98have a useful and legitimate medical purpose,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9cfoster the beneficial use of those medications\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent their misuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em> at ___ (slip op., at 21).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the majority beats a hasty retreat from these conclusions.  Confronted with a regulation that broadly requires all prescriptions to be issued for a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa71306.04(a) (2005), a regulation recognized in <em>Raich </em>as part of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclosed \xe2\x80\xa6 system\xe2\x80\x9d for regulating the \xe2\x80\x9cmanner\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cwhich controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d 545 U.

In other words, in stark contrast to <em>Raich\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>broad conclusions about the scope of the CSA as it pertains to the medicinal use of controlled substances, today this Court concludes that the CSA is merely concerned with fighting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98drug abuse\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and only insofar as that abuse leads to \xe2\x80\x9caddiction or abnormal effects on the nervous system.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Ante, </em>at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s newfound understanding of the CSA as a statute of limited reach is all the more puzzling  because it rests upon constitutional principles that the majority of the Court rejected in <em>Raich</em>.  Notwithstanding the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>545 U. S., at ___, n. 38 (slip op., at 27, n. 38), the <em>Raich </em>majority concluded that the CSA applied to the intrastate possession of marijuana for medicinal purposes authorized by California law because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could have rationally\xe2\x80\x9d concluded that such an application was necessary to the regulation of the \xe2\x80\x9clarger interstate marijuana market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 28, 30).  Here, by contrast, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive interpretation of the CSA is based in no small part on \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure and limitations of federalism, which allow the States \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cgreat latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23 (quoting <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 475 (1996), in turn quoting <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Massachusetts, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/index.html">471 U. S. 724</a>, 756 (1985)).  According to the majority, these \xe2\x80\x9cbackground principles of our federal system \xe2\x80\xa6 belie the notion that Congress would use \xe2\x80\xa6 an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States\xe2\x80\x99 police power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course there is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cobscure\xe2\x80\x9d about the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s grant of authority to the Attorney General.  <em>Ante</em>, p.\xc2\xa0___ (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the CSA prohibits the States from authorizing physician assisted suicide is admittedly \xe2\x80\x9cat least reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 26 (opinion of the Court), and is therefore entitled to deference.  <em>Ante, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  While the scope of the CSA and the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s power thereunder are sweeping, and perhaps troubling, such expansive federal legislation and broad grants of authority to administrative agencies are merely the inevitable and inexorable consequence of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause and separation-of-powers jurisprudence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Raich</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a> (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with limiting the applications of the CSA in a manner consistent with the principles of federalism and our constitutional structure.  <em>Raich</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting); cf. <em>Whitman, supra</em>, at 486\xe2\x80\x93487 (Thomas, J., concurring) (noting constitutional concerns with broad delegations of authority to administrative agencies).  But  that is now water over the dam. The relevance of such considerations was at its zenith in <em>Raich</em>, when we considered whether the CSA could be applied to the intrastate possession of a controlled substance consistent with the limited federal powers enumerated by the Constitution.  Such considerations have little, if any, relevance where, as here, we are merely presented with a question of statutory interpretation, and not the extent of constitutionally permissible federal power.  This is particularly true where, as here, we are interpreting broad, straightforward language within a statutory framework that a majority of this Court has concluded is so comprehensive that it necessarily nullifies the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traditional \xe2\x80\xa6 powers \xe2\x80\xa6 to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Raich</em>, <em>supra, </em>at ___, n. 38 (slip op., at 27, n. 38).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon the constitutional principles that it rejected in <em>Raich</em>\xe2\x80\x94albeit under the guise of statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x94is perplexing to say the least.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority does not expressly address whether the ingestion of a quantity of drugs that is sufficient to cause death has an \xe2\x80\x9cabnormal effec[t] on the nervous system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 25, though it implicitly rejects such a conclusion.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Notably, respondents have not seriously pressed a constitutional claim here, conceding at oral argument that their \xe2\x80\x9cpoint is not necessarily that [the CSA] would be unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.  In any event, to the extent respondents do present a constitutional claim, they do so solely within the framework of <em>Raich</em>.  Framed in this manner, the claim must fail.  The respondents in <em>Raich</em> were \xe2\x80\x9clocal growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana,\xe2\x80\x9d who stood \xe2\x80\x9coutside the interstate drug market\xe2\x80\x9d and possessed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98medicinal marijuana \xe2\x80\xa6 not intended for \xe2\x80\xa6 the stream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  545 U. S., at ___, ___, (slip op., at 5, 16) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Here, by contrast, the respondent-physicians are active participants in the interstate controlled substances market, and the drugs they prescribe for assisting suicide have likely traveled in interstate commerce.  If the respondents in <em>Raich</em> could not sustain a constitutional claim, then <em>a fortiori</em> respondents here cannot sustain one.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 acceptance of <em>Raich</em> forecloses their constitutional challenge.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
