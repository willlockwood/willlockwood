The order denied his petition for leave to proceed with his appeal in forma pauperis from an order of the district court denying his motion to vacate sentence upon a conviction on one count of an indictment for violation of Sec. 2(a) and (b) of the Bank Robbery Act, 12 U.S.C. 588b(a) and (b), 12 U.S.C.A. 558(b)( a, b). </p><p> Petitioner filed, with the district court, notice of appeal from its order and an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which the district court allowed. On the same day petitioner filed his petition for leave to proceed with his appeal in forma pauperis with the circuit court of appeals, which later denied his petition. As the appeal allowed by the district court was already properly before the circuit court of Appeals, it should have allowed petitioner to proceed upon the appeal in forma pauperis, as provided by the district court\'s order. 28 U.S.C. 832, 28 U.
