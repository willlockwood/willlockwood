It further appeared that, on October 11, 1933, the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon consideration of a motion by the petitioner for a stay of mandate pending a petition to this Court for writ of certiorari, stayed its mandate until its further order, and ordered that the petitioner proceed with diligence and promptly file the petition for writ of certiorari in this Court.  Petition for writ of certiorari was filed in this Court on January 6, 1934, and within the time provided by law.</p>\n<p>The solicitor general appeared on behalf of the government upon the rehearing and stated his view to be that this case is controlled by the decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/217/case.html">United States</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 291 U.
