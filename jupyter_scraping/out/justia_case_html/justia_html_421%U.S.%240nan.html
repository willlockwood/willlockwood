JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This litigation was initiated by respondents Wilderness Society, Environmental Defense Fund, Inc., and Friend of the Earth in an attempt to prevent the issuance of permits by the Secretary of the Interior which were required for the construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.  The Court of Appeals awarded attorneys\' fees to respondents against petitioner Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. based upon the court\'s equitable power and the theory that respondents were entitled to fees because they were performing the services of a "private attorney general."  Certiorari was granted, 419 U.S. 823 (1974), to determine whether this award of attorneys\' fees was appropriate.  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A major oil field was discovered in the North Slope of Alaska in 1968. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In June, 1969, the oil companies constituting the consortium owning Alyeska [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] submitted an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 421 U. S. 242</a></p><p> application to the Department of the Interior for rights-of-way for a pipeline that would transport oil from the North Slope across land in Alaska owned by the United States, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] a major part of the transport system which would carry the oil to its ultimate markets in the lower 48 States.  A special interdepartmental task force studied the proposal and reported to the President.  Federal Task Force on Alaskan Oil Development:  A Preliminary Report to the President (1969), in App. 78-89.  An amended application was submitted in December, 1969, which requested a 54-foot right-of-way, along with applications for "special land use permits" asking for additional space alongside the right-of-way and for the construction of a road along one segment of the pipeline. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents brought this suit in March, 1970, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Secretary of the Interior on the grounds that he intended to issue the right-of-way and special land use permits in violation of \xc2\xa7 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 449, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 421 U. S. 243</a></p><p> compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4321 <em>et seq.</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] On the basis of both the Mineral Leasing Act and the NEPA, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction against issuance of the right-of-way and permits.  325 F.Supp. 422 (DC 1970).</p>\n<p>Subsequently the State of Alaska and petitioner Alyeska were allowed to intervene. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  On March 20, 1972, the Interior Department released a six-volume Environmental Impact Statement and a three-volume Economic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 421 U. S. 244</a></p><p> and Security Analysis. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  After a period of time set aside for public comment, the Secretary announced that the requested permits would be granted to Alyeska.  App. 105-138.  Both the Mineral Leasing Act and the NEPA issues were at that point fully briefed and argued before the District Court.  That court then decided to dissolve the preliminary injunction, to deny the permanent injunction, and to dismiss the complaint. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, basing its decision solely on the Mineral Leasing Act.  156 U.S.App.D.C. 121, 479 F.2d 842 (1973) (en banc).  Finding that the NEPA issues were very complex and important, that deciding them was not necessary at that time, since pipeline construction would be enjoined as a result of the violation of the Mineral Leasing Act, that they involved issues of fact still in dispute, and that it was desirable to expedite its decision as much as possible, the Court of Appeals declined to decide the merits of respondents\' NEPA contentions which had been rejected by the District Court. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Certiorari was denied here.  411 U.S. 917 (1973).</p>\n<p>Congress then enacted legislation which amended the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the granting of the permits sought by Alyeska, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and declared that no further action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 421 U. S. 245</a></p><p> under the NEPA was necessary before construction of the pipeline could proceed. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>With the merits of the litigation effectively terminated by this legislation, the Court of Appeals turned to the questions involved in respondents\' request for an award of attorneys\' fees. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  161 U.S.App.D.C. 446, 495 F.2d 1026 (1974) (en banc).  Since there was no applicable statutory authorization for such an award, the court proceeded to consider whether the requested fee award fell within any of the exceptions to the general "American rule" that the prevailing party may not recover attorneys\' fees as costs or otherwise.  The exception for an award against a party who had acted in bad faith was inapposite, since the position taken by the federal and state parties and Alyeska "was manifestly reasonable, and assumed in good faith. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 449, 495 F.2d at 1029.  Application of the "common benefit" exception, which spreads the cost of litigation to those persons benefiting from it, would "stretch it totally outside its basic rationale. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The Court of Appeals nevertheless held that respondents had acted to vindicate "important statutory rights of all citizens . . . ," <em>id.</em> at 452, 495 F.2d at 1032; had ensured that the governmental system functioned properly; and were entitled to attorneys\' fees lest the great cost of litigation of this kind, particularly against well financed defendants such as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 421 U. S. 246</a></p><p> Alyeska, deter private parties desiring to see the laws protecting the environment properly enforced.  Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2412 [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] was thought to bar taxing any attorneys\' fees against the United States, and it was also deemed inappropriate to burden the State of Alaska with any part of the award. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  But Alyeska, the Court of Appeals held, could fairly be required to pay one-half of the full award to which respondents were entitled for having performed the functions of a private attorney general.  Observing that</p>\n<p>"[t]he fee should represent the reasonable value of the services rendered, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances, including, but not limited to, the time and labor required on the case, the benefit to the public, the skill demanded by the novelty or complexity of the issues, and the incentive factor,"</p>\n<p>161 U.S.App.D.C. at 456, 495 F.2d at 1036, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for assessment of the dollar amount of the award. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 421 U. S. 247</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the United States, the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys\' fee from the loser.  We are asked to fashion a far-reaching exception to this "American Rule"; but, having considered its origin and development, we are convinced that it would be inappropriate for the Judiciary, without legislative guidance, to reallocate the burdens of litigation in the manner and to the extent urged by respondents and approved by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>At common law, costs were not allowed; but, for centuries in England, there has been statutory authorization to award costs, including attorneys\' fees.  Although the matter is in the discretion of the court, counsel fees are regularly allowed to the prevailing party. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>During the first years of the federal court system, Congress provided through legislation that the federal courts were to follow the practice with respect to awarding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 421 U. S. 248</a></p><p> attorneys\' fees of the courts of the States in which the federal courts were located, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] with the exception of district courts under admiralty and maritime jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 421 U. S. 249</a></p><p> which were to follow a specific fee schedule. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Those statutes, by 1800, had either expired or been repealed.</p>\n<p>In 1796, this Court appears to have ruled that the Judiciary itself would not create a general rule, independent of any statute, allowing awards of attorneys\' fees in federal courts.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/306/case.html">Arcambel v. Wiseman,</a></span></em> 3 Dall. 306, the inclusion of attorneys\' fees as damages [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] was overturned on the ground that</p>\n<p>"[t]he general practice of the <em>United States</em> is in oposition [<em>sic</em>] to it; and even if that practice </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 421 U. S. 250</a></p><p> were not strictly correct in principle, it is entitled to the respect of the court till it is changed, or modified, by statute."</p>\n<p>This Court has consistently adhered to that early holding.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/54/363/case.html">Day v. Woodworth,</a></span></em> 13 How. 363 (1852); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/82/211/case.html">Oelrichs v.

[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  By legislation in 1842, Congress did give this Court authority to prescribe the items and amounts of costs which could be taxed in federal courts, but the Court took no action under this statutory mandate. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 421 U. S. 251</a></p><p> <em>See</em> S. Law, The Jurisdiction and Powers of the United States Courts 271 n. 1 (1852).</p>\n<p>In 1853, Congress undertook to standardize the costs allowable in federal litigation.  In support of the proposed legislation, it was asserted that there was great diversity in practice among the courts, and that losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor\'s attorney. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The result was a far-reaching </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 421 U. S. 252</a></p><p> Act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts.  One of its purposes was to limit allowances for attorneys\' fees that were to be charged to the losing parties.  Although the Act disclaimed any intention to limit the amount of fees that an attorney and his client might agree upon between themselves, counsel fees collectible from the losing party were expressly limited to the amounts stated in the Act:</p>\n<p>"That, in lieu of the compensation now allowed by law to attorneys, solicitors, and proctors in the United States courts, to United States district attorneys, clerks of the district and circuit courts, marshals, witnesses, jurors, commissioners, and printers, in the several States, the following and no other compensation shall be taxed and allowed.  But this act shall not be construed to prohibit attorneys, solicitors, and proctors from charging to and receiving from their clients, other than the Government, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 421 U. S. 253</a></p><p> such reasonable compensation for their services, in addition to the taxable costs, as may be in accordance with general usage in their respective States, or may be agreed upon between the parties."</p>\n<p>Act of Feb. 26, 1853, 10 Stat. 161.  The Act then proceeds to list specific sums for the services of attorneys, solicitors, and proctors. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>The intention of the Act to control the attorneys\' fees recoverable by the prevailing party from the loser was repeatedly enforced by this Court.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/377/case.html">The Baltimore,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 377 (1869), a $500 allowance for counsel was set aside, the Court reviewing the history of costs in the United States courts and concluding:</p>\n<p>"Fees and costs, allowed to the officers therein named, are now regulated by the act of the 26th of February, 1853, which provides, in its 1st section that, in lieu of the compensation now allowed by law to attorneys, solicitors, proctors, district attorneys, clerks, marshals, witnesses, jurors, commissioners, and printers, the following and no other compensation shall be allowed."</p>\n<p>"Attorneys, solicitors, and proctors may charge their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 421 U.

They may tax a docket fee of twenty dollars on a final hearing in admiralty, if the libellant recovers fifty dollars, but if he recovers less than fifty dollars, the docket fee of the proctor shall be but ten dollars."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 392 (footnotes omitted).  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/82/450/case.html">Flanders v. Tweed,</a></span></em> 15 Wall. 450 (1872), a counsel\'s fee of $6,000 was included by the jury in the damages award.

Attorneys, solicitors, and proctors may charge their clients reasonably for their services, in addition to the taxable costs, but nothing can be taxed or recovered as cost against the opposite party, as an incident to the judgment, for their services except the costs and fees therein described and enumerated.

S. 255</a></p><p> it has not changed the general statutory rule that allowances for counsel fees are limited to the sums specified by the costs statute.  The 1853 Act was carried forward in the Revised Statutes of 1874 [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] and by the Judicial ode of 1911. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Its substance, without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules, was also included in the Revised Code of 1948 as 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1920 [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and 1923(a).

S. 257</a></p><p> be taxed as costs as follows. . . ."  Against this background, this Court understandably declared in 1967 that, with the exception of the small amounts allowed by \xc2\xa7 1923, the rule "has long been that attorney\'s fees are not ordinarily recoverable. . . ."  <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp.,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/714/case.html#717">386 U.

[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Nor has it extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.  What Congress has done, however, while fully recognizing and accepting the general rule, is to make specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys\' fees under selected statutes granting or protecting various federal right. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  These statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 421 U. S. 261</a></p><p> allowances are now available in a variety of circumstances, but they also differ considerably among themselves.  Under the antitrust laws, for instance, allowance of attorneys\' fees to a plaintiff awarded treble damages is mandatory.

Under this scheme of things, it is apparent that the circumstances under which attorneys\' fees are to be awarded and the range of discretion of the courts in making those awards are matters for Congress to determine. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 421 U. S. 263</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is true that, under some, if not most, of the statutes providing for the allowance of reasonable fees, Congress has opted to rely heavily on private enforcement to implement public policy and to allow counsel fees so as to encourage private litigation.  Fee shifting in connection with treble damages awards under the antitrust laws is a prime example; <em>cf. Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html">405 U. S. 251</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html#265">405 U. S. 265</a></span>-266 (1972); and we have noted that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was intended</p>\n<p>"not simply to penalize litigants who deliberately advance arguments they know to be untenable but, more broadly, to encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief under Title II."</p>\n<p><em>Newman, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html#402">390 U. S. 402</a></span> (footnote omitted).  But congressional utilization of the private attorney general concept can in no sense be construed as a grant of authority to the Judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against nonstatutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorneys\' fees whenever the courts deem the public policy furthered by a particular statute important enough to warrant the award.</p>\n<p>Congress itself presumably has the power and judgment to pick and choose among its statutes, and to allow attorneys\' fees under some, but not others.  But it would be difficult, indeed, for the courts, without legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 421 U. S. 264</a></p><p> guidance, to consider some statutes important and others unimportant and to allow attorneys\' fees only in connection with the former.  If the statutory limitation of right-of-way widths involved in this case is a matter of the gravest importance, it would appear that a wide range of statutes would arguably satisfy the criterion of public importance and justify an award of attorneys\' fees to the private litigant.  And, if <em>any</em> statutory policy is deemed so important that its enforcement must be encouraged by awards of attorneys\' fees, how could a court deny attorneys\' fees to private litigants in actions under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 seeking to vindicate <em>constitutional</em> rights?  Moreover, should courts, if they were to embark on the course urged by respondents, opt for awards to the prevailing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, or only to the prevailing plaintiff? [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  Should awards be discretionary or mandatory? [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Would there be a presumption operating for or against them in the ordinary case?  <em>See Newman, supra.</em> [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 421 U. S. 265</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As exemplified by this case itself, it is also evident that the rational application of the private attorney general rule would immediately collide with the express provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="266">Page 421 U. S. 266</a></p><p> of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2412. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  Except as otherwise provided by statute, that section permits costs to be taxed against the United States, "but not including the fees and expenses </p><p><a class="page-number" name="267">Page 421 U. S. 267</a></p><p> of attorneys," in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or official of the United States acting in an official capacity.  If, as respondents argue, one of the main functions of a private attorney general is to call public officials to account and to insist that they enforce the law, it would follow in such cases that attorneys\' fees should be awarded against the Government or the officials themselves.  Indeed, that very claim was asserted in this case. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  But \xc2\xa7 2412, on its face and in light of its legislative history, generally bars such awards, [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] which, if allowable at all, must be expressly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="268">Page 421 U. S. 268</a></p><p> provided for by statute, as, for example, under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000a-3(b). [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="269">Page 421 U. S. 269</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We need labor the matter no further.  It appears to us that the rule suggested here and adopted by the Court of Appeals would make major inroads on a policy matter that Congress has reserved for itself.  Since the approach taken by Congress to this issue has been to carve out specific exceptions to a general rule that federal courts cannot award attorneys\' fees beyond the limits of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1923, those courts are not free to fashion drastic new rules with respect to the allowance of attorneys\' fees to the prevailing party in federal litigation or to pick and choose among plaintiffs and the statutes under which they sue and to award fees in some cases but not in others, depending upon the courts\' assessment of the importance of the public policies involved in particular cases.  Nor should the federal courts purport to adopt on their own initiative a rule awarding attorneys\' fees based on the private attorney general approach when such judicial rule will operate only against private parties, and not against the Government. [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="270">Page 421 U. S. 270</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We do not purport to assess the merits or demerits of the "American Rule" with respect to the allowance of attorneys\' fees.  It has been criticized in recent years, [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>] and courts have been urged to find exceptions to it. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="271">Page 421 U. S. 271</a></p><p> It is also apparent from our national experience that the encouragement of private action to implement public policy has been viewed as desirable in a variety of circumstances.  But the rule followed in our courts with respect to attorneys\' fees has survived.  It is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy, and it is not for us to invade the legislature\'s province by redistributing litigation costs in the manner suggested by respondents and followed by the Court of Appeals.

Cong.Globe, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., 723 (1842) (remarks of Sen. Berrien).  One of its opponents, Senator Buchanan, said the following:</p>\n<p>"If Congress conforms the fee-bills of the courts over which it has control, to the fee-bills of the State courts, that is all that can be expected of it. . . .  But the great and main objection was its transfer of the legislative power of Congress to the Supreme Court."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> the remarks of Senator Bradbury, Cong.Globe App. 32d Cong., 2d Sess., 207 (1853):</p>\n<p>"There is now no uniform rule either for compensating the ministerial officers of the courts or for the regulation of the costs in actions between private suitors.  One system prevails in one district, and a totally different one in another; and in some cases it would be difficult to ascertain that any attention had been paid to any law whatever designed to regulate such proceedings. . . .  It will hence be seen that the compensation of the officers, and the costs taxed in civil suits, is made to depend in a great degree on that allowed in the State courts.  There are no two States where the allowance is the same."</p>\n<p>"When this system was adopted, it had the semblance of equality, which does not now exist.  There were then but sixteen States, in all of which the laws prescribed certain taxable costs to attorneys for the prosecution and defense of suits.  In several of the States which have since been added to the Union, no such cost is allowed, and, in others, the amount is inconsiderable.  As the State fee bills are made so far the rule of compensation in the Federal courts, the Senate will perceive that totally different systems of taxation prevail in the different districts. . . .  It is not only the officers of the courts, but the suitors also, that are affected by the present unequal, extravagant, and often oppressive system."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The abuses that have grown up in the taxation of attorneys\' fees which the losing party has been compelled to pay in civil suits, have been a matter of serious complaint.  The papers before the committee show that, in some cases, those costs have been swelled to an amount exceedingly oppressive to suitors and altogether disproportionate to the magnitude and importance of the causes in which they are taxed or the labor bestowed. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"It is to correct the evils and remedy the defects of the present system that the bill has been prepared and passed by the House of Representatives.

S. 284</a></span>-285, after concluding that the federal courts have equitable power which can be used to create and implement a private attorney general rule, attempts to solve the problems of manageability which such a rule would necessarily raise.  To do so, however, he emasculates the theory.  Instead of a straightforward award of attorneys\' fees to the winning plaintiff who undertakes to enforce statutes embodying important public policies, as the Court of Appeals proposed, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL would tax attorneys\' fees in favor of the private attorney general only when the award could be said to impose the burden on those who benefit from the enforcement of the law.  The theory that he would adopt is not the private attorney general rule, but rather an expanded version of the common fund approach to the awarding of attorneys\' fees.  When Congress has provided for allowance of attorneys\' fees for the private attorney general, it has imposed no such common fund conditions upon the award.  The dissenting opinion not only errs in finding authority in the courts to award attorneys\' fees, without legislative guidance, to those plaintiffs the courts are willing to recognize as private attorneys general, but also disserves that basis for fee-shifting by imposing a limiting condition characteristic of other justifications.</p>\n<p>That condition ill-suits litigation in which the purported benefits accrue to the general public.  In this Court\'s common fund and common benefit decisions, the classes of beneficiaries were small in number, and easily identifiable.  The benefits could be traced with some accuracy, and there was reason for confidence that the costs could indeed be shifted with some exactitude to those benefiting.  In this case, however, sophisticated economic analysis would be required to gauge the extent to which the general public, the supposed beneficiary, as distinguished from selected elements of it, would bear the costs.  The Court of Appeals, very familiar with the litigation and the parties after dealing with the merits of the suit, concluded that "imposing attorneys\' fees on Alyeska will not operate to spread the costs of litigation proportionately among these beneficiaries. . . ."  161 U.S.App.D.C. at 449, 495 F.2d at 1029. MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL would apparently hold that factual assessment clearly wrong.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#288">421 U.

S. 272</a></p><p> on a private attorney general rationale.  Moreover, for the reasons stated by Judge Wright in the Court of Appeals, I would hold that this case was a proper one for the exercise of that power.  As Judge Wright concluded:</p>\n<p>"Acting as private attorneys general, not only have [respondents] ensured the proper functioning of our system of government, but they have advanced and protected in a very concrete manner substantial public interests.  An award of fees would not have unjustly discouraged [petitioner] Alyeska from defending its case in court.  And denying fees might well have deterred [respondents] from undertaking the heavy burden of this litigation."</p>\n<p>161 U.S.App.D.C. 446, 456, 495 F.2d 1026, 1036.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In reversing the award of attorneys\' fees to the respondent environmentalist groups, the Court today disavows the well established power of federal equity courts to award attorneys\' fees when the interests of justice so require.  While, under the traditional American Rule, the courts ordinarily refrain from allowing attorneys\' fees, we have recognized several judicial exceptions to that rule for classes of cases in which equity seemed to favor fee-shifting.  <em>See Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/161/case.html">307 U. S. 161</a></span> (1939); <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html">396 U. S. 375</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#391">396 U. S. 391</a></span>-392 (1970); <em>Hall v.

S. 5</a></span>, 9 (1973).  By imposing an absolute bar on the use of the "private attorney general" rationale as a basis for awarding attorneys\' fees, the Court today takes an extremely narrow view of the independent power of the courts in this area -- a view that flies squarely in the face of our prior cases.</p>\n<p>The Court relies primarily on the docketing fees and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 421 U. S. 273</a></p><p> court costs statute, 28 U.S.C.1923, in concluding that the American Rule is grounded in statute, and that the courts may not award counsel fees unless they determine that Congress so intended.  The various exceptions to the rule against fee-shifting that this Court has created in the past are explained as constructions of the fee statute.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/case.html#257">421 U. S. 257</a></span>.  In addition, the Court notes that Congress has provided for attorneys\' fees in a number of statutes, but made no such provision in others.  It concludes from this selective treatment that, where award of attorneys\' fees is not expressly authorized, the courts should deny them as a matter of course.  Finally, the Court suggests that the policy questions bearing on whether to grant attorneys\' fees in a particular case are not ones that the Judiciary is well equipped to handle, and that fee-shifting under the private attorney general rationale would quickly degenerate into an arbitrary and lawless process.  Because the Court concludes that granting attorneys\' fees to private attorneys general is beyond the equitable power of the federal courts, it does not reach the question whether an award would be proper against Alyeska in this case under the private attorney general rationale.</p>\n<p>On my view of the case, both questions must be answered.  I see no basis in precedent or policy for holding that the courts cannot award attorneys\' fees where the interests of justice require recovery, simply because the claim does not fit comfortably within one of the previously sanctioned judicial exceptions to the American Rule.  The Court has not in the past regarded the award of attorneys\' fees as a matter reserved for the Legislature, and it has certainly not read the docketing fees statute as a general bar to judicial fee shifting.  The Court\'s concern with the difficulty of applying meaningful standards in awarding attorneys\' fees to successful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="274">Page 421 U. S. 274</a></p><p> "public benefit" litigants is a legitimate one, but, in my view, it overstates the novelty of the "private attorney general" theory.  The guidelines developed in closely analogous statutory and nonstatutory attorneys\' fee cases could readily be applied in cases such as the one at bar.  I therefore disagree with the Court\'s flat rejection of the private attorney general rationale for fee-shifting.  Moreover, in my view, the equities in this case support an award of attorneys\' fees against Alyeska.  Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Contrary to the suggestion in the Court\'s opinion, our cases unequivocally establish that granting or withholding attorneys\' fees is not strictly a matter of statutory construction, but has an independent basis in the equitable powers of the courts.  In <em>Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, supra,</em> the lower courts had denied a request for attorneys\' fees from the proceeds of certain bond sales, which, because of petitioners\' success in the litigation, would accrue to the benefit of a number of other similarly situated persons.  This Court reversed, holding that the allowance of attorneys\' fees and costs beyond those included in the ordinary taxable costs recognized by statute was within the traditional equity jurisdiction of the federal courts.  The Court regarded the equitable foundation of the power to allow fees to be beyond serious question:</p>\n<p>"Allowance of such costs in appropriate situations is part of the historic equity jurisdiction of the federal courts."</p>\n<p>307 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/161/case.html#164">307 U.

S. 391</a></span>, we concluded that the District Court was free to determine whether special circumstances would justify an award of attorneys\' fees and litigation costs in excess of the statutory allotment.  Because the petitioners\' lawsuit presumably accrued to the benefit of the corporation and the other shareholders, and because permitting the others to benefit from the petitioners\' efforts without contributing to the costs of the litigation would result in a form of unjust enrichment, the Court held that the petitioners should be given an attorneys\' fee award assessed against the respondent corporation.</p>\n<p>We acknowledged in <em>Mills</em> that the common fund exception to the American Rule had undergone considerable expansion since its earliest applications in cases in which the court simply ordered contribution to the litigation costs from a common fund produced for the benefit of a number of nonparty beneficiaries.  The doctrine could apply, the Court wrote, where there was no fund at all, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#392">396 U.

S. 393</a></span>-394.  As long as the court has jurisdiction over an entity through which the contribution can be effected, it is the fairer course to relieve the plaintiff of exclusive responsibility for the burden.  Finally, we noted that, even where it is impossible to assign monetary value to the benefit conferred,</p>\n<p>"the stress placed by Congress on the importance of fair and informed corporate suffrage leads to the conclusion that, in vindicating the statutory policy, petitioners have rendered a substantial service to the corporation and its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 421 U.

The benefit that we discerned in <em>Mills</em> went beyond simple monetary relief:  it included the benefit to the shareholders of having available to them "an important means of enforcement of the proxy statute."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Only two years ago, in a member\'s suit against his union under the "free speech" provisions of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, we held that it was within the equitable power of the federal courts to grant attorneys\' fees against the union, since the plaintiff had conferred a substantial benefit on all the members of the union by vindicating their free speech interests.  <em>Hall v. Cole,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/1/case.html">412 U. S. 1</a></span> (1973).  Because a court-ordered award of attorneys\' fees in a suit under the free speech provision of the LMRDA promoted Congress\' intention to afford meaningful protection for the rights of employees and the public generally, and because, without provision of attorneys\' fees, an aggrieved union member would be unlikely to be able to finance the necessary litigation, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/1/case.html#13">412 U.

S. 14</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In my view, these cases simply cannot be squared with the majority\'s suggestion that the availability of attorneys\' fees is entirely a matter of statutory authority.  The cases plainly establish an independent basis for equity courts to grant attorneys\' fees under several rather generous rubrics.  The Court acknowledges as much when it says that we have independent authority to award fees in cases of bad faith or as a means of taxing costs to special beneficiaries.  But I am at a loss to understand how it can also say that this independent judicial power succumbs to Procrustean statutory restrictions -- indeed, to statutory silence as soon as the far </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 421 U.

I can only conclude that the Court is willing to tolerate the "equitable" exceptions to its analysis not because they can be squared with it, but because they are by now too well established to be casually dispensed with.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The tension between today\'s opinion and the less rigid treatment of attorneys\' fees in the past is reflected particularly in the Court\'s analysis of the docketing fees statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1923, as a general statutory embodiment of the American Rule.  While the Court has held in the past that Congress can restrict the availability of attorneys\' fees under a particular statute either expressly or by implication, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] <em>see Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/714/case.html">386 U.

In <em>Trustees v. Greenough,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/527/case.html">105 U.

The award of attorneys\' fees beyond the limited ordinary taxable costs, the Court termed costs "as between solicitor and client"; it held that these expenses, which could be assessed to the extent that fairness to the other party would permit, were not subject to the restrictions of the fee statute.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/161/case.html#166">307 U.

Atkinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/527/case.html">369 U. S. 527</a></span> (1962).

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, in <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/714/case.html">386 U. S. 714</a></span> (1967), the Court undertook a comprehensive review of the assessment of attorneys\' fees in federal court actions.  While noting that nonstatutory exceptions to the American Rule had been sanctioned "when overriding considerations of justice seemed to compel such a result," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/714/case.html#718">386 U. S. 718</a></span>, the Court held that the meticulous provision of remedies available under the Lanham Act and the history of unsuccessful attempts to include an attorneys\' fee provision in the Act precluded the Court\'s implying a right to attorneys\' fees in trademark actions.  The Court did not, however, purport to find a statutory basis for the American Rule, and, in fact, it treated \xc2\xa7 1923 as a "general exception" to the American Rule, not its statutory embodiment.  386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/714/case.html#718">386 U. S. 718</a></span> n. 11.</p>\n<p>My Brother WHITE concedes that the language of the 1853 statute indicating that the awards provided therein were exclusive of any other compensation is no longer a part of the fee statute.  But we are told that the fee statute should be read as if that language were still in the Act, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 421 U. S. 281</a></p><p> since there is no indication in the legislative history of the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code that the revisers intended to alter the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1923.  Yet even if that language were still in the Act, I should think that the construction of the Act in the cases creating judicial exceptions to the American Rule would suffice to dispose of the Court\'s argument.  Since that language is no longer a part of the fee statute, it seems even less reasonable to read the fee statute as an uncompromising bar to equitable fee awards.</p>\n<p>Nor can any support fairly be drawn from Congress\' failure to provide expressly for attorneys\' fees in either the National Environmental Policy Act or the Mineral Leasing Act, while it has provided for fee awards under other statutes.  Confronted with the more forceful argument that other sections of the same statute included express provisions for recovery of attorneys\' fees, we twice held that specific remedy provisions in some sections should not be interpreted as evidencing congressional intent to deny the courts the power to award counsel fees in actions brought under other sections of that Act that do not mention attorneys\' fees.  <em>Hall v. Cole,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/1/case.html#11">412 U. S. 11</a></span>; <em>Mills .

Indeed, the <em>Mills</em> Court interpreted congressional silence not as a prohibition, but as authorization for the Court to decide the attorneys fees issue in the exercise of its coordinate, equitable power.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#391">396 U. S. 391</a></span>.  In rejecting the argument from congressional silence in <em>Mills</em> and <em>Hall,</em> the Court relied on the established rule that implied restrictions on the power to do equity are disfavored.  <em>Hecht Co. v. Bowles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/321/case.html">321 U.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court\'s primary contention -- that Congress enjoys hegemony over fee-shifting because of the docketing fee statute and the occasional express provisions for attorneys\' fees -- will not withstand even the most casual reading of the precedents.  The Court\'s recognition of the several judge-made exceptions to the American rule demonstrates the inadequacy of its analysis.  Whatever the Court\'s view of the wisdom of fee-shifting in "public benefit" cases in general, I think that it is a serious misstep for it to abdicate equitable authority in this area in the name of statutory construction.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The statutory analysis aside, the Court points to the difficulties in formulating a "private attorney general" exception that will not swallow the American Rule.  I do not find the problem as vexing as the majority does.  In fact, the guidelines to the proper application of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 421 U. S. 283</a></p><p> private attorney general rationale have been suggested in several of our recent cases, both under statutory attorneys\' fee provisions and under the common benefit exception.</p>\n<p>In <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html">390 U. S. 400</a></span> (1968), we held that successful plaintiffs who sue under the discretionary fee award provision of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are entitled to the recovery of fees "unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust."  390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html#402">390 U. S. 402</a></span>.  The Court reasoned that, if Congress had intended to authorize fees only on the basis of bad faith, no new legislation would have been required in view of the long history of the bad faith exception.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html#402">390 U. S. 402</a></span> n. 4.  The Court\'s decision in <em>Newman</em> stands on the necessity of fee-shifting to permit meaningful private enforcement of protected rights with a significant public impact.  The Court noted that Title II did not provide for a monetary award, but only equitable relief.  Absent a fee-shifting provision, litigants would be required to suffer financial loss in order to vindicate a policy "that Congress considered of the highest priority."  390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html#402">390 U. S. 402</a></span>.  Accordingly, the Court read the attorneys\' fee provision in Title II generously, since, if</p>\n<p>"successful plaintiffs were routinely forced to bear their own attorneys\' fees, few aggrieved parties would be in a position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunctive powers of the federal courts."</p>\n<p>390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/case.html#402">390 U. S. 402</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Analyzing the attorneys\' fee provision in \xc2\xa7 718 of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, the Court in <em>Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/696/case.html">416 U. S. 696</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/696/case.html#718">416 U. S. 718</a></span> (1974), made a similar point.  There, the school board, a publicly funded governmental entity, had been engaged in litigation with parents of schoolchildren in the district.  The Court observed that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 421 U. S. 284</a></p><p> two parties had vastly disparate resources for litigation, and that the plaintiffs had</p>\n<p>"rendered substantial service both to the Board itself, by bringing it into compliance with its constitutional mandate, and to the community at large by securing for it the benefits assumed to flow from a nondiscriminatory educational system."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/696/case.html#718">416 U. S. 718</a></span>.  Although the analysis in <em>Newman</em> was directed at construing the statutory fees provision and the analysis in <em>Bradley</em> went to the question of whether the fees provision should be applied to services rendered before its enactment, the arguments in those cases for reading the attorneys\' fee provisions broadly is quite applicable to nonstatutory cases as well.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we have already recognized several of the same factors in the recent common benefit cases.  In <em>Mills,</em> we emphasized the benefit to the class of shareholders of having a meaningful remedy for corporate misconduct through private enforcement of the proxy regulations.  Since the beneficiaries could fairly be taxed for this benefit, we held that the fee award should be made available.  Similarly, in <em>Hall,</em> we pointed to the imbalance between the litigating power of the union and one of its members:  in order to ensure that the right in question could be enforced, we held that attorneys\' fees should be provided in appropriate cases.  Additionally, we noted that the enforcement of the rights in question would accrue to the special benefit of the other union members, which justified assessing the attorneys\' fees against the treasury of the defendant union.</p>\n<p>From these cases and others, it is possible to discern with some confidence the factors that should guide an equity court in determining whether an award of attorneys\' fees is appropriate. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The reasonable cost of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 421 U. S. 285</a></p><p> plaintiff\'s representation should be placed upon the defendant if (1) the important right being protected is one actually or necessarily shared by the general public or some class thereof; (2) the plaintiff\'s pecuniary interest in the outcome, if any, would not normally justify incurring the cost of counsel; and (3) shifting that cost to the defendant would effectively place it on a class that benefits from the litigation.</p>\n<p>There is hardly room for doubt that the first of these criteria is met in the present case.  Significant public benefit are derived from citizen litigation to vindicate expressions of congressional or constitutional policy.  <em>See Newman v. Pigge Park Enterprises, supra.</em>  As a result of this litigation, respondents forced Congress to revise the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, rather than permit its continued evasion.  <em>See</em> Pub.L. 9153, 87 Stat. 576.  The 1973 amendments impose more stringent safety and liability standards, and they require Alyeska to pay fair market value for the right-of-way and to bear the costs of applying for the permit and monitoring the right-of-way.</p>\n<p>Although the NEPA issues were not actually decided, the lawsuit served as a catalyst to ensure a thorough analysis of the pipeline\'s environmental impact.  Requiring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 421 U. S. 286</a></p><p> the Interior Department to comply with the NEPA and draft an impact statement satisfied the public\'s statutory right to have information about the environmental consequences of the project, 83 Stat. 853, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4332(C), and also forced delay in the construction until safeguards could be included as conditions to the new right-of-way grants. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that these "beneficial results . . . might have occurred" without this litigation.  Brief for Petitioner 11, 342.  But the record demonstrates that Alyeska was unwilling to observe and the Government unwilling to enforce congressional land use policy.  Private action was necessary to assure compliance with the Mineral Leasing Act; the new environmental, technological, and land use safeguards written into the 1973 amendments to the Act are directly traceable to the respondents\' success in this litigation.  In like manner, continued action was needed to prod the Interior Department into filing an impact statement; prior to the litigation, the Department and Alyeska were prepared to proceed with the construction of the pipeline on a piecemeal basis without considering the overall risks to the environment and to the physical integrity of the pipeline.</p>\n<p>The second criterion is equally well satisfied in this case.  Respondents\' willingness to undertake this litigation was largely altruistic.  While they did, of course, stand to benefit from the additional protections they sought for the area potentially affected by the pipeline, <em>see Sierra Club v. Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html">405 U. S. 727</a></span> (1972), the direct benefit to these citizen organizations is truly dwarfed by the demands of litigation of this proportion.  Extensive factual discovery, expert scientific analysis, and legal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 421 U. S. 287</a></p><p> research on a broad range of environmental, technological, and land use issues were required.  <em>See</em> Affidavit of Counsel (Re Bill of Costs), App. 213-219.  The disparity between respondents\' direct stake in the outcome and the resources required to pursue the case is exceeded only by the disparity between their resources and those of their opponents -- the Federal Government and a consortium of giant oil companies.</p>\n<p>Respondents\' claim also fulfills the third criterion, for Alyeska is the proper party to bear and spread the cost of this litigation undertaken in the interest of the general public.  The Department of the Interior, of course, bears legal responsibility for adopting a position later determined to be unlawful.  And, since the class of beneficiaries from the outcome of this litigation is probably coextensive with the class of United States citizens, the Government should in fairness bear the costs of respondents\' representation.  But the Court of Appeals concluded that it could not impose attorneys\' fees on the United States, because in its view the statute providing for assessment of costs against the Government, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2412, permits the award of ordinary court costs, "but [does] not includ[e] the fees and expenses of attorneys."  Since the respondents did not cross-petition on that point, we have no occasion to rule on the correctness of the court\'s construction of that statute. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="288">Page 421 U. S. 288</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The statute, construed in light of the rule against implied restrictions on equity jurisdiction, may not foreclose attorneys\' fee awards against the United States in all cases.  Section 2412 states that the ordinary recoverable costs shall not include attorneys\' fees; it may be read not to bar fee awards, over and above ordinary taxable costs, when equity demands.  In any event, there are plainly circumstances under which \xc2\xa7 2412 would not bar attorneys\' fee awards against the United States, <em>see, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency,</em> 484 F.2d 1331 (CA1 1973).</p>\n<p>Before the Department and the courts, Alyeska advocated adoption of the position taken by Interior, playing a major role in all aspects of the case. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  This litigation conferred direct and concrete economic benefits on Alyeska and its principals in affording protection of the physical integrity of the pipeline.  If a court could be reasonably confident that the ultimate incidence of costs imposed upon an applicant for a public permit would indeed be on the general public, it would be equitable to shift those costs to the applicant. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  In this connection, Alyeska, as a consortium of oil companies that do business in 49 States and account for some 20% of the national oil market, would indeed be able to redistribute the additional cost to the general public.  In my view, the ability to pass the cost forward to the consuming public warrants an award here.  The decision to bypass Congress and avoid analysis of the environmental consequences of the pipeline was made in the first instance by Alyeska\'s principals and not the Secretary of the Interior.  The award does not punish the consortium for these actions but recognizes that it is an effective substitute for the public beneficiaries who successfully challenged these actions.  Since the Court of Appeals held Alyeska accountable for a fair share of the fees to ease the burden on the public-minded citizen litigators, I would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also Kansas City Southern R.

Industrial Lumber Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/116/case.html">417 U. S. 116</a></span> (1974), we held that attorneys\' fees should not be granted as a matter of course under the provision of the Miller Act that granted claimants the right to "sums justly due."  49 Stat. 794, as amended, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 270b(a).  To overturn the American Rule as a matter of statutory construction would be improper, we held, with no better evidence of congressional intent to provide for attorneys\' fees, and, in the context of everyday commercial litigation such as that, under the Miller Act.  417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/116/case.html#130">417 U.

Cole,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/1/case.html#5">412 U. S. 5</a></span>; <em>F. D. Rich Co., Inc. v. United States ex rel.

Indeed, the <em>Vaughan</em> Court itself relied on <em>Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,</em> 186 F.2d 473 (CA4 1951), a nonadmiralty case in which the plaintiff was awarded attorneys\' fees as an equitable matter because of the obduracy of the defendant in opposing the plaintiff\'s civil rights claim.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The words of the <em>Hecht</em> Court apply well to the case at hand:</p>\n<p>"The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.  Flexibility, rather than rigidity, has distinguished it.  The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs, as well as between competing private claims.  We do not believe that such a major departure from that long tradition as is here proposed should be lightly implied."</p>\n<p>321 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/321/case.html#329">321 U. S. 329</a></span>-330.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court makes the further point that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2412 generally precludes a grant of attorneys\' fees against the Federal Government and its officers.  Even if this is true, I fail to see how it supports the view that the private attorney general rationale should be jettisoned altogether.  There are many situations in which other entities, both private and public, are sued in public interest cases.  If attorneys\' fees can properly be imposed on those parties, I see no reason why the statutory immunity of the Federal Government should have any bearing on the matter.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>These teachings have not been lost on the lower courts in which the elements of the private attorney general rationale have been more fully explored.  <em>See e.g., Souza v.

Section 2412 states that the ordinary recoverable costs shall not include attorneys\' fees; it may be read not to bar fee awards, over and above ordinary taxable costs, when equity demands.  In any event, there are plainly circumstances under which \xc2\xa7 2412 would not bar attorneys\' fee awards against the United States, <em>see, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.
