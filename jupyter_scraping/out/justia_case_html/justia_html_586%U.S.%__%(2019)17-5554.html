When Congress amended ACCA two years later, it replaced the enumerated crimes with the elements clause, an expanded enumerated offenses clause, and the now-defunct residual clause.

This  understanding is buttressed by the then widely accepted definitions of robbery among the States, a significant majority of which defined nonaggravated robbery as requiring a degree of force sufficient only to overcome a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.

Petitioner Denard Stokeling was an employee of the restaurant, and the Miami Beach Police identified him as a suspect based on surveillance video from the burglary and witness statements.  After conducting a criminal background check, police learned that Stokeling had previously been convicted of three felonies\xe2\x80\x94home invasion, kidnaping, and robbery.  When confronted, Stokeling admitted that he had a gun in his backpack.  The detectives opened the backpack and discovered a 9-mm semiautomatic firearm, a magazine, and 12 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Stokeling pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  The probation office recommended that Stokeling be sentenced as an armed career criminal under ACCA, which provides that a person who violates \xc2\xa7922(g) and who has three previous convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years.  \xc2\xa7924(e).  ACCA defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d that</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As relevant here, Stokeling objected that his 1997 Florida robbery conviction was not a predicate offense under ACCA.  This conviction, he argued, did not qualify under the first clause\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9celements clause\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because Florida robbery does not have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under Florida law, robbery is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe taking of money or other property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the person or custody of another, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla.

Zollman eds., 9th ed. 1923).  And \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted if sufficient force [was] exerted to overcome the resistance encountered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 861.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A few examples illustrate the point.  Under the common law, it was robbery \xe2\x80\x9cto seize another\xe2\x80\x99s watch or purse, and use sufficient force to break a chain or guard by which it is attached to his person, or to run against another, or rudely push him about, for the purpose of diverting his attention and robbing him.\xe2\x80\x9d W. Clark &amp; W. Marshall, Law of Crimes 554 (H. Lazell ed., 2d ed. 1905) (Clark &amp; Marshall) (footnotes omitted).  Similarly, it was robbery to pull a diamond pin out of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair when doing so tore away hair attached to the pin.  See<i> </i>2 W. Russell, Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 68 (2d ed. 1828).  But the crime was larceny, not robbery, if the thief did not have to overcome such resistance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, common-law authorities frequently used the terms \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably.  See <i>ibid.</i> (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cif any injury be done to the person, or there be any struggle by the party to keep possession of the property before it be taken from him, there will be a sufficient actual \xe2\x80\x98violence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to establish robbery); Clark &amp; Marshall 553 (\xe2\x80\x9cSufficient <i>force</i> must be used to overcome resistance.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If there is any injury to the person of the owner, or if he resists the attempt to rob him, and his resistance is overcome, there is sufficient <i>violence</i> to make the taking robbery, however slight the resistance\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The common law also did not distinguish between gradations of \xe2\x80\x9cviolence.\xe2\x80\x9d  If an act physically overcame a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance, \xe2\x80\x9chowever slight\xe2\x80\x9d that resistance might be, it necessarily constituted violence.  <i>Ibid.</i>; 4 W.

See <i>Samantar</i> v. <i>Yousuf</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, 320, n.\xc2\xa013 (2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\x98is understood to legislate against a background of common-law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. principles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the level of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d needed at common law was by this time well established: \xe2\x80\x9cSufficient force must be used to overcome resistance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. however slight the resistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clark &amp; Marshall 553.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1986, Congress amended the relevant provisions of ACCA to their current form.  The amendment was titled Expansion of Predicate Offenses for Armed Career Criminal Penalties.  See Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \xc2\xa71402,\n\n100Stat.\n3207\xe2\x80\x9339.  This amendment replaced the two enumerated crimes of \xe2\x80\x9crobbery or burglary\xe2\x80\x9d with the current elements clause, a new enumerated-offenses list, and a (now-defunct) residual clause.  See <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  In the new statute, robbery was no longer enumerated as a predicate offense.  But the newly created elements clause extended ACCA to cover <i>any</i> offense that has as an element \xe2\x80\x9cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical <i>force</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (2012 ed.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hall</i> v. <i>Hall</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947)).  That principle supports our interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d here.  By retaining the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1986 version of ACCA and otherwise \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xpan[ding]\xe2\x80\x9d the predicate offenses under ACCA, Congress made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d required for common-law robbery would be sufficient to justify an enhanced sentence under the new elements clause.  We can think of no reason to read \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in the revised statute to require anything more than the degree of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d required in the 1984 statute.  And it would be anomalous to read \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d as <i>excluding</i> the quintessential ACCA-predicate crime of robbery, despite the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s retention of the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d and its stated intent to expand the number of qualifying offenses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The symmetry between the 1984 definition of robbery (requiring the use of \xe2\x80\x9cforce or violence\xe2\x80\x9d) and the 1986 elements clause (requiring the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d) is striking.  By replacing robbery as an enumerated offense with a clause that has \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d as its touchstone, Congress made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d retained the same common-law definition that undergirded the original definition of robbery adopted a mere two years earlier.  That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the original 1984 statute defined \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d using terms with well-established common-law meanings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is further buttressed by the then widely accepted definitions of robbery in the States.  In 1986, a significant majority of the States defined nonaggravated robbery as requiring force that overcomes a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.  The Government counts 43 States that measured force by this degree, 5 States that required \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d to cause bodily injury, and 2 States and the District of Columbia that permitted force to encompass something less, such as purse snatching.  App. B to Brief for United States.  Stokeling counters that, at most, 31 States defined force as overcoming victim resistance.  Reply Brief 21.  We need not declare a winner in this numbers game because, either way, it is clear that many States\xe2\x80\x99 robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates under Stokeling\xe2\x80\x99s reading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">His reading would disqualify more than just basic-robbery statutes.  Departing from the common-law understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d would also exclude other crimes that have as an element the force required to commit basic robbery.  For instance, Florida requires the same element of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d for both armed robbery and basic robbery.  See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7812.13(2)(a) (distinguishing armed robbery from robbery by requiring the additional element of \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ying] a firearm or other deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d during the robbery).  Thus, as Stokeling\xe2\x80\x99s counsel admitted at oral argument, \xe2\x80\x9carmed robbery in Florida\xe2\x80\x9d would not qualify under ACCA if his view were adopted.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\xe2\x80\x934; see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lee</i>, 886 F.\xc2\xa03d 1161, 1163, n. 1 (CA11 2018) (treating \xe2\x80\x9cFlorida strong-arm robbery [<i>i.e., </i>basic robbery], armed robbery, and attempted robbery .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the same for purposes of analyzing the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Where, as here, the applicability of a federal criminal statute requires a state conviction, we have repeatedly declined to construe the statute in a way that would render it inapplicable in many States.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>United States</i> v. <i>Castleman</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, 167 (2014) (reading \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d to include common-law force, in part because a different reading would render\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) \xe2\x80\x9cineffectual in at least 10 States\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Voisine</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9) (declining to interpret \xc2\xa7912(a)(33)(A) in a way that would \xe2\x80\x9crisk rendering \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) broadly inoperative\xe2\x80\x9d in 34 States and the District of Columbia).  That approach is appropriate here as well.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d comports with <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133 (2010).  There, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actua[l] and intentiona[l] touching\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the level of force necessary to commit common-law misdemeanor battery\xe2\x80\x94did not require the \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of force\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause.  <i>Id.</i>, at 138, 140.  To reach this conclusion, the Court parsed the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, it explained that the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cplainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies\xe2\x80\x94distinguishing physical force, from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 138.  The Court then considered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the term \xe2\x80\x98force\xe2\x80\x99 in [the elements clause] has the specialized meaning that it bore in the common-law definition of battery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 139.  After reviewing the context of the statute, the Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d encompassed even the \xe2\x80\x9cslightest offensive touching.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Instead, it held that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c<i>violent</i> force\xe2\x80\x94that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 140.  Applying that standard to a Florida battery law criminalizing \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any </i>intentional physical contact,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded that the law did not require the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of ACCA.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Stokeling argues that <i>Johnson</i> rejected as insufficient the degree of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d required to commit robbery under Florida law because it is not \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial force.\xe2\x80\x9d  We dis-agree.  The nominal contact that <i>Johnson</i> addressed<i> </i>in- volved physical force that is different in kind from the violent<i> </i>force necessary to overcome resistance by a victim.  The force necessary for misdemeanor battery does not require resistance or even physical aversion on the part of the victim; the \xe2\x80\x9cunwanted\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the physical contact itself suffices to render it unlawful.  See <i>State </i>v. <i>Hearns</i>, 961 So.\xc2\xa02d 211, 216 (Fla. 2007).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, the force necessary to overcome a victim\xe2\x80\x99s physical resistance is inherently \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense contemplated by <i>Johnson</i>, and \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[s] a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 139.  This is true because robbery that must overpower a victim\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94even a feeble or weak-willed victim\xe2\x80\x94necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle.  The altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 140.  Indeed, <i>Johnson</i> itself relied on a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d that specifically encompassed robbery: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[f]orce consisting in a physical act, <i>esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim</i>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 139 (quoting Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009); emphasis added).  Robbery thus has always been within the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98category of violent, active crimes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress included in ACCA.  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To get around <i>Johnson</i>, Stokeling cherry picks adjectives from parenthetical definitions in the opinion, insisting that the level of force must be \xe2\x80\x9csevere,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cextreme,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfurious,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cvehement.\xe2\x80\x9d  These adjectives cannot bear the weight Stokeling would place on them.  They merely supported <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s actual holding: that common-law battery does not require \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  <i>Johnson </i>did not purport to establish a force threshold so high as to exclude even robbery from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Moreover, Stokeling ignores that the Court also defined \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>unjust or improper </i>force.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  As explained above, the common law similarly linked the terms \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Overcoming a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance was <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i> violence against the victim, even if it ultimately caused minimal pain or injury.  See Russell, Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors, at 68.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the wake of <i>Johnson</i>,<i> </i>the Court has repeated its holding<i> </i>that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sessions</i> v. <i>Dimaya</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320) (quoting <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 140); see also <i>Castleman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 173\xe2\x80\x93174 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finding this definition difficult to square with his position, Stokeling urges us to adopt a new, heightened reading of physical force: force that is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably expected to cause pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  For the reasons already explained, that definition is inconsistent with the degree of force necessary to commit robbery at common law.  Moreover, the Court declined to adopt that standard in <i>Johnson</i>,<i> </i>even after considering similar language employed in a nearby statutory provision,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143. <i> </i>The Court instead settled on \xe2\x80\x9cforce <i>capable</i> of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 140 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cCapable\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chaving attributes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. required for performance or accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chaving traits conducive to or features permitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 203 (1983); see also Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus 180 (2d ed. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9chaving the ability or quality necessary to do\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Johnson </i>thus does not require any particular degree of likelihood or probability that the force used will cause physical pain or injury; only potentiality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Stokeling\xe2\x80\x99s proposed standard would also prove exceedingly difficult to apply.  Evaluating the statistical probability that harm will befall a victim is not an administrable standard under our categorical approach.  Crimes can be committed in many different ways, and it would be difficult to assess whether a crime is categorically likely to harm the victim, especially when the statute at issue lacks fine-tuned gradations of \xe2\x80\x9cforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  We decline to impose yet another indeterminable line-drawing exercise on the lower courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Stokeling next contends that <i>Castleman </i>held that minor uses of force do not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cviolent force,\xe2\x80\x9d but he misreads that opinion.  In <i>Castleman</i>, the Court noted that for purposes of a statute focused on domestic-violence misdemeanors, crimes involving relatively \xe2\x80\x9cminor uses of force\xe2\x80\x9d that might not \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute \xe2\x80\x98violence\xe2\x80\x99 in the generic sense\xe2\x80\x9d could nevertheless qualify as predicate offenses.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 165.  The Court thus had no need to decide more generally whether, under <i>Johnson</i>, conduct that leads to relatively minor forms of injury\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9ca cut, abrasion, [or] bruise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnecessitate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the use of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent force.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 170.  Only Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion addressed that question, and he concluded that force as small as \xe2\x80\x9chitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, and hair pulling,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 182 (alterations omitted), satisfied <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  He reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]one of those actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive touching, and all of them are capable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 182.  This understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with our holding today that force is \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of causing physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of <i>Johnson </i>when it is sufficient to overcome a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.  Such force satisfies ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now apply these principles to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s robbery statute to determine whether it \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As explained, Florida law defines robbery as \xe2\x80\x9cthe taking of money or other property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the person or custody of another, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7812.13(1).  The Florida Supreme Court has made clear that this statute requires \xe2\x80\x9cresistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Robinson </i>v. <i>State</i>, 692 So.\xc2\xa02d 883, 886 (1997).  Mere \xe2\x80\x9csnatching of property from another\xe2\x80\x9d will not suffice.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Several cases cited by the parties illustrate the application of the standard articulated in <i>Robinson</i>.  For example, a defendant who grabs the victim\xe2\x80\x99s fingers and peels them back to steal money commits robbery in Florida.  <i>Sanders </i>v. <i>State</i>, 769 So.\xc2\xa02d 506, 507\xe2\x80\x93508 (Fla. App. 2000).  But a defendant who merely snatches money from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s hand and runs away has not committed robbery.  <i>Goldsmith </i>v. <i>State</i>, 573 So.\xc2\xa02d 445 (Fla. App. 1991).  Similarly, a defendant who steals a gold chain does not use \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98force,\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of the robbery statute,\xe2\x80\x9d simply because the victim \xe2\x80\x9cfe[els] his fingers on the back of her neck.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Walker </i>v. <i>State</i>, 546 So.\xc2\xa02d 1165, 1166\xe2\x80\x931167 (Fla. App. 1989).  It is worth noting that, in 1999, Florida enacted a separate \xe2\x80\x9csudden snatching\xe2\x80\x9d statute that proscribes this latter category of conduct; under that statute, it is unnecessary to show either that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cused any amount of force beyond that effort necessary to obtain possession of the money or other property\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was any resistance by the victim to the offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7812.131 (1999).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the application of the categorical approach to the Florida robbery statute is straightforward.  Because the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in ACCA encompasses the degree of force necessary to commit common-law robbery, and because Florida robbery requires that same degree of \xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d Florida robbery qualifies as an ACCA-predicate offense under the elements clause.  Cf. <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254, 261 (2013) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the relevant statute has the same elemen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthen the prior conviction can serve as an ACCA predicate\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140, includes the amount of force necessary to overcome a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.  Robbery under Florida law corresponds to that level of force and therefore qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause.

To arrive at that answer, the Court was required to interpret what exactly Congress meant when it used the words \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d to define the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d that should be captured by the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause.

Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWe think it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x98<i>violent </i>felony,\xe2\x80\x99 the phrase \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99 means <i>violent </i>force\xe2\x80\x94that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  See <i>Flores </i>v. <i>Ashcroft, </i>350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easterbrook, J.). Even by itself, the word \xe2\x80\x98violent\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2846 (defining \xe2\x80\x98violent\xe2\x80\x99 as \xe2\x80\x98[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement . . . \xe2\x80\x99); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x98[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength\xe2\x80\x99); Black\xe2\x80\x99s [Law Dictionary] 1706 [(9th ed. 2009)] (\xe2\x80\x98[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force\xe2\x80\x99).  When the adjective \xe2\x80\x98violent\xe2\x80\x99 is attached to the noun \xe2\x80\x98felony,\xe2\x80\x99 its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer.  See <i>id., </i>at 1188 (defining \xe2\x80\x98violent felony\xe2\x80\x99 as \xe2\x80\x98[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\xe2\x80\x99); see also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Doe, </i>960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C.

It is clear in context that the Court in <i>Johnson </i>did not mean the word \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d in the way that the majority uses it today, because <i>Johnson </i>rejected an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d that would have included a crime of battery that could be satisfied by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most \xe2\x80\x98nominal contact,\xe2\x80\x99 such as a \xe2\x80\x98ta[p] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the shoulder without consent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138.  As any first-year torts student (or person with a shoulder injury) quickly learns, even a tap on the shoulder is \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of causing physical pain or injury\xe2\x80\x9d in certain cases.  So the Court could not have meant \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cpotentiality\xe2\x80\x9d sense that the majority, see <i>ante</i>, at 11, ascribes to it.  Rather, it meant it in the sense that its entire text indicates: \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial degree of force\xe2\x80\x9d can cause physical pain or injury.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140.<i> </i>The phrase denoted, that is, a heightened degree of force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida robbery, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, cannot meet <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s definition of physical force. <i> </i>As noted above, Florida robbery requires \xe2\x80\x9cforce sufficient to overcome a victim\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Robinson</i>, 692 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 887.  But that can mean essentially no force at all.  See <i>McCloud</i> v. <i>State</i>, 335 So.\xc2\xa02d 257, 258 (Fla. 1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny degree of force suffices to convert larceny into a robbery\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Montsdoca</i>, 84 Fla., at 86, 93 So., at 159 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe degree of force used is immaterial\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, the force element of Florida robbery is satisfied by a pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm.  See <i>Robinson</i>, 692 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 887, n.\xc2\xa010 (citing <i>Colby</i> v. <i>State</i>, 46 Fla. 112, 113, 35 So. 189, 190 (1903)).  Florida courts have held the same for a thief who pulls cash from a victim\xe2\x80\x99s hand by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98peel[ing] [his] fingers back,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that [the victim] did not put up greater resistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sanders</i> v. <i>State</i>, 769 So. 2d 506, 507 (Fla. App. 2000).  The Government concedes, similarly, that a thief who grabs a bag from a victim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder also commits Florida robbery, so long as the victim instinctively holds on to the bag\xe2\x80\x99s strap for a moment.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\xe2\x80\x9334; see also <i>Benitez-Saldana </i>v. <i>State</i>, 67 So. 3d 320, 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (Fla. App. 2011).  And Stokeling points to at least one person who was convicted of Florida robbery after causing a bill to rip while pulling cash from a victim\xe2\x80\x99s hand.  See App. B to Brief for Petitioner.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While these acts can, of course, be accomplished with more than minimal force, they need not be.  The thief who loosens an already loose grasp or (assuming the angle is right) tears the side of a $5 bill has hardly used any force at all.  Nor does the thief who simply pulls his arm free from a store employee\xe2\x80\x99s weak grasp or snatches a handbag onto which a victim fleetingly holds use \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that <i>Johnson</i> meant the phrase, because he does not use \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial degree of force\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstrong physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Johnson</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140.

The least culpable conduct proscribed by Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7812.13 does not entail \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as this Court properly construed that phrase in <i>Johnson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The purpose underlying the ACCA confirms that a robbery statute that sweeps as broadly as Florida\xe2\x80\x99s does not qualify as an ACCA predicate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As noted above, the ACCA prescribes a 15-year  mandatory-minimum prison term for anyone convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm so long as that person has three qualifying past convictions.  In <i>Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (2008), this Court explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender\xe2\x80\x94a violent criminal or drug trafficker\xe2\x80\x94possesses a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 146.  The ACCA, that is to say, does not look to past crimes simply to get a sense of whether a particular defendant is generally a recidivist; rather, it looks to past crimes to determine specifically \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Begay </i>considered whether a New Mexico felony conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) qualified as an ACCA predicate under the now-defunct residual clause.  See <i>id.,</i> at 141\xe2\x80\x93142.  Felony DUI, the Court explained, did not fit with the types of crimes that Congress was trying to capture, because while it \xe2\x80\x9creveal[ed] a degree of callousness toward risk,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not \xe2\x80\x9cshow an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 146.  The Court had \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same is true here.  The lower grade offenders whom Florida still chooses to call \xe2\x80\x9crobbers\xe2\x80\x9d do not bear the hallmarks of being the kind of people who are likely to point a gun and pull the trigger, nor have they committed the more aggravated conduct\xe2\x80\x94pointing a weapon, inflicting bodily injury\xe2\x80\x94that most people think of when they hear the colloquial term \xe2\x80\x9crobbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under Florida law, \xe2\x80\x9crobbers\xe2\x80\x9d can be glorified pickpockets, shoplifters, and purse snatchers.  No one disputes that such an offender, if later discovered illegally in possession of a firearm, will in many cases merit greater punishment as a result of the past offense; unless it occurred far in the past, such a conviction will typically increase that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s advisory sentencing range under the U.\xc2\xa0S. Sentencing Guidelines.  See <i>Rosales-Mireles</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 585 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2018) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x93(7), 4A1.1, 4A1.2(e) (Nov. 2018).  But there is \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term\xe2\x80\x9d for such offenders, who do not present the increased risk of gun violence that more aggravated offenders present.  See <i>Begay</i>,<i> </i>553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Unable to rely heavily on text, precedent, or purpose to support its holding that Florida robbery qualifies as an ACCA \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority turns to the common law, to legislative and statutory history, and finally to what it perceives as the consequences of ruling for Stokeling.  None of these rationales is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority observes that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s statute requires no less force than was necessary to commit common-law robbery.  That may well be true: The majority notes, for example, that at common law \xe2\x80\x9cit was robbery to pull a diamond pin out of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair when doing so tore away hair attached to the pin,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 4, and as anyone who has ever pulled a bobby pin out of her hair knows, hair can break from even the most minimal force.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s telling, however, the ACCA itself \xe2\x80\x9cencompasses the degree of force necessary to commit common-law robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13.  That proposition is flatly inconsistent with <i>Johnson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In explaining its interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court in <i>Johnson</i> expressly rejected the common law\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d see 559 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 139, instead recognizing that the phrase should be \xe2\x80\x9cgive[n]\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. its ordinary meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 138.  At common law, \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d could be \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 139.  But as the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (citation omitted).  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9ccontext determines meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, and, \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x98<i>violent </i>felony,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the ordinary rather than the  common-law meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d was what fit, <i>id.,</i> at 140.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority now says that while <i>Johnson</i> rejected the common-law meaning of force with regard to battery, it nevertheless meant somehow to preserve the common-law meaning of force with regard to robbery.  See <i>ante</i>, at<i> </i>4\xe2\x80\x936, 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  In other words, to reach its conclusion, the majority must construe \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to bear two different meanings\xe2\x80\x94<i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94depending on the crime to which it is being applied.  That is a radical and unsupportable step.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be clear, the majority does not simply rule that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d carries the common-law meaning in one place but a different meaning in another statutory provision.  There would certainly be precedent for that.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Castleman</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, 162\xe2\x80\x93168 (2014) (explaining why the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d took on a common-law meaning, rather than its ACCA meaning under <i>Johnson</i>, in the context of a statute defining a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Johnson</i>, in fact, expressly reserved the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d might mean something different in the context of a different statutory definition.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143\xe2\x80\x93144.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What <i>Johnson </i>did not do, however, was suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in a single clause\xe2\x80\x94the elements clause\xe2\x80\x94that <i>Johnson</i> addressed might mean two different things for two different crimes.  See <i>id.,</i> at 143 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99 only in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x98violent felony\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>id.,</i> at 138\xe2\x80\x93142.  <i>Johnson</i> had good reason not to say so: because that is not how we have said that statutory interpretation works.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Martinez</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371, 378 (2005) (observing that a single statutory word or phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccannot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be interpreted to do\xe2\x80\x9d two different things \xe2\x80\x9cat the same time\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Ratzlaf</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 135, 143 (1994) (similar).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Starting today, however, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) will apparently lead a Janus-faced existence.  When it comes to battery, that phrase will look toward ordinary meaning; when it comes to robbery, that same piece of statutory text will look toward the common law.  To the extent that is a tenable construction, the majority has announced a brave new world of textual interpretation.  To the extent that a phrase so divided cannot stand, meanwhile, one could be forgiven for thinking that the majority, though it claims to praise <i>Johnson</i>, comes instead to bury it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To shore up its argument that the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d at least in the context of robbery, takes on the common-law meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority invokes the history of the ACCA.  Statutory history is no help to the majority here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the majority notes, a precursor to the ACCA prescribed a mandatory-minimum sentence for people convicted of firearm offenses who had three qualifying prior convictions \xe2\x80\x9cfor robbery or burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71202(a) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  That statute defined robbery, as relevant, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe taking of the property of another .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by force or violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71202(c)(8) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  See <i>ante</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In other words, it is undisputed that at one point, in a previous statute, Congress enumerated robbery as a qualifying predicate and used the words \xe2\x80\x9cforce or violence\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a generic version of the crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Then, in 1986, Congress changed the statute, substituting instead the language we know today.

Gone was any explicit reference to \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d; in its place came not only the elements clause (our focus here) but also the enumerated clause (which retained an express reference to \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d but omitted \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d) and the capacious residual clause (struck down in 2015).

So Congress did two salient things: It expanded the predicates in general, and it deleted an express reference to robbery.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority reasons that because (1) the old law\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d as a taking involving \xe2\x80\x9cforce or violence\xe2\x80\x9d matched various common-law definitions of robbery, (2) Congress kept the word \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d (though not \xe2\x80\x9cor violence\xe2\x80\x9d) in the new law\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause while deleting the word \xe2\x80\x9crobbery,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) Congress meant to expand the enhancement\xe2\x80\x99s reach in a general sense, Congress must have meant for the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in the new law also to carry the common-law meaning of robbery.  See <i>ante</i>, at<i> </i>4\xe2\x80\x937.  The conclusion that the majority draws from these premises does not follow, for at least four reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, as already discussed, the question whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in the new law\xe2\x80\x94that is, in the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause\xe2\x80\x94carries the  common-law meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d was already asked and an- swered by <i>Johnson</i>: It does not.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138\xe2\x80\x93143, 145; <i>supra,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  This part of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument may be couched in statutory history, but it is no more than an attempt to relitigate <i>Johnson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Congress deleted the word \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d from the statute altogether while still enumerating robbery\xe2\x80\x99s former neighbor, \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d in the enumerated clause.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2, 11.  When Congress keeps one piece of statutory text while deleting another, we generally \xe2\x80\x9chave no trouble concluding that\xe2\x80\x9d it does so with purpose, see, <i>e.g., Director of Revenue of Mo.</i> v. <i>CoBank ACB</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316, 324 (2001), absent some reason to believe that the missing term simply got \xe2\x80\x9clost in the shuffle,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wilson</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 329, 336 (1992).  See also, <i>e.g., Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere Congress includes limiting language in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was not intended\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, it is inconceivable that Congress simply lost track of robbery, one of only two generic crimes that it enumerated in the old statute.  Accordingly, if Congress had wanted to retain the old statute\xe2\x80\x99s specific emphasis on robbery, the natural reading is that it would have accomplished that goal the same way it did with burglary: by making it an enumer- ated offense.  That it did not do so is telling.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the fact that Congress wished to \xe2\x80\x9cexpan[d] the predicate offenses triggering the sentence enhancement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 582, is entirely consistent with paring back the statute\xe2\x80\x99s sweep with regard to robbery specifically.  I may wish to expand the contents of my refrigerator,  but that does not mean that I will buy more of every single item that is currently in it the next time that I go shopping.  Here, the ACCA\xe2\x80\x94with its (new, generalized) elements clause, its (augmented) enumerated clause, and (until recently) its highly capacious residual clause\xe2\x80\x94undeniably expanded the precursor statute\xe2\x80\x99s bare enumeration of robbery and burglary, regardless of how many robbery statutes qualify as predicates specifically under the elements clause.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, even assuming that Congress wanted robbery to remain largely encompassed by the ACCA despite deleting the word from the precursor statute, that intent is fully consistent with properly applying <i>Johnson</i> here.  The majority, by focusing on the elements clause, ignores the residual clause, which\xe2\x80\x94until it was declared unconstitutional in 2015\xe2\x80\x94provided a home for many crimes regardless of whether they included an element of violent \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Hewing to a proper reading of <i>Johnson</i>, in other words, does not require assuming that Congress constricted the precursor statute\xe2\x80\x99s application to robbery when it enacted today\xe2\x80\x99s ACCA; whatever robberies would have qualified under the old statute presumably could have still qualified under the residual clause during its nearly 20-year existence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the statutory history does not undermine the conclusion that the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause, under our precedents, is not broad enough to encompass Florida\xe2\x80\x99s robbery statute.  Congress deleted the word \xe2\x80\x9crobbery,\xe2\x80\x9d kept the word \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d supplemented burglary with the catchall residual clause that still captured many robberies outside the elements clause, and used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in the elements clause to define a type of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d which <i>Johnson</i> tells us requires more force than the term\xe2\x80\x99s common-law meaning denotes.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138\xe2\x80\x93143, 145.  Statutory history cannot get the major- ity past both the text and the force of <i>stare decisis</i> here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">That leaves the majority with only the practical consequences that it asserts would follow if this Court were to hold that Florida robbery does not qualify under the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s elements clause.  See <i>ante</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  While looking to how an interpretation of a federal statute would affect the applicability of related state statutes can be a useful approach in these cases, see, <i>e.g., Castleman</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 167, the results that follow from a proper reading of <i>Johnson</i> are not nearly as incongruous as the majority suggests.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To begin, take the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion \xe2\x80\x9cthat many States\xe2\x80\x99 robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 7, if the Court were to apply <i>Johnson</i> as it was written.<i> </i>The accuracy of this statement is far less certain than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion lets on.  While Stokeling and the Government come close to agreeing that at least 31 States\xe2\x80\x99 robbery statutes do have an overcoming-resistance requirement, see <i>ante</i>, at 7,<i> </i>that number is not conclusive because neither Stokeling nor the Government has offered an accounting of how many of those States allow minimal force to satisfy that requirement, as Florida does.  Because robbery laws vary from State to State, and because even similarly worded statutes may be construed differently by different States\xe2\x80\x99 courts, some of those 31 States may well require more force than Florida does.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Doctor</i>, 842 F.\xc2\xa03d 306, 312 (CA4 2016) (ruling that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no indication that South Carolina robbery by violence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a statute cited by the Government here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan be committed with minimal actual force\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Duenas-Alvarez</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183, 193 (2007) (explaining that the categorical approach \xe2\x80\x9crequires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, even if it is true \xe2\x80\x9cthat many States\xe2\x80\x99 robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates\xe2\x80\x9d under a faithful reading of <i>Johnson</i>, see <i>ante</i>, at 7, that outcome would stem just as much (if not more) from the death of the residual clause as from a decision in this case.  As discussed above, various state robbery statutes qualified under that expansive clause for nearly 20 years, until vagueness problems led this Court to strike the clause down as unconstitutional.  See <i>supra,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa02; see also <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  The fall of that clause would therefore be an independent cause of any drop in qualifying predicates, regardless of what this Court decides today.  (A drop in robbery statutes qualifying as ACCA predicates could also, of course, be traceable to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to continue enumerating robbery when it enacted the ACCA in the first place.)  In short, the majority, fearful for the camel, errs in blaming the most recent straw.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Separately, even if a number of simple robbery statutes were to cease qualifying as ACCA predicates, that does not mean\xe2\x80\x94as the majority implies, see <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x94that the same fate necessarily would befall most or even many aggravated robbery statutes.  The majority offers the single example of Florida aggravated robbery, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cFlorida requires the same element of \xe2\x80\x98force\xe2\x80\x99 for both armed robbery and basic robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  But while the majority accurately describes Florida law, there is scant reason to believe that a great many other States\xe2\x80\x99 statutes would be similarly affected, because the effect that hewing to <i>Johnson</i> would have on Florida aggravated robbery stems from the idiosyncrasy that Florida aggravated robbery requires neither displaying a weapon nor threatening or inflicting bodily injury.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The result for Florida aggravated robbery therefore sheds little light on what would happen to other aggravated-robbery statutes, the vast majority of which do (and did at the time of the ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment) appear to provide for convictions on such grounds\xe2\x80\x94and whose validity as ACCA predicates would not necessarily turn on the question the Court faces today.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  The majority mistakes one anomalous result for a reason not to apply <i>Johnson</i> as it was written.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Johnson</i> tells us that when Congress wrote the words \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of a statute targeting \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d it eschewed the common-law meaning of those words and instead required a higher degree of force.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138\xe2\x80\x93143, 145.  <i>Johnson</i> resolves this case.  Florida law requires no more than minimal force to commit Florida robbery, and Florida law therefore defines that crime more broadly than Congress defined the elements clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The crime that most people think of when they think of \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d is a serious one.  That is all the more reason, however, that this Court should not allow a dilution of the term in state law to drive the expansion of a federal statute targeted at violent recidivists.  Florida law applies the label \xe2\x80\x9crobbery\xe2\x80\x9d to crimes that are, at most, a half-notch above garden-variety pickpocketing or shoplifting.  The Court today does no service to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes or our own precedent in deeming such crimes to be \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felonies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thus predicates for a 15-year mandatory-minimum sentence in federal prison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Of course, whether Congress wished to pull back the throttle with regard to robbery across the whole ACCA is less certain.  (Recall that Congress also enacted the capacious residual clause.)  But that is why the statutory history cannot tell us what the majority claims that it can about the elements clause specifically.  Instead, the more reliable guide is the new text that Congress enacted to replace the old.  Cf. <i>West Virginia Univ.
