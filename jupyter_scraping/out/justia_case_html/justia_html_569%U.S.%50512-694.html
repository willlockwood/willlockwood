At his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim previously reported that he had assaulted her but that the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations. The state supreme court held that this evidence was properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional rights.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decade-long romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon.  In 1998, after several previous attempts to end the relationship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North Las Vegas without telling respondent where she was mov- ing.  Respondent learned of Heathmon\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, and on the night of October 21, 1998, he visited her apartment.  What happened next was the focus of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHeathmon told police and later testified that respondent forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.  After raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring from her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment and toward his car by the neck and hair.  A witness confronted the couple, and respondent fled.  Police observed injuries to Heathmon\xe2\x80\x99s neck and scalp that were consis-tent with her account of events, and respondent was eventually arrested.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough respondent did not testify at trial, he discussed Heathmon\xe2\x80\x99s allegations with police shortly after his arrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and \xe2\x80\x9cshe was scared that [he] might do something,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 305, but he claimed that the sex was consensual.  Respondent also admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tShortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would not testify.  She went into hiding, but police eventually found her and took her into custody as a material wit- ness.  Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and agreed to testify.  When asked about the letter at trial, she stated  that three of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s associates had forced her to write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared in court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon had fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to police in an effort to control respondent.  To support that theory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and police reports showing that Heathmon had called the police on several prior occasions claiming that respondent had raped or otherwise assaulted her.  Police were unable to corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in several cases they were skeptical of her claims.  Although the trial court gave the defense wide latitude to cross-examine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as witnesses the officers involved.  The jury found respondent guilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Su- preme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right to present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme Court rejected that argument.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling had violated his right to present a defense.  Applying AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review, the District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.  688 F.\xc2\xa03d 1091 (2012).  The majority held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon\xe2\x80\x99s prior allegations was critical to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s defense, that the exclusion of that evidence violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Id., at 1097\xe2\x80\x931101.  Although it acknowledged that the state court had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact of the State\xe2\x80\x99s rules of evidence on the defense \xe2\x80\x9cwas disproportionate to the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1101\xe2\x80\x931104.  Finding that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at 1104\xe2\x80\x931106, the Ninth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to release respondent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant relief to a prisoner whose state court conviction \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unreasonable application of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  It is settled that a federal habeas court may overturn a state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).  Applying that deferential standard, we conclude that the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was reasonable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants \xe2\x80\x98a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Crane v. Kentucky, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683, \n690 (1986)\n (quoting California v. Trombetta, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479, \n485 (1984)\n), but we have also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Holmes v. South Carolina, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 319, \n324 (2006)\n (quoting United States v. Scheffer, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303, \n308 (1998)\n).  Only rarely have we held that the right to present a complete defense was violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 331 (rule did not rationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock v. Arkansas, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 44, \n61 (1987)\n (rule arbitrary); Chambers v.

But contrary to the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of our clearly established precedents was reasonable.  The starting point in the state court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was a state statute that generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evidence of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\xe2\x80\x99 credibility, other than conviction of crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66; see Nev. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa750.085(3) (2011).  The purpose of that rule, the Nevada Supreme Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis to focus the fact-finder on the most impor- tant facts and conserve \xe2\x80\x98judicial resources by avoiding mini-trials on collateral issues.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Abbott v. State, 122 Nev. 715, 736, 138 P.\xc2\xa03d 462, 476 (2006) (quoting State v. Long, 140 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 27, 30 (Mo. 2004)).  These are \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark v. Arizona, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, \n770 (2006)\n, and the Nevada statute is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that generally precludes the admission of evidence of specific instances of a witness\xe2\x80\x99 conduct to prove the witness\xe2\x80\x99 character for untruthfulness.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence \xc2\xa76.27, pp.\xc2\xa0497\xe2\x80\x93499 (4th ed. 2009).  The constitutional propriety of this rule cannot be seriously disputed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa750.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in Miller v. State, 105 Nev. 497, 499\xe2\x80\x93500, 779 P.\xc2\xa02d 87, 88\xe2\x80\x9389 (1989), that \xe2\x80\x9cin a sexual assault case defense counsel may cross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab- ricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness denies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic evidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by that witness in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66.  But in order to introduce evidence showing that the witness previously made false allegations, the defendant must file written notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.  Miller, supra, at 501, 779 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 90.  Respondent did not file the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault complaints on this basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNo decision of this Court clearly establishes that this notice requirement is unconstitutional.  Nor, contrary to the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F.\xc2\xa0 3d, at 1103\xe2\x80\x931104, do our cases clearly establish that the Constitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests before such a rule can be enforced.  The decision on which the Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145 (1991)\n, is very far afield.  In that case, we reversed a decision holding that the \n \nSixth Amendment categorically prohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape defendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to introduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the complaining witness.  The Court did not even suggest, much less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such a rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs in favor of enforcement.  Instead, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in th[at] case\xe2\x80\x9d and left it for the state courts to address that question in the first instance.  Id., at 153.  No fair-minded jurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the enforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent with the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSome of the evidence that respondent sought to in- troduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re- ported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually assault her, and the state supreme court did not view its Miller decision as applying in such circumstances.  But the state court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa750.085(3).  Rather, the court reasoned that the proffered evidence had little impeachment value because at most it showed simply that the victim\xe2\x80\x99s reports could not be corroborated.  The admission of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness\xe2\x80\x99 conduct to impeach the witness\xe2\x80\x99 credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly prolong the trial.  No decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons in a particular case violates the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,  the Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA decisions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners who were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination of the witnesses against them.  688 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1098\xe2\x80\x931101 (discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Dept., 421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027, 1035\xe2\x80\x931038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yarborough, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 1091, 1098\xe2\x80\x931101 (CA9 2009)).  Those cases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding that various restrictions on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to cross-examine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the \n \nSixth Amendment.  See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227, \n231 (1988)\n (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 673\n\xe2\x80\x93679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, \n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n\xe2\x80\x93316 (1974).  But this Court has never held that the Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to introduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.  See Delaware v. Fensterer, \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15, \n22 (1985)\n (per\xc2\xa0curiam) (observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. expose [testimonial] infirmities through cross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Jordan v. Warden, 675 F.\xc2\xa03d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F.\xc2\xa03d 62, 70 (CA1 2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-examination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the cases as recognizing a broad right to present \xe2\x80\x9cevidence bearing on [a witness\xe2\x80\x99] credibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  688 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1099.  By framing our precedents at such a high level of generality, a lower federal court could transform even the most imaginative extension of existing case law into \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  In thus collapsing the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of federal law\xe2\x80\x9d and what a lower court believes to be \xe2\x80\x9can incorrect or erroneous application of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams v. Taylor, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362, \n412 (2000)\n, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach would defeat the substantial deference that AEDPA requires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.
