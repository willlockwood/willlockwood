[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As we said in Southwestern, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#164">392 U. S. 164</a></span>, CATV\n</em></p>\n<p>"[promises] for the future to provide a national communications system, in which signals from selected broadcasting centers would be transmitted to metropolitan areas throughout the country."</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the Commission has noted,</p>\n<p>"the expanding multi-channel capacity of cable systems could be utilized to provide a variety of new communications services to homes and businesses within a community,"</p>\n<p>such as facsimile reproduction of documents, electronic mail delivery, and information retrieval.  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry, 15 F.C.C.2d 417, 419-420 (1968).  Perhaps more important, CATV systems can themselves originate programs, or "cablecast" -- which means, the Commission has found, that CATV can</p>\n<p>"[increase] the number of local outlets for community self-expression and [augment] the public\'s choice of programs and types of service, without use of broadcast spectrum. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 421. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 406 U.

In particular, the Commission tentatively concluded, as part of a more expansive program for the regulation of CATV, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] "that, for now and in general, CATV program origination is in the public interest," <em>id.</em> at 421, and sought comments on a proposal "to condition the carriage of television broadcast signals (local or distant) upon a requirement that the CATV system also operate to a significant extent as a local outlet by originating."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 406 U. S. 653</a></p><p> <em>Id.</em> at 422.  As for its authority to impose such a requirement, the Commission stated that its</p>\n<p>"concern with CATV carriage of broadcast signals is not just a matter of avoidance of adverse effects, but extends also to requiring CATV affirmatively to further statutory policies."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>On the basis of comments received, the Commission, on October 24, 1969, adopted a rule providing that</p>\n<p>"no CATV system having 3,500 or more subscribers shall carry the signal of any television broadcast station unless the system also operates to a significant extent [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] as a local outlet by cablecasting [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and has available facilities for local production and presentation of programs other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 406 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In a report accompanying this regulation, the Commission stated that the tentative conclusions of its earlier notice of proposed rulemaking</p>\n<p>"recognize the great potential of the cable technology to further the achievement of long-established regulatory goals in the field of television broadcasting by increasing the number of outlets for community self-expression and augmenting the public\'s choice of programs and types of services. . . .  They also reflect our view that a multi-purpose CATV operation combining carriage of broadcast signals with program origination and common carrier services, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] might best exploit cable channel capacity to the advantage of the public and promote the basic purpose for which this Commission was created:"</p>\n<p>"regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 406 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  After full consideration of the comments filed by the parties, we adhere to the view that program origination on CATV is in the public interest.

In requiring, in return for these uses of radio, that CATV devote a portion of the facilities to providing needed origination service, we are furthering our statutory responsibility to \'encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest\' (sec. 303(g)). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The requirement will also facilitate the more effective performance of the Commission\'s duty to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of television service to each of the several States and communities (sec. 307(b)) [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] in areas where we have been unable to accomplish this through broadcast media.

S. 657</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Upon the challenge of respondent Midwest Video Corp., an operator of CATV systems subject to the new cablecasting requirement, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit set aside the regulation on the ground that the Commission "is without authority to impose" it.  441 F.2d 1322, 1328 (1971). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  "The Commission\'s power [over CATV] . . . ," the court explained,</p>\n<p>"must be based on the Commission\'s right to adopt rules that are reasonably ancillary to its responsibilities </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 406 U.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The court\'s opinion may also be understood to hold the regulation invalid as not supported by substantial evidence that it would serve the public interest.  "The Commission report itself shows," the court said,</p>\n<p>"that, upon the basis of the record made, it is highly speculative whether there is sufficient expertise or information available to support a finding that the origination rule will further the public interest."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1328.  "Entering into the program origination field involves very substantial expenditures," <em>id.</em> at 1327, and "[a] high probability exists that cablecasting will not be self-supporting," that there will be a "substantial increase" in CATV subscription fees, and that, "in some instances," CATV operators will be driven out of business.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  We granted certiorari.  404 U.S. 1014 (1972).  We reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 406 U. S. 659</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1966, the Commission promulgated regulations that, in general, required CATV systems (1) to carry, upon request and in a specified order of priority within the limits of their channel capacity, the signals of broadcast stations into whose service area they brought competing signals; (2) to avoid, upon request, the duplication on the same day of local station programing; and (3) to refrain from bringing new distant signals into the 100 largest television markets except upon a prior showing that that service would be consistent with the public interest.  <em>See</em> Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.2d 725 (1966).  In assessing the Commission\'s jurisdiction over CATV against the backdrop of these regulations, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] we focused in <em>Southwestern</em> chiefly on \xc2\xa7 2(a) of the Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152(a), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"The provisions of this [Act] shall apply to all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio . . . which originates and/or is received within the United States, and to all persons engaged within the United States in such communication. . . ."</p>\n<p>In view of the Act\'s definitions of "communication by wire" and "communication by radio," [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] the interstate character of CATV services, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 406 U. S. 660</a></p><p> and the evidence of congressional intent that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Commission was expected to serve as the \'single Government agency\' with \'unified jurisdiction\' and \'regulatory power over all forms of electrical communication, whether by telephone, telegraph, cable, or radio,\'"</p>\n<p>392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#167">392 U. S. 167</a></span>-168 (footnotes omitted), we held that \xc2\xa7 2(a) amply covers CATV systems and operations.  We also held that \xc2\xa7 2(a) is itself a grant of regulatory power, and not merely a prescription of the forms of communication to which the Act\'s other provisions governing common carriers and broadcasters apply:</p>\n<p>"We cannot [we said] construe the Act so restrictively.  Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa7 [2(a)], in the surrounding language, or in the Act\'s history or purposes limits the Commission\'s authority to those activities and forms of communication that are specifically described by the Act\'s other provisions. . . .  Certainly Congress could not, in 1934, have foreseen the development of community antenna television systems, but it seems to us that it was precisely because Congress wished \'to maintain, through appropriate administrative control, a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission,\' <em>F.C.C. v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co.,</em> [309 U.S.] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="661">Page 406 U. S. 661</a></p><p> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/309/134/case.html#138">309 U. S. 138</a></span>, that it conferred upon the Commission a \'unified jurisdiction\' and \'broad authority.\'  Thus,"</p>\n<p>"[u]nderlying the whole [Communications Act] is recognition of the rapidly fluctuating factors characteristic of the evolution of broadcasting and of the corresponding requirement that the administrative process possess sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to these factors."</p>\n<p>"[<em>Ibid.</em>]  Congress, in 1934, acted in a field that was demonstrably \'both new and dynamic,\' and it therefore gave the Commission \'a comprehensive mandate,\' with \'not niggardly, but expansive, powers.\'  <em>National Broadcasting Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/319/190/case.html">319 U. S. 190</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/319/190/case.html#219">319 U. S. 219</a></span>.  We have found no reason to believe that \xc2\xa7 [2] does not, as its terms suggest, confer regulatory authority over \'all interstate . . . communication by wire or radio.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#172">392 U. S. 172</a></span>-173 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>This conclusion, however, did not end the analysis, for \xc2\xa7 2(a) does not, in and of itself, prescribe any objectives for which the Commission\'s regulatory power over CATV might properly be exercised.  We accordingly went on to evaluate the reasons for which the Commission had asserted jurisdiction, and found that</p>\n<p>"the Commission has reasonably concluded that regulatory authority over CATV is imperative if it is to perform with appropriate effectiveness certain of its other responsibilities."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#173">392 U. S. 173</a></span>. In particular, we found that the Commission had reasonably determined that "<em>the unregulated explosive growth of CATV,\'" especially through "its importation of distant signals into the service areas of local stations" and the resulting division of audiences and revenues, threatened to "deprive the public of the various benefits of [the] system of local broadcasting stations" that the Commission was charged with developing and overseeing under \xc2\xa7 307(b) of the </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 406 U.

S. 175</a></span>.  We therefore concluded, without expressing any view "as to the Commission\'s authority, if any, to regulate CATV under any other circumstances or for any other purposes," that the Commission does have jurisdiction over CATV\n</em></p>\n<p>"reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of [its] various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting . . . [and] may, for these purposes, issue \'such rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions, not inconsistent with law,\' as \'public convenience, interest, or necessity requires.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#178">392 U. S. 178</a></span> (quoting \xc2\xa7 303(r) of the Act, 50 Stat. 191, 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 303(r)).  The parties now before us do not dispute that, in light of <em>Southwestern,</em> CATV transmissions are subject to the Commission\'s jurisdiction as "interstate . . . communication by wire or radio" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2(a) even insofar as they are local cablecasts. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The controversy, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 406 U. S. 663</a></p><p> instead, centers on whether the Commission\'s program origination rule is "reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of [its] various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting." [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  We hold that it is. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="664">Page 406 U. S. 664</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the outset, we must note that the Commission\'s legitimate concern in the regulation of CATV is not limited to controlling the competitive impact CATV may have on broadcast services.  Southwestern refers to the Commission\'s "various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting."  These are considerably more numerous than simply assuring that broadcast stations operating in the public interest do not go out of business.  Moreover, we must agree with the Commission that its</p>\n<p>"concern with CATV carriage of broadcast signals is not just a matter of avoidance of adverse effects, but extends also to requiring CATV affirmatively to further statutory policies."</p>\n<p><em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#653">406 U. S. 653</a></span>.  Since the avoidance of adverse effects is itself the furtherance of statutory policies, no sensible distinction, even in theory, can be drawn along those lines.  More important, CATV systems, no less than broadcast stations, <em>see, e.g., Federal Radio Comm\'n v. Nelson Bros. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/266/case.html">289 U. S. 266</a></span> (1933) (deletion of a station), may enhance, as well as impair, the appropriate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 406 U. S. 665</a></p><p> provision of broadcast services.  Consequently, to define the Commission\'s power in terms of the protection, as opposed to the advancement, of broadcasting objectives would artificially constrict the Commission in the achievement of its statutory purposes and be inconsistent with our recognition in <em>Southwestern</em></p>\n<p>"that it was precisely because Congress wished \'to maintain, through appropriate administrative control, a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission\' . . . that it conferred upon the Commission a \'unified jurisdiction\' and \'broad authority.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Supra</em> at 660-661. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The very regulations that formed the backdrop for our decision in <em>Southwestern</em> demonstrate this point.  Those regulations were, of course, avowedly designed to guard broadcast services from being undermined by unregulated CATV growth.  At the same time, the Commission recognized that</p>\n<p>"CATV systems . . . have arisen in response to public need and demand for improved television service, and perform valuable public services in this respect."</p>\n<p>Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.2d 725, 745 (1966). [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  accordingly, the Commission\'s express purpose was not</p>\n<p>"to deprive the public of these important benefits or to restrict the enriched programing selection which \xef\xbf\xbd <a href="#F9" name="T9">9 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">S. 666\xef\xbf\xbd CATV makes available.  Rather, our goal here is to integrate the CATV service into the national television structure in such a way as to promote maximum television service to all people of the United States (Secs. 1 and 303(g) of the act [nn.  </l=|406></a><a href="#F9" name="T9">9 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">| </l=|406></a><a href="#F9" name="T9">9 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">S. 649fn11|&gt;11, <em>supra</em>]), both those who are cable viewers and those dependent on off-the-air service.  The new rules . . . are the minimum measures we believe to be essential to insure that CATV continues to perform its valuable supplementary role without unduly damaging or impeding the growth of television broadcast service."</l=|406></a></p><a href="#F9" name="T9">\n</a><p><a href="#F9" name="T9"><em>Id.</em> at 745-746. [</a><a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  In implementation of this approach, CATV systems were required to carry local broadcast station signals to encourage diversified programing suitable to the community\'s needs, as well as to prevent a diversion of audiences and advertising revenues. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The duplication of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="667">Page 406 U.

Finally, the distant importation rule was adopted to enable the Commission to reach a public interest determination weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed service on the facts of each individual case.  <em>See id.</em> at 776, 781-782.  In short, the regulatory authority asserted by the Commission in 1966 and generally sustained by this Court in Southwestern was authority to regulate CATV with a view not merely to protect, but to promote, the objectives for which the Commission had been assigned jurisdiction over broadcasting.</p>\n<p>In this light, the critical question in this case is whether the Commission has reasonably determined that its origination rule will</p>\n<p>"further the achievement of long-established </p><p><a class="page-number" name="668">Page 406 U.

To be sure, the cablecasts required may be transmitted without use of the broadcast spectrum.  But the regulation is not the less, for that reason, reasonably ancillary to the Commission\'s jurisdiction over broadcast services.  The effect of the regulation, after all, is to assure that, in the retransmission of broadcast signals, viewers are provided suitably diversified programing -- the same objective underlying regulations sustained in <em>National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, supra,</em> as well as the local carriage rule reviewed in <em>Southwestern</em> and subsequently upheld.  <em>See supra</em> at <l=| <a="" href="#F17" name="T17">17 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">S. 666|&gt;666 and nn.  <a href="#F17" name="T17">17 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">| </l=|406></a><a href="#F17" name="T17">17 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">S. 649fn26|&gt;26, <em>supra.</em>  In essence, the regulation is no different from Commission rules governing the technological quality of CATV broadcast carriage.  In the one case, of course, the concern is with the strength of the picture and voice received by the subscriber, while, in the other, it is with the content of the programing offered.  But in both cases, the rules serve the policies of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 303(g) of the Communications Act on which the cablecasting regulation is specifically premised, <em>see supra</em> at 654-656, [</l=|406></a><a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and also, in the Commission\'s words, \xef\xbf\xbd <a href="#F17" name="T17">17 and <l=|406 a="" u<="">S. 670\xef\xbf\xbd</l=|406></a></l=|406></l=|></p><a href="#F17" name="T17">\n<p>"facilitate the more effective performance of [its] duty to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of television service to each of the several States and communities"</p>\n</a><p><a href="#F17" name="T17">under \xc2\xa7 307(b).  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"></span></a><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#656">406 U.

[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  In sum, the regulation preserves and enhances the integrity of broadcast signals, and therefore is "reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission\'s various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting."</p>\n<p>Respondent nevertheless maintains that, just as the Commission is powerless to require the provision of television broadcast services where there are no applicants for station licenses no matter how important or desirable those services may be, so too it cannot require CATV operators unwillingly to engage in cablecasting.  In our view, the analogy respondent thus draws between entry into broadcasting and entry into cablecasting is misconceived.  The Commission is not attempting to compel wire service where there has been no commitment to undertake it.  CATV operators to whom the cablecasting rule applies have voluntarily engaged themselves in providing that service, and the Commission seeks only to ensure that it satisfactorily meets community needs within the context of their undertaking.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that the program origination rule is within the Commission\'s authority recognized in <em>Southwestern.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 406 U. S. 671</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The question remains whether the regulation is supported by substantial evidence that it will promote the public interest.  We read the opinion of the Court of Appeals as holding that substantial evidence to that effect is lacking because the regulation creates the risk that the added burden of cablecasting will result in increased subscription rates and even the termination of CATV services.  That holding is patently incorrect in light of the record.</p>\n<p>In first proposing the cablecasting requirement, the Commission noted that "[t]here may . . . be practical limitations [for compliance] stemming from the size of some CATV systems," and accordingly sought comments</p>\n<p>"as to a reasonable cut-off point [for application of the regulation] in light of the cost of the equipment and personnel minimally necessary for local originations."</p>\n<p>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry, 15 F.C.C.2d 417, 422 (1968).  The comments filed in response to this request included detailed data indicating, for example, that a basic monochrome system for cablecasting could be obtained and operated for less than an annual cost of $21,000. and a color system, for less than $56,000.  <em>See</em> First Report and Order 210.  This information, however, provided only a sampling of the experience of the CATV systems already engaged in program origination.  Consequently, the Commission</p>\n<p>"decided not to prescribe a permanent minimum cut-off point for required origination on the basis of the record now before us.  The Commission intends to obtain more information from originating systems about their experience, equipment, and the nature of the origination effort. . . .  In the meantime, we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 406 U. S. 672</a></p><p> will prescribe a very liberal standard for required origination, with a view toward lowering this floor in . . . further proceedings, should the data obtained in such proceedings establish the appropriateness and desirability of such action."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 213.</p>\n<p>On this basis, the Commission chose to apply the regulation to systems with 3,500 or more subscribers, effective January 1, 1971.</p>\n<p>"This standard [the Commission explained] appears more than reasonable in light of the [data filed], our decision to permit advertising at natural breaks . . . , and the 1-year grace period.  Moreover, it appears that approximately 70 percent of the systems now originating have fewer than 3,500 subscribers; indeed, about half of the systems now originating have fewer than 2,000 subscribers. . . .  [T]he 3,500 standard will encompass only a very small percentage of existing systems at present subscriber levels, less than 10 percent."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  On petitions for reconsideration, the Commission observed that it had</p>\n<p>"been given no data tending to demonstrate that systems with 3,500 subscribers cannot cablecast without impairing their financial stability, raising rates or reducing the quality of service."</p>\n<p>Memorandum Opinion and Order 826.  The Commission repeated that "[t]he rule adopted is minimal in the light of the potentials of cablecasting," [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] but, nonetheless, on its own motion, postponed the effective date of the regulation to April 1, 1971, "to afford additional preparation time."  <em>Id.</em> at 827.</p>\n<p>This was still not the Commission\'s final effort to tailor the regulation to the financial capacity of CATV operators.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 406 U. S. 673</a></p><p> In denying respondent\'s motion for a stay of the effective date of the rule, the Commission reiterated that "there has been no showing made to support the view that compliance . . . would be an unsustainable burden."  Memorandum Opinion and Order, 27 F.C.C.2d 778, 779 (1971).  On the other hand, the Commission recognized that new information suggested that CATV systems of 10,000 ultimate subscribers would operate at a loss for at least four years if required to cablecast.  That information, however, was based on capital expenditure and annual operating cost figures "appreciably higher" than those first projected by the Commission.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Commission concluded:</p>\n<p>"While we do not consider that an adequate showing has been made to justify general change, we see no public benefit in risking injury to CATV systems in providing local origination.  Accordingly, if CATV operators with fewer than 10,000 subscribers request <em>ad hoc</em> waiver of [the regulation], they will not be required to originate pending action on their waiver requests. . . .  Systems of more than 10,000 subscribers may also request waivers, but they will not be excused from compliance unless the Commission grants a requested waiver. . . .  [The] benefit [of cablecasting] to the public would be delayed if the . . . stay [requested by respondent] is granted, and the stay would, therefore, do injury to the public\'s interest."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>This history speaks for itself.  The cablecasting requirement thus applied is plainly supported by substantial evidence that it will promote the public interest. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Indeed, respondent does not appear to argue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 406 U. S. 674</a></p><p> to the contrary.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 434.  It was, of course, beyond the competence of the Court of Appeals itself to assess the relative risks and benefits of cablecasting.  As we said in <em>National Broadcasting Co. v.

The Commission\'s 1968 notice of proposed rulemaking addressed, in addition to the program origination requirement at issue here, whether advertising should be permitted on cablecasts and whether the broadcast doctrines of "equal time," "fairness," and sponsorship identification should apply to them.  Other areas of inquiry included the use of CATV facilities to provide common carrier service; federal licensing and local regulation of CATV; cross-ownership of television stations and CATV systems; reporting and technical standards; and importation of distant signals into major markets.  The notice offered concrete proposals in some of these areas, which were acted on in the Commission\'s First Report and Order, 20 F.C.C.2d 201 (1969) (hereinafter cited as First Report and Order), and Report and Order on Cable Television Service.  <em>See also</em> Memorandum Opinion and Order, 23 F.C.C.2d 825 (1970) (hereinafter cited as Memorandum Opinion and Order).  None of these regulations, aside from the cablecasting requirement, is now before us, <em>see</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>infra</em> and we, of course, intimate no view on their validity.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>"By significant extent [the Commission indicated], we mean something more than the origination of automated services (such as time and weather, news ticker, stock ticker, etc.) and aural services (such as music and announcements).  Since one of the purposes of the origination requirement is to insure that cablecasting equipment will be available for use by others originating on common carrier channels, \'operation to a significant extent as a local outlet,\' in essence, necessitates that the CATV operator have some kind of video cablecasting system for the production of local live and delayed programing (<em>e.g.,</em> a camera and a video tape-recorder, etc.)."</p>\n<p>First Report and Order 214.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>"Cablecasting" was defined as</p>\n<p>"programing distributed on a CATV system which has been originated by the CATV operator or by another entity, exclusive of broadcast signals carried on the system."</p>\n<p>47 CFR \xc2\xa7 74.1101(j).

This conclusion might follow only if the program origination requirement is not reasonably ancillary to the Commission\'s jurisdiction over broadcasting.  For, as we held in <em>Southwestern,</em> CATV operators are, at least to that extent, engaged in a business subject to the Commission\'s regulation.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>This case presents questions of extraordinary difficulty and sensitivity in the communications field, as the opinions of the divided Court of Appeals and our own divisions reflect.  As MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has noted, Congress could not anticipate the advent of CATV when it enacted the regulatory scheme nearly 40 years ago.  Yet that statutory scheme plainly anticipated the need for comprehensive regulation as pervasive as the reach of the instrumentalities of broadcasting.</p>\n<p>In the four decades spanning the life of the Communications Act, the courts have consistently construed the Act as granting pervasive jurisdiction to the Commission to meet the expansion and development of broadcasting.  That approach was broad enough to embrace the advent of CATV, as indicated in the plurality opinion.  CATV is dependent totally on broadcast signals, and is a significant link in the system as a whole, and therefore must be seen as within the jurisdiction of the Act.</p>\n<p>Concededly, the Communications Act did not explicitly contemplate either CATV or the jurisdiction the Commission has now asserted.  However, Congress was well aware in the 1930\'s that broadcasting was a dynamic instrumentality, that its future could not be predicted, that scientific developments would inevitably enlarge the role and scope of broadcasting, and that, in consequence, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 406 U. S. 676</a></p><p> regulatory schemes must be flexible and virtually open-ended.</p>\n<p>Candor requires acknowledgment, for me, at least, that the Commission\'s position strains the outer limits of even the open-ended and pervasive jurisdiction that has evolved by decisions of the Commission and the courts.  The almost explosive development of CATV suggests the need of a comprehensive reexamination of the statutory scheme as it relates to this new development, so that the basic policies are considered by Congress, and not left entirely to the Commission and the courts.</p>\n<p>I agree with the plurality\'s rejection of any meaningful analogy between requiring CATV operators to develop programing and the concept of commandeering someone to engage in broadcasting.  Those who exploit the existing broadcast signals for private commercial surface transmission by CATV -- to which they make no contribution -- are not exactly strangers to the stream of broadcasting.  The essence of the matter is that, when they interrupt the signal and put it to their own use for profit, they take on burdens, one of which is regulation by the Commission.</p>\n<p>I am not fully persuaded that the Commission has made the correct decision in this case, and the thoughtful opinions in the Court of Appeals and the dissenting opinion here reflect some of my reservations.  But the scope of our review is limited, and does not permit me to resolve this issue as perhaps I would were I a member of the Federal Communications Commission.  That I might take a different position as a member of the Commission gives me no license to do so here.  Congress has created its instrumentality to regulate broadcasting, has given it pervasive powers, and the Commission has generations of experience and "feel" for the problem.  I therefore conclude that, until Congress acts, the Commission should be allowed wide latitude, and I therefore concur in the result reached by this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 406 U.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST concur, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The policies reflected in the plurality opinion may be wise ones.  But whether CATV systems should be required to originate programs is a decision that we certainly are not competent to make, and, in my judgment, the Commission is not authorized to make.  Congress is the agency to make the decision, and Congress has not acted.</p>\n<p>CATV captures TV and radio signals, converts the signals, and carries them by microwave relay transmission or by coaxial cables into communities unable to receive the signals directly.  In <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html">392 U. S. 157</a></span>, we upheld the power of the Commission to regulate the transmission of signals.  As we said in that case:</p>\n<p>"CATV systems perform either or both of two functions.  First, they may supplement broadcasting by facilitating satisfactory reception of local stations in adjacent areas in which such reception would not otherwise be possible, and second, they may transmit to subscribers the signals of distant stations entirely beyond the range of local antennae.  As the number and size of CATV systems have increased, their principal function has more frequently become the importation of distant signals."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#163">392 U.

In that case, CATV was sought to be held liable for infringement of copyrights of movies licensed to broadcasters and carried by CATV.  We held CATV not liable, saying:</p>\n<p>"Essentially, a CATV system no more than enhances the viewer\'s capacity to receive the broadcaster\'s signals; it provides a well located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer\'s television set.  It is true that a CATV system plays an \'active\' role in making reception possible in a given area, but so do ordinary television sets and antennas.  CATV equipment is powerful and sophisticated, but the basic function the equipment serves is little different from that served by the equipment generally furnished by a television viewer.  If an individual erected an antenna on a hill, strung a cable to his house, and installed the necessary amplifying equipment, he would not be \'performing\' the programs he received on his television set.  The result would be no different if several people combined to erect a cooperative antenna for the same purpose.  The only difference in the case of CATV is that the antenna system is erected and owned not by its users, but by an entrepreneur. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 406 U.

Only qualified persons may obtain licenses, and they must operate in the public interest.  47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 308-309.  But nowhere in the Act is there the slightest suggestion that a person may be compelled to enter the broadcasting or cablecasting field.  Rather, the Act extends "to all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio . . . which <em>originates and/or is received</em> within the United States."  47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152(a) (emphasis added).  When the Commission jurisdiction is so limited, it strains logic to hold that this jurisdiction may be expanded by requiring someone to "originate" or "receive."</p>\n<p>The Act, when dealing with broadcasters, speaks of "applicants," "applications for licenses," <em>see</em> 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 307-308, and "whether the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served by the granting of such application."  47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 309(a).  The emphasis in the Committee Reports was on "original applications" and "application for the renewal of a license."  H.R.Rep. No.1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 48; S.Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 7, 9.  The idea that a carrier </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 406 U. S. 680</a></p><p> or any other person can be drafted against his will to become a broadcaster is completely foreign to the history of the Act, as I read it.</p>\n<p>CATV is simply a carrier, having no more control over the message content than does a telephone company.  A carrier may, of course, seek a broadcaster\'s license, but there is not the slightest suggestion in the Act or in its history that a carrier can be bludgeoned into becoming a broadcaster while all other broadcasters live under more lenient rules.  There is not the slightest clue in the Act that CATV carriers can be compulsorily converted into broadcasters.</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion performs the legerdemain by saying that the requirement of CATV origination is "reasonably ancillary" to the Commission\'s power to regulate television broadcasting. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] That requires a brand new amendment to the broadcasting provisions of the Act, which only the Congress can effect.  The Commission is not given <em>carte blanche</em> to initiate broadcasting stations; it cannot force people into the business.  It cannot say to one who applies for a broadcast outlet in city A that the need is greater in city B, and he will be licensed there.  The fact that the Commission has authority to regulate origination of programs if CATV decides to enter the field does not mean that it can compel CATV to originate programs.  The fact that the Act directs the Commission to encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest, 47 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 406 U. S. 681</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 303(g), relates to the objectives of the Act and does not grant power to compel people to become broadcasters any more than it grants the power to compel broadcasters to become CATV operators.</p>\n<p>The upshot of today\'s decision is to make the Commission\'s authority over activities "ancillary" to its responsibilities greater than its authority over any broadcast licensee.  Of course, the Commission can regulate a CATV that transmits broadcast signals.  But to entrust the Commission with the power to force some, a few, or all CATV operators into the broadcast business is to give it a forbidding authority.  Congress may decide to do so.  But the step is a legislative measure so extreme that we should not find it interstitially authorized in the vague language of the Act.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of the striking difference between origination and communication, the suggestion that "the regulation is no different from Commission rules governing the technological quality of CATV broadcast carriage," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#669">406 U. S. 669</a></span>, appears misconceived.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The separate opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE reaches the same result by saying</p>\n<p>"CATV is dependent totally on broadcast signals and is a significant link in the system as a whole, and therefore must be seen as within the jurisdiction of the Act."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#675">406 U. S. 675</a></span>.  The difficulty is that this analysis knows no limits short of complete domination of the field of communications by the Commission.  This reasoning -- divorced as it is from any specific statutory basis -- could as well apply to the manufacturers of radio and television broadcasting and receiving equipment.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
