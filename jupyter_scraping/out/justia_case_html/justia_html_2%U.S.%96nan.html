The articles purported to be for the sale of a house and five acres of land, for the consideration of L 1200, payable, L 700 in cash, and remainder in bonds. Daniel Longsdorff, who was produced as the witness to the execution of the articles, stated that he was called into a room by Stawaker (the contractor to sell) to witness the execution of the bonds; that when he came in, the papers were lying on a table before Lesher (the contractor to purchase) and Lesher desired him at to sign as a witness: That he did not actually fee Stawaker sign, seal, or deliver the papers, which he supposed to have been regularly executed before he was called in; but that he saw the money paid, and he knew the hand-writing to be Stawaker\'s: And that possession of the premises was afterwards, in pursuance of the agreement, delivered to one Harb, of whom Stawaker rented a room in the house in question, for L8. </p><p> The Counsel for the defendant opposed the admission of the articles of agreement, contending that there was no proof of the sealing and d livering, which are essential to a deed. </p><p> But by the Court: There is sufficient proof, that the instrument was signed by Stawaker; and, therefore, we shall let it go to the Jury; who will determine, for themselves, whether that, and the other circumstances in the case, are satisfactory evidence of sealing and delivery. </p><p></p><p> Rush, Justice </p><p> I differ in opinion from the rest of the Court. I think that before the instrument is read, sealing and delivering should be proved. If, indeed, the witnesses were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 2 U.S. 96, 97</a></p><p> proved to be dead, or absent beyond the reach of the process of the Court, the proof of their hand-writing would be admitted; or, if that was not practicable, proof of the hand-writing of the obligor might be satisfactory. But these circumstances do not occur on the present occasion; and as far as the testimony of Longsdorff goes, it is calculated to induce a belief that there was, in fact, no sealing and delivery of the instrument. It is not, therefore, proved as a deed; and, in my opinion, it ought not to be left to the Jury as a memorandum. </p><p> A bill of exceptions was taken to the opinion of the Court, but never prosecuted. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1921655">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> LESHER\'S LESSEE v.
