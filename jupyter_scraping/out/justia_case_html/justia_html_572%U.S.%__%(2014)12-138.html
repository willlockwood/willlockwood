At the time of BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s investment, Argentine law provided that gas \xe2\x80\x9ctariffs\xe2\x80\x9d would be calculated in U.\xc2\xa0S. dollars and would be set at levels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms a reasonable return.  But Argentina later amended the law, changing (among other things) the calculation basis to pesos.  MetroGAS\xe2\x80\x99 profits soon became losses.  Invoking Article 8, BG Group sought arbitration, which the parties sited in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  BG Group claimed that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s new laws and practices violated the Treaty, which forbids the \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriation\xe2\x80\x9d of investments and requires each nation to give \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable treatment\xe2\x80\x9d to investors from the other.  Argentina denied those claims, but also argued that the arbitrators lacked \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to hear the dispute because, as relevant here, BG Group had not complied with Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement.  The arbitration panel concluded that it had jurisdiction, finding, among other things, that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s conduct (such as also enacting new laws that hindered recourse to its judiciary by firms in BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s situation) had excused BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s requirement.  On the merits, the panel found that Argentina had not expropriated BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s investment but had denied BG Group \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  It awarded damages to BG Group.  Both sides sought review in federal district court: BG Group to confirm the award under the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and Argentina to vacate the award, in part on the ground that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction under the FAA.  The District Court confirmed the award, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated.  It found that the interpretation and application of Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s requirement were matters for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference to the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 views; that the circumstances did not excuse BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the requirement; and that BG Group had to commence a lawsuit in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts and wait 18 months before seeking arbitration.  Thus, the court held, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        1.\xc2\xa0A court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d provisions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for interpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts.  Under that framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply.  Courts should review their interpretation with deference.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (a)\xc2\xa0Were the Treaty an ordinary contract, it would call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provision.  In an ordinary contract, the parties determine whether a particular matter is primarily for arbitrators or for courts to decide.  See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co.,\n\n363 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574\n.  If the contract is silent on the matter of who is to decide a \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d question about arbitration, courts determine the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent using presumptions.  That is, courts presume that the parties intended courts to decide disputes about \xe2\x80\x9carbitrability,\xe2\x80\x9d e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79\n, and arbitrators to decide disputes about the meaning and application of procedural preconditions for the use of arbitration, see id., at 86, including, e.g., claims of \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability,\xe2\x80\x9d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, and the satisfaction of, e.g., \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98time limits, notice, laches, [or] estoppel,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Howsam, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85.  The provision at issue is of the procedural variety.  As its text and structure make clear, it determines when the contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to arbitrate at all.  Neither its language nor other language in Article 8 gives substantive weight to the local court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations on the matters at issue between the parties.  The litigation provision is thus a claims-processing rule.  It is analogous to other procedural provisions found to be for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply, see, e.g., ibid., and there is nothing in Article 8 or the Treaty to overcome the ordinary assumption.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0The fact that the document at issue is a treaty does not make a critical difference to this analysis.  A treaty is a contract between nations, and its interpretation normally is a matter of determining the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Air France v. Saks,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 392\n.  Where, as here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a motion to vacate or confirm an award made under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by American law.  The presence of a condition of \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d to arbitration in a treaty likely does not warrant abandoning, or increasing the complexity of, the ordinary intent-determining framework.  See, e.g., Howsam, supra, at 83\xe2\x80\x9385.  But because this Treaty does not state that the local litigation requirement is a condition of consent, the Court need not resolve what the effect of any such language would be.  The Court need not go beyond holding that in the absence of language in a treaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different delegation of authority, the ordinary interpretive framework applies.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0The Treaty contains no evidence showing that the parties had an intent contrary to the ordinary presumptions about who should decide threshold arbitration issues.  The text and structure of Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s litigation requirement make clear that it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration.  Because the ordinary presumption applies and is not overcome, the interpretation and application of the provision are primarily for the arbitrators, and courts must review their decision with considerable deference.

Their conclusion that the litigation provision cannot be construed as an absolute impediment to arbitration, in all cases, lies well within their interpretative authority.  Their factual findings that Argentina passed laws hindering recourse to the local judiciary by firms similar to BG Group are undisputed by Argentina and are accepted as valid.  And their conclusion that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s actions made it \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd and unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d to read Article 8 to require an investor in BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s position to bring its grievance in a domestic court, before arbitrating, is not barred by the Treaty.

See Agreementfor the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2), Dec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S. 38 (hereinafter Treaty).  The provision authorizes either party to submit a dispute \xe2\x80\x9cto the decision of the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., a local court.  Art. 8(1).

The question before us is whether a court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award made under the Treaty, should interpret and apply the local litigation requirement de\xc2\xa0novo, or with the deference that courts ordinarily owe arbitration decisions.  That is to say, who\xe2\x80\x94court or arbitrator\xe2\x80\x94bears primary responsibility for interpreting and applying the local litigation requirement to an underlying controversy?  In our view, the matter is for the arbitrators, and courts must review their determinations with deference.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the petitioner, BG Group plc, a British firm, belonged to a consortium that bought a majority interest in an Argentine entity called MetroGAS.  MetroGAS was a gas distribution company created by Argentine law in 1992, as a result of the government\xe2\x80\x99s privatization of its state-owned gas utility. Argentina distributed the utility\xe2\x80\x99s assets to new, private companies, one of which was MetroGAS.  It awarded MetroGAS a 35-year exclusive license to distribute natural gas in Buenos Aires, and it submitted a controlling interest in the company to international public tender.  BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s consor-tium was the successful bidder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At about the same time, Argentina enacted statutes providing that its regulators would calculate gas \xe2\x80\x9ctariffs\xe2\x80\x9d in U.\xc2\xa0S. dollars, and that those tariffs would be set at levels sufficient to assure gas distribution firms, such as MetroGAS, a reasonable return.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2001 and 2002, Argentina, faced with an economic crisis, enacted new laws.  Those laws changed the basis for calculating gas tariffs from dollars to pesos, at a rate of one peso per dollar.  The exchange rate at the time was roughly three pesos to the dollar.  The result was that MetroGAS\xe2\x80\x99 profits were quickly transformed into losses.  BG Group believed that these changes (and several others) violated the Treaty; Argentina believed the contrary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2003, BG Group, invoking Article 8 of the Treaty, sought arbitration.  The parties appointed arbitrators; they agreed to site the arbitration in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.; and between 2004 and 2006, the arbitrators decided motions, received evidence, and conducted hearings.  BG Group essentially claimed that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s new laws and regulatory practices violated provisions in the Treaty forbidding the \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriation\xe2\x80\x9d of investments and requiring that each nation give \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable treatment\xe2\x80\x9d to investors from the other.  Argentina denied these claims, while also arguing that the arbitration tribunal lacked \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to hear the dispute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 143a\xe2\x80\x93144a, 214a\xe2\x80\x93218a, 224a\xe2\x80\x93232a.  According to Argen-tina, the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction because: (1) BG Group was not a Treaty-protected \xe2\x80\x9cinvestor\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s interest in MetroGAS was not a Treaty-protected \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) BG Group initiated arbitration without first litigating its claims in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts, despite Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s requirement.  Id., at 143a\xe2\x80\x93171a.  In Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cfailure by BG to bring its grievance to Argentine courts for 18 months renders its claims in this arbitration inadmissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 162a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In late December 2007, the arbitration panel reached a final decision.  It began by determining that it had \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to consider the merits of the dispute.  In support of that determination, the tribunal concluded that BG Group was an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestor,\xe2\x80\x9d that its interest in MetroGAS amounted to a Treaty-protected \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct had waived, or excused, BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement.  Id., at 99a, 145a, 161a, 171a.  The panel pointed out that in 2002, the President of Argentina had issued a decree staying for 180 days the execution of its courts\xe2\x80\x99 final judgments (and injunctions) in suits claiming harm as a result of the new economic measures.  Id., at 166a\xe2\x80\x93167a.  In addition, Argentina had established a \xe2\x80\x9crenegotiation process\xe2\x80\x9d for public service contracts, such as its contract with MetroGAS, to alleviate the negative impact of the new economic measures.  Id., at 129a, 131a.  But Argentina had simultaneously barred from participation in that \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d firms that were litigating against Argentina in court or in arbitration.  Id., at 168a\xe2\x80\x93171a.  These measures, while not making litigation in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts literally impossible, nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9chindered\xe2\x80\x9d recourse \xe2\x80\x9cto the domestic judiciary\xe2\x80\x9d to the point where the Treaty implicitly excused compliance with the local litigation requirement.  Id., at 165.  Requiring a private party in such circumstances to seek relief in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts for 18 months, the panel concluded, would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd and unreasonable result[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 166a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On the merits, the arbitration panel agreed with Argentina that it had not \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s investment, but also found that Argentina had denied BG Group \xe2\x80\x9cfair and equitable treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 222a\xe2\x80\x93223a, 240a\xe2\x80\x93242a.  It awarded BG Group $185 million in damages.  Id., at 297a.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In March 2008, both sides filed petitions for review in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  BG Group sought to confirm the award under the New York Convention and the Federal Arbitration Act.  See Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, Art. IV, June 10, 1958, 21 U. S. T. 2519, T. I. A. S. No. 6997 (New York Convention) (providing that a party may apply \xe2\x80\x9cfor recognition and enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of an arbitral award subject to the Convention); 9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7204, 207 (providing that a party may move \xe2\x80\x9cfor an order confirming [an arbitral] award\xe2\x80\x9d in a federal court of the \xe2\x80\x9cplace designated in the agreement as the place of arbitration if such place is within the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Argentina sought to vacate the award in part on the ground that the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction.  See \xc2\xa710(a)(4) (a federal court may vacate an arbitral award \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court denied Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s claims and confirmed the award.  764 F. Supp. 2d 21 (DC 2011); 715 F. Supp. 2d 108 (DC 2010).  But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  665 F. 3d 1363 (2012).  In the appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the interpretation and application of Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement was a matter for courts to decide de novo, i.e., without deference to the views of the arbitrators.  The Court of Appeals then went on to hold that the circumstances did not excuse BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the requirement.  Rather, BG Group must \xe2\x80\x9ccommence a lawsuit in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts and wait eighteen months before filing for arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1373.  Because BG Group had not done so, the arbitrators lacked authority to decide the dispute.  And the appeals court ordered the award vacated.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        BG Group filed a petition for certiorari.  Given the importance of the matter for international commercial ar-bitration, we granted the petition.  See, e.g., K. Van-develde, Bilateral Investment Treaties: History, Policy&amp; Interpretation 430\xe2\x80\x93432 (2010) (explaining that dispute-resolution mechanisms allowing for arbitration are a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical element\xe2\x80\x9d of modern day bilateral investment treaties); C.

Put in terms of standards of judicial review, should a United States court review the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation and application of the provision de\xc2\xa0novo, or with the deference that courts ordinarily show arbitral decisions on matters the parties have committed to arbitration?  Compare, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.

See Howsam, supra, at 86 (courts assume parties \xe2\x80\x9cnormally expect a forum-based decisionmaker to decide forum-specific procedural gateway matters\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  These procedural matters include claims of \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,\n\n460 U.

And they include the satisfaction of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prerequisites such as time limits, notice, laches, estoppel, and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Howsam, supra, at 85 (quoting the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 \xc2\xa76, Comment 2, 7 U. L.\xc2\xa0A. 13 (Supp. 2002); emphasis deleted).  See also \xc2\xa76(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa76, Comment 2 (explaining that this rule reflects \xe2\x80\x9cthe holdings of the vast majority of state courts\xe2\x80\x9d and collecting cases).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The provision before us is of the latter, procedural, variety.  The text and structure of the provision make clear that it operates as a procedural condition precedent to arbitration.  It says that a dispute \xe2\x80\x9cshall be submitted to international arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cone of the Parties so requests,\xe2\x80\x9d as long as \xe2\x80\x9ca period of eighteen months has elapsed\xe2\x80\x9d since the dispute was \xe2\x80\x9csubmitted\xe2\x80\x9d to a local tribunal and the tribunal \xe2\x80\x9chas not given its final decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(2).  It determines when the contractual duty to arbitrate arises, not whether there is a contractual duty to arbitrate at all.  Cf. 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa738:7, pp. 435, 437; \xc2\xa738:4, p. 422 (4th ed. 2013) (a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition precedent\xe2\x80\x9d determines what must happen before \xe2\x80\x9ca contractual duty arises\xe2\x80\x9d but does not \xe2\x80\x9cmake the validity of the contract depend on its happening\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Neither does this language or other language in Article 8 give substantive weight to the local court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations on the matters at issue between the parties.  To the contrary, Article 8 provides that only the \xe2\x80\x9carbitration decision shall be final and binding on both Parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(4).  The litigation provision is consequently a purely procedural requirement\xe2\x80\x94a claims-processing rule that governs when the arbitration may begin, but not whether it may occur or what its substantive outcome will be on the issues in dispute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, the local litigation requirement is highly analogous to procedural provisions that both this Court and others have found are for arbitrators, not courts, primarily to interpret and to apply.  See Howsam, supra, at 85 (whether a party filed a notice of arbitration within the time limit provided by the rules of the chosen arbitral forum \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter presumptively for the arbitrator, not for the judge\xe2\x80\x9d); John Wiley, supra, at 555\xe2\x80\x93557 (same, in respect to a mandatory prearbitration grievance procedure that involved holding two conferences).  See also Dialysis Access Center, LLC v. RMS Lifeline, Inc., 638 F. 3d 367, 383 (CA1 2011) (same, in respect to a prearbitration \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith negotiations\xe2\x80\x9d requirement); Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Broadspire Management Servs., Inc., 623 F. 3d 476, 481 (CA7 2010) (same, in respect to a prearbitration filing of a \xe2\x80\x9cDisagreement Notice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, as we later discuss in more detail, see infra, at\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314, we can find nothing in Article 8 or elsewhere in the Treaty that might overcome the ordinary assumption. It nowhere demonstrates a contrary intent as to the delegation of decisional authority between judges and arbitrators.  Thus, were the document an ordinary contract, it would call for arbitrators primarily to interpret and to apply the local litigation provision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We now relax our ordinary contract assumption and ask whether the fact that the document before us is a treaty makes a critical difference to our analysis.  The Solicitor General argues that it should.  He says that the local litigation provision may be \xe2\x80\x9ca condition on the State\xe2\x80\x99s consent to enter into an arbitration agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.  He adds that courts should \xe2\x80\x9creview de novo the arbitral tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of objections based on an investor\xe2\x80\x99s non-compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with such a condition.  Ibid.  And he recommends that we remand this case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the court-exhaustion provision is such a condition.  Id., at 31\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We do not accept the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s view as applied to the treaty before us.  As a general matter, a treaty isa contract, though between nations.  Its interpretation normally is, like a contract\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, a matter of determining the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Air France v. Saks,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 392,\n399 (1985)\n (courts must give \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d); Sullivan v. Kidd,\n\n254 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433,\n439 (1921)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]reaties are to be interpreted upon the principles which govern the interpretation of contracts in writing between individuals, and are to be executed in the utmost good faith, with a view to making effective the purposes of the high contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d); Wright v. Henkel,\n\n190 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40,\n57 (1903)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cTreaties must receive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of the contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d).  And where, as here, a federal court is asked to interpret that intent pursuant to a motion to vacate or confirm an award made in the United States under the Federal Arbitration Act, it should normally apply the presumptions supplied by American law.  See New York Convention, Art. V(1)(e) (award may be \xe2\x80\x9cset aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made\xe2\x80\x9d); Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties, at 446 (arbitral awards pursuant to treaties are \xe2\x80\x9csubject to review under the arbitration law of the state where the arbitration takes place\xe2\x80\x9d); Dugan, Investor-State Arbitration, at 636 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he national courts and the law of the legal situs of arbitration control a losing party\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to set aside [an] award\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Solicitor General does not deny that the presumption discussed in Part III, supra (namely, the presumption that parties intend procedural preconditions to arbitration to be resolved primarily by arbitrators), applies both to ordinary contracts and to similar provisions in treaties when those provisions are not also \xe2\x80\x9cconditions of consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  And, while we respect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s views about the proper interpretation of treaties, e.g., Abbott v. Abbott,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n15 (2010)\n, we have been unable to find any other authority or precedent suggesting that the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d label in a treaty should make a critical differencein discerning the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent about whether courtsor arbitrators should interpret and apply the relevant provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We are willing to assume with the Solicitor General that the appearance of this label in a treaty can show that the parties, or one of them, thought the designated matter quite important.  But that is unlikely to be conclusive.  For parties often submit important matters to arbitration.  And the word \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d could be attached to a highly procedural precondition to arbitration, such as a waiting period of several months, which the parties are unlikely to have intended that courts apply without saying so.  See, e.g., Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, Art. 9, Netherlands-Slovenia, Sept. 24, 1996, Netherlands T. S. No. 296 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any dispute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which they can not [sic] solve amicably within three months .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the International Center for Settlement of Disputesfor settlement by conciliation or arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d), online at www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/besluiten/2006/10/17/slovenia.html (all Internet materials as visited on Feb. 28, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Agreement for the Promotion and Protection ofInvestments, Art. 8(1), United Kingdom-Egypt, June 11, 1975, 14 I. L. M. 1472 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit\xe2\x80\x9d a dispute to arbitration if \xe2\x80\x9cagreement cannot be reached within three months between the parties\xe2\x80\x9d).  While we leave the matter open for future argument, we do not now see why the presence of the term \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d in a treaty warrants abandoning, or increasing the complexity of, our ordinary intent-determining framework.  See Howsam, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83\xe2\x80\x9385; First Options, 514 U. S., at 942\xe2\x80\x93945; John Wiley, 376 U. S., at 546\xe2\x80\x93549, 555\xe2\x80\x93559.</p>\n<p style="p-H2">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any event, the treaty before us does not state that the local litigation requirement is a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition of consent\xe2\x80\x9d to arbitration.  Thus, we need not, and do not, go beyond holding that, in the absence of explicit language in atreaty demonstrating that the parties intended a different delegation of authority, our ordinary interpretive framework applies.  We leave for another day the question of interpreting treaties that refer to \xe2\x80\x9cconditions of consent\xe2\x80\x9d explicitly.  See, e.g., United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, Art. 11.18, Feb. 10, 2011 (provision entitled \xe2\x80\x9cConditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party\xe2\x80\x9d and providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o claim may be submitted toarbitration under this Section\xe2\x80\x9d unless the claimantwaives in writing \xe2\x80\x9cany right\xe2\x80\x9d to press his claim beforean \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative tribunal or court\xe2\x80\x9d), online at www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/korus-fta/final-text; North American Free Trade Agreement, Arts.  1121\xe2\x80\x931122, Dec. 17, 1992, 32 I.

And we apply our ordinary presumption that the interpretation and application of procedural provisions such as the provision before us are primarily for the arbitrators.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A treaty may contain evidence that shows the parties had an intent contrary to our ordinary presumptions about who should decide threshold issues related to arbitration.  But the treaty before us does not show any such contrary intention.  We concede that the local litigation requirement appears in \xc2\xb6(1) of Article 8, while the Article does not mention arbitration until the subsequent paragraph, \xc2\xb6(2).  Moreover, a requirement that a party exhaust its remedies in a country\xe2\x80\x99s domestic courts before seeking to arbitrate may seem particularly important to a country offering protections to foreign investors.  And the placing of an important matter prior to any mention of arbitration at least arguably suggests an intent by Argentina, the United Kingdom, or both, to have courts rather than arbitrators apply the litigation requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        These considerations, however, are outweighed by others.  As discussed supra, at\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939, the text and structure of the litigation requirement set forth in Article 8 make clear that it is a procedural condition precedent to arbitration\xe2\x80\x94a sequential step that a party must follow before giving notice of arbitration.  The Treaty nowhere says that the provision is to operate as a substantive condition on the formation of the arbitration contract, or that it is a matter of such elevated importance that it is to be decided by courts.  International arbitrators are likely more familiar than are judges with the expectations of foreign investors and recipient nations regarding the operation of the provision.  See Howsam, supra, at 85 (comparative institutional expertise a factor in determining parties\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent).  And the Treaty itself authorizes the use of international arbitration associations, the rules of which provide that arbitrators shall have the authority to interpret provisions of this kind.  Art. 8(3) (providing that the parties may refer a dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or to arbitrators appointed pursuant to the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)); accord, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Art. 23(1) (rev. 2010 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]rbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d); ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, Art. 41(1) (2006 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cTribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. Howsam, supra, at 85 (giving weight to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 incorporation of the National Association of Securities Dealers\xe2\x80\x99 Code of Arbitration into their contract, which provided for similar arbitral authority, as evidence that they intended arbitrators to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret and apply the NASD time limit rule\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The upshot is that our ordinary presumption applies and it is not overcome.  The interpretation and application of the local litigation provision is primarily for the arbi-trators.  Reviewing courts cannot review their decisionde novo.  Rather, they must do so with considerabledeference.</p>\n<p style="p-H2">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The dissent interprets Article 8\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation provision differently.  In its view, the provision sets forth not a condition precedent to arbitration in an already-binding arbitration contract (normally a matter for arbitrators to interpret), but a substantive condition on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s con-sent to arbitration and thus on the contract\xe2\x80\x99s formationin the first place (normally something for courts to interpret).  It reads the whole of Article 8 as a \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral standing offer\xe2\x80\x9d to arbitrate that Argentina and the United Kingdom each extends to investors of the other country.  Post, at 9 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  And it says that the local litigation requirement is one of the essential \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98terms in which the offer was made.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Post, at 6 (quoting Eliason v. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 225, 228 (1819); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While it is possible to read the provision in this way, doing so is not consistent with our case law interpreting similar provisions appearing in ordinary arbitration contracts.  See Part III, supra.  Consequently, interpreting the provision in such a manner would require us to treat treaties as warranting a different kind of analysis.  And the dissent does so without supplying any different set of general principles that might guide that analysis.  That is a matter of some concern in a world where foreign investment and related arbitration treaties increasingly matter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">     Even were we to ignore our ordinary contract principles, however, we would not take the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view.  As we have explained, the local litigation provision on its face concerns arbitration\xe2\x80\x99s timing, not the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s effective date; or whom its arbitration clause binds; or whether that arbitration clause covers a certain kind of dispute.  Cf. Granite Rock, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 296\xe2\x80\x93303 (ratification date); First Options, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 941, 943\xe2\x80\x93947 (parties); AT&amp;T Technologies, 475 U. S., at 651 (kind of dispute).  The dissent points out that Article 8(2)(a) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not simply require the parties to wait for 18 months before proceeding to arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d but instructs them to do something\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9csubmit their claims for adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 8.  That is correct.  But the something they must do has no direct impact on the resolution of their dispute, for as we previously pointed out, Article 8 provides that only the decision of the arbitrators (who need not give weight to the local court\xe2\x80\x99s decision) will be \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and binding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(4).  The provision, at base, is a claims-processing rule.  And the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to imbue it with greater significance fall short.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The treatises to which the dissent refers also fail to support its position.  Post, at 3, 6.  Those authorities primarily describe how an offer to arbitrate in an investment treaty can be accepted, such as through an investor\xe2\x80\x99s filing of a notice of arbitration.  See J. Salacuse, The Law of Investment Treaties 381 (2010); Schreuer, Consent to Arbitration, in The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law 830, 836\xe2\x80\x93837 (P. Muchlinski, F.

See 1 G.

We also agree that sovereigns can condition their consent to arbitrate by writing various terms into their bilateral investment treaties.  Post, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But that is not the issue.  The question is whether the parties intended to give courts or arbitrators primary authority to interpret and apply a threshold provision in an arbitration contract\xe2\x80\x94when the contract is silent as to the delegation of authority.  We have already explained why we believe that where, as here, the provision resembles a claims-processing requirement and is not a requirement that affects the arbitration contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity or scope, we presume that the parties (even if they are sovereigns) intended to give that authority to the arbitrators.

Id., at 166a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first determination lies well within the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 interpretive authority.  Construing the local litigation provision as an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute\xe2\x80\x9d requirement would mean Argentina could avoid arbitration by, say, passing a law that closed down its court system indefinitely or that prohibited investors from using its courts.  Such an interpretation runs contrary to a basic objective of the investment treaty.  Nor does Argentina argue for an absolute interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As to the second determination, Argentina does not argue that the facts set forth by the arbitrators are incorrect.

Argen-tina argues that neither the 180-day suspension of courts\xe2\x80\x99 issuances of final judgments nor its refusal to allow litigants (and those in arbitration) to use its contract renegotiation process, taken separately or together, warrants suspending or waiving the local litigation requirement.  We would not necessarily characterize these actions as rendering a domestic court-exhaustion requirement \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd and unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d but at the same time we cannot say that the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions are barred by the Treaty.  The arbitrators did not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stra[y] from interpretation and application of the agreement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effectively \xe2\x80\x9cdispens[e]\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98own brand of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Stolt-Nielsen S.

Ante, at 8, 14.  Importantly, in reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe treaty before us does not state that the local litiga-tion requirement is a \xe2\x80\x98condition of consent\xe2\x80\x99 to arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  The Court thus wisely \xe2\x80\x9cleave[s] for another day the question of interpreting treaties that refer to \xe2\x80\x98conditions of consent\xe2\x80\x99 explicitly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The Court appears to suggest in dictum that a decision by treaty parties to describe a condition as one on their consent to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9cis unlikely to be conclusive\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding whether the parties intended for the condition to be resolved by a court.  Ante, at 11.  Because this suggestion is unnecessary to decide the case and is in tension with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s explicit reservation of the issue, I join the opinion of the Court with the exception of Part IV\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x931.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s dictum on this point is not only unnecessary; it may also be incorrect.  It is far from clear that a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s express use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a precondition to arbitration should not be conclusive in the analysis.  We have held, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9ca gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause raises a \xe2\x80\x98question of arbitrability\xe2\x80\x99 for a court to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79,\n84 (2002)\n.  And a party plainly cannot be bound by an arbitration clause to which it does not consent.  See Granite Rock Co. v.

In this setting, a nation-state might reasonably wish to condition its consent to arbitrate with a previously unspecified investor counterparty on the investor\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with a requirement that might be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cpurely procedural\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary commercial context, ante, at 9.

That provision declares that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d unless a claimant first waives its \xe2\x80\x9cright to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach\xe2\x80\x9d under another provision of the treaty.  Ibid.  If this waiver con-dition were to appear without the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d label in a binding arbitration agreement between two commercial parties, one might characterize it as the kind of procedural \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98condition precedent to arbitrability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that we presume parties intend for arbitrators to decide.  Howsam, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85.  But where the waiver requirement is ex-pressly denominated a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition on consent\xe2\x80\x9d in an interna-tional investment treaty, the label could well be critical in determining whether the states party to the treaty in-tended the condition to be reviewed by a court.  After all, a dispute as to consent is \xe2\x80\x9cthe starkest form of the question whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 13.  And we ordinarily presume that parties intend for courts to decide such questions because otherwise arbitrators might \xe2\x80\x9cforce unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.

As it is, how-ever, all parties agree that the local litigation requirement is not so denominated.  See Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(2), Dec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.  Nor is there compelling reason to suppose the parties silently intended to make it a condition on their consent to arbitrate, given that a local court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is of no legal significance under the treaty, ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and given that the entire purpose of bilateral investment agreements is to \xe2\x80\x9creliev[e] investors of any concern that the courts of host countries will be unable or unwilling to provide justice in a dispute between a foreigner and their own government,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Professors and Practitioners of Arbitration Law as Amici Curiae 6.  Moreover, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s conduct confirms that the local litigation requirement is not a condition on consent, for rather than objecting to arbitration on the ground that there was no binding arbitration agreement to begin with, Argentina actively participated in the constitution of the arbitral panel and in the proceedings that followed.  See Eastern Airlines, Inc. v.

But there is a difference between arguing that a party has failed to comply with a procedural condition in a binding arbitration agreement and arguing that noncompliance with the condition negates the existence of consent to arbitrate in the first place.  Argentina points to no evidence that its objection was of the consent variety.  This omission is notable because Argentina knew how to phrase its arguments before the arbitrators in terms of consent; it argued separately that it had not consented to arbitration with BG Group on the ground that BG was not a party to the license underlying the dispute.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a\xe2\x80\x93186a.   v. ,\n, is not to the contrary, as that case held that \xe2\x80\x9carguing the arbitrability issue to an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x9d did not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] and unmistakabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d evidence sufficient to override an indisputably applicable presumption that a court was to decide whether the parties had agreed to arbitration.  ,at 944, 946.  The question here, by contrast, is whether that presumption attaches to begin with\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the local litigation requirement was a condition on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate (which would trigger the presumption) or a procedural condition in an already binding arbitration agreement (which would not).

The \xe2\x80\x9cdocument before us,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, is nothing of the sort.  It is instead a treaty between two sovereign nations: the United Kingdom and Argentina.

That document is a bilateral investment treaty between the United Kingdom and Argentina, in which Argentina agreed to take steps to encourage U.\xc2\xa0K. investors to invest within its borders (and the United Kingdom agreed to do the same with respect to Argentine investors).  Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Dec. 11, 1990, 1765 U. N. T. S. 33 (Treaty).  The Treaty does indeed contain a completed agreement for arbitration\xe2\x80\x94between the signatory countries.  Art. 9.  The Treaty also includes, in Article 8, certain provisions for resolving any disputes that might arise between a signatory country and an investor, who is not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        One such provision\xe2\x80\x94completely ignored by the Court in its analysis\xe2\x80\x94specifies that disputes may be resolved by arbitration when the host country and an investor \xe2\x80\x9chave so agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(2)(b), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.  No one doubts that, as is the normal rule, whether there was such an agreement is for a court, not an arbitrator, to decide.  See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938\n\xe2\x80\x93945 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When there is no express agreement between the host country and an investor, they must form an agreement in another way, before an obligation to arbitrate arises.  The Treaty by itself cannot constitute an agreement to arbitrate with an investor.  How could it?  No investor is a party to that Treaty.  Something else must happen to create an agreement where there was none before.  Article 8(2)(a) makes clear what that something is: An investor must submit his dispute to the courts of the host country.  After 18 months, or an unsatisfactory decision, the investor may then request arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Submitting the dispute to the courts is thus a condition to the formation of an agreement, not simply a matter of performing an existing agreement.  Article 8(2)(a) constitutes in effect a unilateral offer to arbitrate, which an investor may accept by complying with its terms.  To be sure, the local litigation requirement might not be absolute.  In particular, an investor might argue that it was an implicit aspect of the unilateral offer that he be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit his dispute to the local courts.  Even then, however, the question would remain whether the investor has managed to form an arbitration agreement with the host country pursuant to Article 8(2)(a).  That question under Article 8(2)(a) is\xe2\x80\x94like the same question under Article 8(2)(b)\xe2\x80\x94for a court, not an arbitrator, to decide.  I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority acknowledges\xe2\x80\x94but fails to heed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe first principle that underscores all of our arbitration decisions: Arbitration is strictly \xe2\x80\x98a matter of consent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287,\n299 (2010)\n (quoting Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 468,\n479 (1989)\n); see ante, at 7.  We have accordingly held that arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cis a way to resolve those disputes\xe2\x80\x94but only those disputes\xe2\x80\x94that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  First Options of Chicago, Inc., supra, at 943.  The same \xe2\x80\x9cfirst principle\xe2\x80\x9d underlies arbitration pursuant to bilateral investment treaties.  See C. Dugan, D. Wallace, N. Rubins, &amp; B. Sabahi, Investor-State Arbitration 219 (2008) (Dugan); J. Salacuse, The Law of Investment Treaties 385 (2010); K. Vandevelde, Bilateral Investment Treaties: History, Policy, and Interpretation 433 (2010).  So only if Argentina agreed with BG Group to have an arbitrator resolve their dispute did the arbitrator in this case have any authority over the parties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority opinion nowhere explains when and how Argentina agreed with BG Group to submit to arbitration.  Instead, the majority seems to assume that, in agreeing with the United Kingdom to adopt Article 8 along with the rest of the Treaty, Argentina thereby formed an agreement with all potential U.\xc2\xa0K. investors (including BG Group) to submit all investment-related disputes to arbitration.  That misunderstands Article 8 and trivializes the significance to a sovereign nation of subjecting itself to arbitration anywhere in the world, solely at the option of private parties.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority focuses throughout its opinion on what it calls the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carbitration clause,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 1, but that provision does not stand alone.  Rather, it is only part\xe2\x80\x94and a subordinate part at that\xe2\x80\x94of a broader dispute resolution provision.  Article 8 is thus entitled \xe2\x80\x9cSettlement of Disputes Between an Investor and the Host State,\xe2\x80\x9d and it opens without so much as mentioning arbitration. 1765 U. N. T. S. 37.  Instead it initially directs any disputing investor and signatory country (what the Treaty calls a \xe2\x80\x9cContracting Party\xe2\x80\x9d) to court.  When \xe2\x80\x9can investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x9d have an investment-related dispute that has \xe2\x80\x9cnot been amicably settled,\xe2\x80\x9d the Treaty commands that the dispute \xe2\x80\x9cshall be submitted, at the request of one of the Parties to the dispute, to the decision of the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(1), id., at 37\xe2\x80\x9338. (emphasis added).  This provision could not be clearer: Before taking any other steps, an aggrieved investor must submit its dispute with a Contracting Party to that Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s own courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There are two routes to arbitration in Article 8(2)(a), and each passes through a Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s domestic courts.  That is, the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration provisions in Article 8(2)(a) presuppose that the parties have complied with the local litigation provision in Article 8(1).  Specifically, a party may request arbitration only (1) \xe2\x80\x9cafter a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe said tribunal has not given its final decision,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 8(2)(a)(i), id., at 38, or (2) \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the final decision of the aforementioned tribunal has been made but the Parties are still in dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 8(2)(a)(ii), ibid.  Either way, the obligation to arbitrate does not arise until the Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s courts have had a first crack at the dispute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Article 8 provides a third route to arbitration in paragraph 8(2)(b)\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party have so agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In contrast to the two routes in Article 8(2)(a), this one does not refer to the local litigation provision.  That omission is significant.  It makes clear that an investor can bypass local litigation only by obtaining the Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s explicit agreement to proceed directly to arbitration.  Short of that, an investor has no choice but to litigate in the Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s courts for at least some period.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The structure of Article 8 confirms that the routes to arbitration in paragraph (2)(a) are just as much about eliciting a Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate as the route in paragraph 8(2)(b).  Under Article 8(2)(b), the requisite consent is demonstrated by a specific agreement.  Under Article 8(2)(a), the requisite consent is demonstrated by compliance with the requirement to resort to a country\xe2\x80\x99s local courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Whereas Article 8(2)(a) is part of a completed agreement between Argentina and the United Kingdom, it constitutes only a unilateral standing offer by Argentina with respect to U.\xc2\xa0K. investors\xe2\x80\x94an offer to submit to arbitration where certain conditions are met.  That is how scholars understand arbitration provisions in bilateral investment treaties in general.  See Dugan 221; Salacuse 381; Brief for Practitioners and Professors of International Arbitration Law as Amici Curiae 4.  And it is how BG Group itself describes this investment treaty in particular.  See Brief for Petitioner 43 (the Treaty is a \xe2\x80\x9cstanding offer\xe2\x80\x9d by Argentina \xe2\x80\x9cto arbitrate\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief 9 (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        An offer must be accepted for a legally binding contract to be formed.  And it is an \xe2\x80\x9cundeniable principle of the law of contracts, that an offer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by one person to another, imposes no obligation upon the former, until it is accepted by the latter, according to the terms in which the offerwas made.  Any qualification of, or departure from, those terms, invalidates the offer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Eliason v. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 225, 228 (1819) (emphasis added).  This principle applies to international arbitration agreements just as it does to domestic commercial contracts.  See Dugan 221\xe2\x80\x93222; Salacuse 381; Schreuer, Consent to Arbitration, in The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law 830, 836\xe2\x80\x93837 (P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino, &amp; C. Schreuer eds. 2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        By incorporating the local litigation provision in Article 8(1), paragraph 8(2)(a) establishes that provision as a term of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral offer to arbitrate.  To accept Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s offer, an investor must therefore first litigate its dispute in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts\xe2\x80\x94either to a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d or for 18 months, whichever comes first.  Unless the investor does so (or, perhaps, establishes a valid excuse for failing to do so, as discussed below, see infra, at 17), it has not accepted the terms of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s offer to arbitrate, and thus has not formed an arbitration agreement with Argentina.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the majority suggests that the local litigation requirement would not be a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition of consent\xe2\x80\x9d even if the Treaty explicitly called it one, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is limited to treaties that contain no such clear statement.  See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  But there is no reason to think that such a clear statement should be required, for we generally do not require \xe2\x80\x9ctalismanic words\xe2\x80\x9d in treaties.  Medell\xc3\xadnv. Texas,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491,\n521 (2008)\n.  Indeed, another arbi-tral tribunal concluded that the local litigation require-ment was a condition on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate despite the absence of the sort of clear statement apparently contemplated by the majority.  See ICS Inspection &amp; Control Servs. Ltd. v. Argentine Republic, PCA Case No. 2010\xe2\x80\x939, Award on Jurisdiction, \xc2\xb6262 (Feb. 10, 2012).  Still other tribunals have reached the same conclusion with regard to similar litigation requirements in other Argentine bilateral investment treaties.  See Daimler Financial Servs. AG v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6193, 194 (Aug. 22, 2012); Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award, \xc2\xb6116 (Dec. 8, 2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the face of this authority, the majority quotes a treatise for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] substantial body of arbitral authority from investor-state disputes concludes that compliance with procedural mechanisms in an arbitration agreement (or bilateral investment treaty) is not ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16 (quoting 1 G. Born, International Commercial Arbitration 842 (2009)).  But that simply restates the question.  The whole issue is whether the local litigation requirement is a mere \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural mechanism\xe2\x80\x9d or instead a condition on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        BG Group concedes that other terms of Article 8(1) constitute conditions on Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate, even though they are not expressly labeled as such.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57 (\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be a U. K. investor, you have to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to the treaty.  And if those aren\xe2\x80\x99t true, then there is no arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The Court does not explain why the only other term\xe2\x80\x94the litigation requirement\xe2\x80\x94should be viewed differently.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading accord with ordinary contract law, which treats language such as the word \xe2\x80\x9cafter\xe2\x80\x9d in Article 8(2)(a)(i) as creating conditions, even though such language may not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cclear state-ment.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa738:16 (4th ed. 2013).  The majority seems to regard the local litigation requirement as a condition precedent to performance of the contract, rather than a condition precedent to formation of the contract.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939; see 13 Lord \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa738:4, 38:7.  But that cannot be.  Prior to the fulfillment ofthe local litigation requirement, there was no contract be-tween Argentina and BG Group to be performed.  The Treaty is not such an agreement, since BG Group is of course not a party to the Treaty.  Neither the majority nor BG Group contends that the agreement is under Article 8(2)(b), the provision that applies \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party have so agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d  An arbitration agreement must be formed, and Article 8(2)(a) spells out how an investor may do that: by submitting the dispute to local courts for 18 months or until a decision is rendered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement certainly does not resemble \xe2\x80\x9ctime limits, notice, laches, estoppel,\xe2\x80\x9d or the other kinds of provisions that are typically treated as conditions on the performance of an arbitra-tion agreement, rather than prerequisites to formation.  Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 \xc2\xa76(c), Comment 2, 7 U. L.\xc2\xa0A. 26 (2009).  Unlike a time limit for submitting a claim to arbitration, see Howsam v. Dean Witter Rey-nolds, Inc.,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79,\n85 (2002)\n, the litigation requirement does not simply regulate the timing of arbitration.  As the majority recognizes, ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, the provision does not simply require the parties to wait for 18 months before proceeding to arbitration, but instead requires them to submit their claims for adjudication during that period.  And unlike a mandatory pre-arbitration grievance procedure, see John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,\n\n376 U. S. 543\n\xe2\x80\x93559 (1964), the litigation requirement sends the parties to court\xe2\x80\x94and not just any court, but a court of the host country.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The law of international arbitration and domestic contract law lead to the same conclusion: Because paragraph (2)(a) of Article 8 constitutes only a unilateral standing offer by the Contracting Parties to each other\xe2\x80\x99s investors to submit to arbitration under certain conditions, an investor cannot form an arbitration agreement with a Contracting Party under the Treaty until the investor accepts the actual terms of the Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s offer.  Absent a valid excuse, that means litigating its dispute in the Contracting Party\xe2\x80\x99s courts to a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d or, barring that, for at least 18 months.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The nature of the obligations a sovereign incurs in agreeing to arbitrate with a private party confirms that the local litigation requirement is a condition on a signatory country\xe2\x80\x99s consent to arbitrate, and not merely a condi-tion on performance of a pre-existing arbitration agreement.  There are good reasons for any sovereign to condition its consent to arbitrate disputes on investors\xe2\x80\x99 first litigating their claims in the country\xe2\x80\x99s own courts for a specified period.  It is no trifling matter for a sovereign nation to subject itself to suit by private parties; we do not presume that any country\xe2\x80\x94including our own\xe2\x80\x94takes that step lightly.  Cf. United States v. Bormes, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (Congress must \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocally express[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d its intent to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States (quoting United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30,\n33 (1992)\n; internal quotation marks omitted)).  But even where a sovereign nation has subjected itself to suit in its own courts, it is quite another thingfor it to subject itself to international arbitration.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[g]ranting a private party the right to bring an action against a sovereign state in an international tribunal regarding an investment dispute is a revolutionary innovation\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cuniqueness and power should not be over-looked.\xe2\x80\x9d  Salacuse 137.  That is so because of both the procedure and substance of investor-state arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Procedurally, paragraph (3) of Article 8 designates the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) as the default rules governing the arbitration.  Those rules authorize the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague to designate an \xe2\x80\x9cappointing authority\xe2\x80\x9d who\xe2\x80\x94absent agreement by the parties\xe2\x80\x94can select the sole arbitrator (or, in the case of a three-member tribunal, the presiding arbitrator, where the arbitrators nominated by each of the parties cannot agree on a presiding arbitrator).  UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Arts. 6, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (rev. 2010 ed.).  The arbitrators, in turn, select the site of the arbitration (again, absent an agreement by the parties) and enjoy broad discretion in conducting the proceedings.  Arts. 18, 17(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Substantively, by acquiescing to arbitration, a state permits private adjudicators to review its public policies and effectively annul the authoritative acts of its legislature, executive, and judiciary.  See Salacuse 355; G. Van Harten, Investment Treaty Arbitration and Public Law 65\xe2\x80\x9367 (2007).  Consider the dispute that gave rise to this case: Before the arbitral tribunal, BG Group challenged multiple sovereign acts of the Argentine Government taken after the Argentine economy collapsed in 2001\xe2\x80\x94in particular, Emergency Law 25,561, which converted dollar-denominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at arate of one Argentine peso to one U.\xc2\xa0S. dollar; Resolution 308/02 and Decree 1090/02, which established a renegotiation process for public service contracts; and Decree 214/02, which stayed for 180 days injunctions and the execution of final judgments in lawsuits challenging the effects of the Emergency Law.  Indeed, in awarding damages to BG Group, the tribunal held that the first three of these enactments violated Article 2 of the Treaty.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a\xe2\x80\x93242a, 305a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Perhaps they did, but that is not the issue.  Under Article 8, a Contracting Party grants to private adjudicators not necessarily of its own choosing, who can meet literally anywhere in the world, a power it typically reserves to its own courts, if it grants it at all: the power to sit in judgment on its sovereign acts.  Given these stakes, one would expect the United Kingdom and Argentina to have taken particular care in specifying the limited circumstances in which foreign investors can trigger the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration process.  And that is precisely what they did in Article 8(2)(a), requiring investors to afford a country\xe2\x80\x99s own courts an initial opportunity to review the country\xe2\x80\x99s enactments and assess the country\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with its international obligations.  Contrast this with Article 9, which provides for arbitration between the signatory countries of disputes under the Treaty without any preconditions.  Argentina and the United Kingdom considered arbitration with particular foreign investors to be different in kind and to require special limitations on its use.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority regards the local litigation requirement as toothless simply because the Treaty does not require an arbitrator to \xe2\x80\x9cgive substantive weight to the local court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations on the matters at issue between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9; see also ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, but instead provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both Parties,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 8(4), 1765 U. N. T. S. 38.  While it is true that an arbitrator need not defer to an Argentine court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in an investor dispute, that does not deprive the litigation requirement of practical import.  Most significant, the Treaty provides that an \xe2\x80\x9carbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 8(4), ibid.  I doubt that a tribunal would give no weight to an Argentine court\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative con-struction of Argentine law, rendered in the same dispute, just because it might not be formally bound to adopt that interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The local litigation requirement can also help to narrow the range of issues that remain in controversy by the time a dispute reaches arbitration.  It might even induce the parties to settle along the way.  And of course the investor might prevail, which could likewise obviate the need for arbitration.  Cf. McKart v. United States,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185,\n195 (1969)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        None of this should be interpreted as defending Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s history when it comes to international investment.  That history may prompt doubt that requiring an investor to resort to that country\xe2\x80\x99s courts in the first instance will be of any use.  But that is not the question.  Argentina and the United Kingdom reached agreement on the term at issue.  The question can therefore be rephrased as whether it makes sense for either Contracting Party to insist on resort to its courts before being compelled to arbitrate anywhere in the world before arbitrators not of its choosing.  The foregoing reasons may seem more compelling when viewed apart from the particular episode before us.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Given that the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement is a condition on consent to arbitrate, it follows that whether an investor has complied with that requirement is a question a court must decide de\xc2\xa0novo, rather than an issue for the arbitrator to decide subject only to the most deferential judicial review.  See, e.g., Adams v. Suozzi, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 220, 226\xe2\x80\x93228 (CA2 2005) (holding that compliance with a condition on formation of an arbitration agreement is for a court, rather than an arbitrator, to determine).  The logic is simple: Because an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority depends on the consent of the parties, the arbitrator should not as a rule be able to decide for himself whether the parties have in fact consented.  Where the consent of the parties is in question, \xe2\x80\x9creference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Howsam, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83\xe2\x80\x9384.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This principle is at the core of our arbitration precedents.  See Granite Rock Co., 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 299 (questions concerning \xe2\x80\x9cthe formation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x9d are for a court to decide de\xc2\xa0novo).  The same principle is also embedded in the law of international commercial arbitration.  2 Born 2792 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here one party denies ever having made an arbitration agreement or challenges the validity of any such agreement, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the possibility of de\xc2\xa0novo judicial review of any jurisdictional award in an annulment action is logically necessary\xe2\x80\x9d).

Draft No. 2, Apr. 16, 2012) (\xe2\x80\x9ca court determines de\xc2\xa0novo .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the existence of the arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, the question in this case\xe2\x80\x94whether BG Group accepted the terms of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s offer to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x94presents an issue of contract formation, which is the starkest form of the question whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate.  In Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., we gave two examples of questions going to consent, which are for courts to decide: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 84.  In both examples, there is at least a putative arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute.  The only question is whether the agreement is truly binding or whether it covers the specific dispute.  Here, by contrast, the question is whether the arbitration clause in the Treaty between the United Kingdom and Argentina gives riseto an arbitration agreement between Argentina and BG Group at all.  Cf. ante, at 2 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cConsent is especially salient in the context of a bilateral investment treaty, where the treaty is not an already agreed-upon arbitration provision between known parties\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority never even starts down this path.  Instead, it preempts the whole inquiry by concluding that the local litigation requirement is the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural precondition\xe2\x80\x9d that parties typically expect an arbitrator to enforce.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But as explained, the local litigation requirement does not resemble the requirements we have previously deemed presumptively procedural.  See supra, at 8.  It does not merely regulate the timing of arbitration.  Nor does it send the parties to non-judicial forms of dispute resolution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        More importantly, all of the cases cited by the majority as examples of procedural provisions involve commercial contracts between two private parties.  See ante, at 9.  None of them\xe2\x80\x94not a single one\xe2\x80\x94involves an agreement between sovereigns or an agreement to which the person seeking to compel arbitration is not even a party.  The Treaty, of course, is both of those things.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority suggests that I am applying \xe2\x80\x9ca different kind of analysis\xe2\x80\x9d from that governing private commercial contracts, just because what is at issue is a treaty.  Ante, at 15.  That is not so: The key point, which the majority never addresses, is that there is no completed agreement whatsoever between Argentina and BG Group.  An agreement must be formed, and whether that has happened is\xe2\x80\x94as it is in the private commercial contract context\xe2\x80\x94an issue for a court to decide.  See supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The distinction between questions concerning consent to arbitrate and mere procedural requirements under an existing arbitration agreement can at times seem elusive.  Even the most mundane procedural requirement can be recast as a condition on consent as a matter of technical logic.  But it should be clear by now that the Treaty\xe2\x80\x99s local litigation requirement is not a mere formality\xe2\x80\x94not in Buenos Aires, not in London.  And while it is true that \xe2\x80\x9cparties often submit important matters to arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 11, our precedents presume that parties do not submit to arbitration the most important matter of all: whether they are subject to an agreement to arbitrate in the first place.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor has the majority pointed to evidence that would rebut this presumption by showing that Argentina \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clearly and unmistakably\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d intended to have an arbitrator en-force the litigation requirement.  Howsam, supra, at 83 (quoting AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 643,\n649 (1986)\n).  As the majority notes, ante, at 14, the Treaty incorporates certain arbitration rules that, in turn, authorize arbitrators to determine their own jurisdiction over a dispute.  See Art. 8(3).  But those rules do not operate until a dispute is properly before an arbitral tribunal, and of course the whole question in this case is whether the dispute between BG Group and Argentina was before the arbitrators, given BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the 18-month local litigation requirement.  As a leading treatise has explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the parties have not validly agreed to any arbitration agreement at all, then they also have necessarily not agreed to institutional arbitration rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Born 870.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn these circumstances, provisions in institutional rules cannot confer any [such] authority upon an arbitral tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I also see no reason to think that arbitrators enjoy comparative expertise in construing the local litigation requirement.  Ante, at 14.  It would be one thing if that provision involved the application of the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 own rules, cf. Howsam, supra, at 85, or if it were \xe2\x80\x9cintertwined\xe2\x80\x9d with the merits of the underlying dispute, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 376 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 557.  Neither is true of the litigation requirement.  A court can assess compliance with the requirement at least as well as an arbitrator can.  Given the structure of Article 8 and the important interests that the litigation requirement protects, it seems clear that the United Kingdom and Argentina thought the same.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the Court of Appeals got there by a slightly different route, it correctly concluded that a court must decide questions concerning the interpretation and application of the local litigation requirement de\xc2\xa0novo.  665 F.\xc2\xa03d 1363, 1371\xe2\x80\x931373 (CADC 2012).  At the same time, however, the court seems to have simply taken it for granted that, because BG Group did not submit its dispute to the local courts, the arbitral award in BG Group\xe2\x80\x99s favor was invalid.  Indeed, the court addressed the issue in a perfunctory paragraph at the end of its opinion and saw \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98only one possible outcome\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cthat BG Group was required to commence a lawsuit in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s courts and wait eighteen months before filing for arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.,at 1373 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662,\n677 (2010)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That conclusion is not obvious.  A leading treatise has indicated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is a necessary implication from [a uni-lateral] offer that the offeror, in addition, makes a sub-sidiary offer by which he or she promises to accept a tender of performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Lord \xc2\xa75:14, at 1005.  On this understanding, an offeree\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with an essential condition of the unilateral offer \xe2\x80\x9cwill not bar an action, if failure to comply with the condition is due to the offeror\xe2\x80\x99s own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1005\xe2\x80\x931006.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It would be open to BG Group to argue before the Court of Appeals that this principle was incorporated into Article 8(2)(a) as an implicit aspect of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral offer to arbitrate.  Such an argument would find some support in the background principle of customary international law that a foreign individual injured by a host country must ordinarily exhaust local remedies\xe2\x80\x94unless doing so would be \xe2\x80\x9cfutile.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dugan 347\xe2\x80\x93357.  In any event, the issue would be analyzed as one of contract formation, and therefore would be for the court to decide.  I would accordingly vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for such an inquiry.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0To be clear, the only question is whether BG Group formed an  agreement with Argentina.
