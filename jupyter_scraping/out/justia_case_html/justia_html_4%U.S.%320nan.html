On the 1st of August 1804, judgment was entered, by confession, at the suit of Ewing v. Murray, in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia county; in which the declaration was entitled of June term preceding. On the 3d of August 1804, judgment was entered, by confession, in the Supreme Court, against the same defendant, at the suit of Welsh, the present plaintiff; and the declaration was entitled as of March term preceding. </p><p> The question submitted was, which judgment was entitled to a priority of payment, from the proceeds of the sale of the defendant\'s real estate? </p><p> Wallace, on behalf of Welsh, the present plaintiff, contended, that the Supreme Court judgment, though, in fact, last entered, had a legal relation to March term; and must be preferred to the Common Pleas judgment, which related only to June term. He cited authorities to show the relation at common law: 14 Vin. Abr. 616. 12 Mod. 519. 3 Bl. Com. 420. 6 Mod. 191. Relv. 35. 3 Burr. 1596. 1 Wils. 39. 2 Saund. 9. And he argued, that neither the English statute of frauds, nor the Pennsylvania act of assembly, affected the legal relation of a judgment, except only in the case of bon a fide purchasers; not in the case of conflicting judgments. 3 P.
