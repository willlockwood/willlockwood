We enacted such a Bill of Rights for the Philippines and when it came for review here this Court said: </p><ul>\'When Congress came to pass the act of July 1, 1902, it enacted, almost in the language of the President\'s instructions, the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. In view of the expressed declaration of the President, followed by the action of Congress, both adopting, with little alteration, the provisions of the Bill of Rights, there would seem to be no room for argument that in this form it was intended to carry to the Philippine Islands those principles of our Government which the President <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="937">Page 406 U.S. 935 , 937</a></p><p> declared to be established as rules of law for the maintenance of individual freedom, at the same time expressing regret that the inhabitants of the islands had not theretofore enjoyed their benefit.</p></ul> <ul>\'How can it be successfully maintained that these expressions of fundamental rights, which have been the subject of frequent adjudication in the courts of this country, and the maintenance of which has been ever deemed essential to our Government, could be used by Congress in any other sense than that which has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they were taken?\' Kepner v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/195/100/case.html#124">195 U.S. 100, 124</a>.</ul> <p> That is the approach we should take here. </p><p> Procedural due process, for example, may not be necessary before food unfit for human use is seized. See North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, <a href="/cases/federal/us/211/306/case.html">211 U.S. 306</a>. But barring the need for quick, expeditious action, the amenities of notice and hearing are required whether discharge from public employment be at issue, Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/551/case.html">350 U.S. 551</a>; denial of a tax exemption, Speiser v. Randall, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html">357 U.S. 513</a>; disqualification for unemployment compensation, Sherbert v. Verner, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html">374 U.S. 398</a>; or the termination of welfare benefits, Goldberg v. Kelly, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/254/case.html">397 U.S. 254</a>, 263-265. </p><p> The honor of this Nation, as well as the livelihood of this petitioner, is at stake here. We grant Panamanians a Bill of Rights and dishonor it. The imperialistic, colonial attitude of our administration in the Canal Zone is notorious. But the \'natives\' are entitled to the same due process which we grant our own citizens. </p><p> I see no reason why we should not reverse this judgment out of hand. The least we can do is to set the case for argument.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
