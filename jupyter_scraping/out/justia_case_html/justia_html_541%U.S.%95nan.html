Argued January 14, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 23, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Congress established the Central and South Florida Flood Control Project (Project) to address drainage and flood control problems in reclaimed portions of the Everglades.  Five Project elements are at issue here.  The first, the \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x9d canal, collects ground water and rainwater from an area that includes urban, agricultural, and residential development.  The second Project element, pump station \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x939,\xe2\x80\x9d moves water from the canal to the third element, an undeveloped wetland, \xe2\x80\x9cWCA\xe2\x80\x933,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a remnant of the original South Florida Everglades.  Petitioner, the Project\xe2\x80\x99s day-to-day operator (hereinafter District), impounds the water there to keep if from flowing into the ocean and to preserve wetlands habitat.  Absent such human intervention, the water would flow back to the canal and flood the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin\xe2\x80\x99s populated areas.  Such flow is prevented by levees, including the \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9333\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x9d levees at issue here.  The combined effect of L\xe2\x80\x9333, L\xe2\x80\x9337, C\xe2\x80\x9311, and S\xe2\x80\x939 is artificially to separate the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin from WCA\xe2\x80\x933, which would otherwise be a single wetland.  The Project has an environmental impact on wetland ecosystems.  Rain on the western side of L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337 falls into WCA\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x99s wetland ecosystem, but rain falling on the eastern side absorbs contaminants, including phosphorous from fertilizers, before entering the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal.  When that water is pumped across the levees, the phosphorus alters the WCA\xe2\x80\x933 ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s balance, stimulating the growth of algae and plants foreign to the Everglades.  Respondents (hereinafter Tribe) filed suit under the Clean Water Act (Act), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person\xe2\x80\x9d unless done in compliance with the Act, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71311(a).  Under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), dischargers must obtain permits limiting the type and quantity of pollutants they can release into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.  \xc2\xa71342.  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discharge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(12), and defines \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98point source\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cfrom which pollutants are or may be discharged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(14).  The Tribe claims that S\xe2\x80\x939 requires an NPDES permit because it moves phosphorus-laden water from C\xe2\x80\x9311 into WCA\xe2\x80\x933, but the District contends that S\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x99s operation does not constitute the \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of [a] pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  The District Court granted the Tribe summary judgment, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Both rested their holdings on the predicate determination that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are two distinct water bodies.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The case is remanded for further proceedings regarding the parties\xe2\x80\x99 factual dispute over whether C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are meaningfully distinct water bodies.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Each of three arguments advanced by the District and the Federal Government as <em>amicus </em>would, if accepted, lead to the conclusion that S\xe2\x80\x939 does not require an NPDES permit.  P.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the District\xe2\x80\x99s initial argument that the NPDES program covers a point source only when pollutants originate from that source and not when pollutants originating elsewhere merely pass through the point source.  The definition of a point source as a \xe2\x80\x9cconveyance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(14), makes plain that the point source need only convey the pollutant to navigable waters.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s examples of point sources\xe2\x80\x94pipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduits\xe2\x80\x94are objects that transport, but do not generate, pollutants.  And one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary goals was to impose NPDES permitting requirements on municipal wastewater treatment plants, which treat and discharge pollutants added to water by others.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Government contends that all water bodies that are navigable waters under the Act should be viewed unitarily for purposes of NPDES permitting.  Because the Act requires NPDES permits only when a pollutant is added to navigable waters, the Government contends that such permits are not required when water from one navigable body is discharged, unaltered, into another navigable body.  Despite the relevance of this \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d approach, neither the District nor the Government raised it before the Eleventh Circuit or in their briefs respecting certiorari, and this Court is unaware of any case that has examined the argument in its present form.  Thus, the Court declines to resolve the argument here.  However, because the judgment must be vacated in any event, the unitary waters argument will be open to the parties on remand.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The District and the Government believe that the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 impoundment area are not distinct water bodies, but are two hydrologically indistinguishable parts of a single water body.  The Tribe agrees that, if this is so, pumping water from one into the other cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caddition\xe2\x80\x9d of pollutants within the meaning of the Act, but it disputes the District\xe2\x80\x99s factual premise that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are one.  The parties also disagree about how the relationship between S\xe2\x80\x939 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 should be assessed.  This Court does not decide here whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s test is adequate for determining whether C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are distinct, because that court applied its test prematurely.  Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, but some factual issues remain unresolved here.  The District Court correctly characterized the flow through S\xe2\x80\x939 as nonnatural, and it appears that if S\xe2\x80\x939 were shut down, the water in the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal might for a brief time flow east, rather than west.  But the record also suggests that if S\xe2\x80\x939 were shut down, the area drained by C\xe2\x80\x9311 would flood, which might mean C\xe2\x80\x9311 would no longer be a distinct body of navigable water, but instead part of a larger water body extending over WCA\xe2\x80\x933 and the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin.  It also might call into question the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that S\xe2\x80\x939 is the cause in fact of phosphorous addition to WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  Nothing in the record suggests that the District Court considered these issues when it granted summary judgment.  If, after further development of the record, that court concludes that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are not meaningfully distinct water bodies, S\xe2\x80\x939 will not need an NPDES permit.

Respondents Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the Friends of the Everglades brought a citizen suit under the Clean Water Act contending that the pumping facility is required to obtain a discharge permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondents.  A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit rested their holdings on the predicate determination that the canal and reservoir are two distinct water bodies.  For the reasons explained below, we vacate and remand for further development of the factual record as to the accuracy of that determination.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Central and South Florida Flood Control Project (Project) consists of a vast array of levees, canals, pumps, and water impoundment areas in the land between south Florida\xe2\x80\x99s coastal hills and the Everglades.  Historically, that land was itself part of the Everglades, and its surface and groundwater flowed south in a uniform and unchanneled sheet.  Starting in the early 1900\xe2\x80\x99s, however, the State began to build canals to drain the wetlands and make them suitable for cultivation.  These canals proved to be a source of trouble; they lowered the water table, allowing salt water to intrude upon coastal wells, and they proved incapable of controlling flooding.  Congress established the Project in 1948 to address these problems.  It gave the United States Army Corps of Engineers the task of constructing a comprehensive network of levees, water storage areas, pumps, and canal improvements that would serve several simultaneous purposes, including flood protection, water conservation, and drainage.  These improvements fundamentally altered the hydrology of the Everglades, changing the natural sheet flow of ground and surface water.  The local sponsor and day-to-day operator of the Project is the South Florida Water Management District (District). </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Five discrete elements of the Project are at issue in this case.  One is a canal called \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9311.\xe2\x80\x9d  C\xe2\x80\x9311 collects groundwater and rainwater from a 104 square\xe2\x80\x93mile area in south central Broward County.  App. 110.  The area drained by C\xe2\x80\x9311 includes urban, agricultural, and residential development, and is home to 136,000 people.  At the western terminus of C\xe2\x80\x9311 is the second Project element at issue here: a large pump station known as \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x939.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the water level in C\xe2\x80\x9311 rises above a set level, S\xe2\x80\x939 begins operating and pumps water out of the canal.  The water does not travel far.  Sixty feet away, the pump station empties the water into a large undeveloped wetland area called \xe2\x80\x9cWCA\xe2\x80\x933,\xe2\x80\x9d the third element of the Project we consider here.  WCA\xe2\x80\x933 is the largest of several \xe2\x80\x9cwater conservation areas\xe2\x80\x9d that are remnants of the original South Florida Everglades.  The District impounds water in these areas to conserve fresh water that might otherwise flow directly to the ocean, and to preserve wetlands habitat.  <em>Id.,</em> at 112.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Using pump stations like S\xe2\x80\x939, the District maintains the water table in WCA\xe2\x80\x933 at a level significantly higher than that in the developed lands drained by the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal to the east.  Absent human intervention, that water would simply flow back east, where it would rejoin the waters of the canal and flood the populated areas of the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin.  That return flow is prevented, or, more accurately, slowed, by levees that hold back the surface waters of WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  Two of those levees, L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337, are the final two elements of the Project at issue here.  The combined effect of L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337, C\xe2\x80\x9311, and S\xe2\x80\x939 is artificially to separate the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin from WCA\xe2\x80\x933; left to nature, the two areas would be a single wetland covered in an undifferentiated body of surface and ground water flowing slowly southward.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the above description illustrates, the Project has wrought large-scale hydrologic and environmental change in South Florida, some deliberate and some accidental.  Its most obvious environmental impact has been the conversion of what were once wetlands into areas suitable for human use.  But the Project also has affected those areas that remain wetland ecosystems.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rain on the western side of the L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337 levees falls into the wetland ecosystem of WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  Rain on the eastern side of the levees, on the other hand, falls on agricultural, urban, and residential land.  Before it enters the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal, whether directly as surface runoff or indirectly as groundwater, that rainwater absorbs contaminants produced by human activities.  The water in C\xe2\x80\x9311 therefore differs chemically from that in WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  Of particular interest here, C\xe2\x80\x9311 water contains elevated levels of phosphorous, which is found in fertilizers used by farmers in the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin.  When water from C\xe2\x80\x9311 is pumped across the levees, the phosphorous it contains alters the balance of WCA\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem (which is naturally low in phosphorous) and stimulates the growth of algae and plants foreign to the Everglades ecosystem.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phosphorous-related impacts of the Project are well known and have received a great deal of attention from state and federal authorities for more than 20 years.  A number of initiatives are currently under way to reduce these impacts and thereby restore the ecological integrity of the Everglades.  Respondents Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the Friends of the Everglades (hereinafter simply Tribe), impatient with the pace of this progress, brought this Clean Water Act suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  They sought, among other things, to enjoin the operation of S\xe2\x80\x939 and, in turn, the conveyance of water from C\xe2\x80\x9311 into WCA\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the Clean Water Act (Act) in 1972.  Its stated objective was \xe2\x80\x9cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  86 Stat. 816, 33  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251.  To serve those ends, the Act prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person\xe2\x80\x9d unless done in compliance with some provision of the Act.  \xc2\xa71311(a).  The provision relevant to this case, \xc2\xa71342, establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or \xe2\x80\x9cNPDES.\xe2\x80\x9d  Generally speaking, the NPDES requires dischargers to obtain permits that place limits on the type and quantity of pollutants that can be released into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.  The Act defines the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discharge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(12).  A \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98point source,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a pipe, ditch, channel, or tunnel, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom which pollutants are or may be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(14).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Tribe, the District cannot operate S\xe2\x80\x939 without an NPDES permit because the pump station moves phosphorous-laden water from C\xe2\x80\x9311 into WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  The District does not dispute that phosphorous is a pollutant, or that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.  The question, it contends, is whether the operation of the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump constitutes the \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of [a] pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether S\xe2\x80\x939 requires an NPDES permit.  The District Court granted the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s motion, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn this case an addition of pollutants exists because undisputedly water containing pollutants is being discharged through S\xe2\x80\x939 from C\xe2\x80\x9311 waters into the Everglades, both of which are separate bodies of United States water with . . . different quality levels.  They are two separate bodies of water because the transfer of water or its contents from C\xe2\x80\x9311 into the Everglades would not occur naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a\xe2\x80\x9329a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It reasoned first that \xe2\x80\x9cin determining whether pollutants are added to navigable waters for purposes of the [Act], the receiving body of water is the relevant body of navigable water.\xe2\x80\x9d  280 F.\xc2\xa03d 1364, 1368 (CA11 2002).  After concluding that pollutants were indeed being added to WCA\xe2\x80\x933, the court then asked whether that addition of pollutants was from a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source,\xe2\x80\x9d so as to trigger the NPDES permitting requirement.  To answer that question, it explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or an addition of pollutants to be from a point source, the relevant inquiry is whether\xe2\x80\x94but for the point source\xe2\x80\x94the pollutants would have been added to the receiving body of water.  We, therefore, conclude that an addition from a point source occurs if a point source is the cause in fact of the release of pollutants into navigable waters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a point source changes the natural flow of a body of water which contains pollutants and causes that water to flow into another distinct body of navigable water into which it would not have otherwise flowed, that point source is the cause-in-fact of the discharge of pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBecause it believed that the water in the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal would not flow into WCA\xe2\x80\x933 without the operation of the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station, the Court of Appeals concluded that S\xe2\x80\x939 was the cause-in-fact of the addition of pollutants to WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  It accordingly affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment, and held that the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station requires an NPDES permit.  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/957/index.html">539 U. S. 957</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District and the Federal Government, as <em>amicus</em>, advance three separate arguments, any of which would, if accepted, lead to the conclusion that the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station does not require a point source discharge permit under the NPDES program.  Two of these arguments involve the application of disputed contentions of law to agreed-upon facts, while the third involves the application of agreed-upon law to disputed facts.  For reasons explained below, we decline at this time to resolve all of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 legal disagreements, and instead remand for further proceedings regarding their factual dispute.  </p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its opening brief on the merits, the District argued that the NPDES program applies to a point source \xe2\x80\x9conly when a pollutant originates from the point source,\xe2\x80\x9d and not when pollutants originating elsewhere merely pass through the point source.  Brief for Petitioner 20.  This argument mirrors the question presented in the District\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the pumping of water by a state water management agency that adds nothing to the water being pumped constitutes an \xe2\x80\x98addition\xe2\x80\x99 of a pollutant \xe2\x80\x98from\xe2\x80\x99 a point source triggering the need for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit under the Clean Water Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Although the Government rejects the District\xe2\x80\x99s legal position, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21, it and the Tribe agree with the factual proposition that S\xe2\x80\x939 does not itself add any pollutants to the water it conveys into WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This initial argument is untenable, and even the District appears to have abandoned it in its reply brief.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 2.  A point source is, by definition, a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscernible, confined, and discrete <em>conveyance</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(14) (emphasis added).  That definition makes plain that a point source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only convey the pollutant to \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d which are, in turn, defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(7).  Tellingly, the examples of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint sources\xe2\x80\x9d listed by the Act include pipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduits, objects that do not themselves generate pollutants but merely transport them.  \xc2\xa71362(14).  In addition, one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary goals was to impose NPDES permitting requirements on municipal wastewater treatment plants.  See, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71311(b)(1)(B) (establishing a compliance schedule for publicly owned treatment works).  But under the District\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Act, the NPDES program would not cover such plants, because they treat and discharge pollutants added to water by others.  We therefore reject the District\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reading of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discharge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d contained in \xc2\xa71362(12).  That definition includes within its reach point sources that do not themselves generate pollutants.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having answered the precise question on which we granted certiorari, we turn to a second argument, advanced primarily by the Government as <em>amicus curiae </em>in merits briefing and at oral argument.  For purposes of determining whether there has been \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> the Government contends that all the water bodies that fall within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98navigable waters\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, all \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(7)) should be viewed unitarily for purposes of NPDES permitting requirements.  Because the Act requires NPDES permits only when there is an addition of a pollutant \xe2\x80\x9cto navigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach would lead to the conclusion that such permits are <em>not</em> required when water from one navigable water body is discharged, unaltered, into another navigable water body.  That would be true even if one water body were polluted and the other pristine, and the two would not otherwise mix.  See <em>Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York</em>, 273 F. 3d 481, 492 (CA2 2001); <em>Dubois</em> v. <em>United States Dept. of Agriculture</em>, 102 F.\xc2\xa03d 1273 (CA1 1996).  Under this \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d approach, the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station would not need an NPDES permit.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d argument focuses on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a pollutant discharge as \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(12).  The Government contends that the absence of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d prior to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71362(12) signals Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that NPDES permits would not be required for pollution caused by the engineered transfer of one \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable water\xe2\x80\x9d into another.  It argues that Congress intended that such pollution instead would be addressed through local nonpoint source pollution programs.  Section 1314(f)(2(F), which concerns nonpoint sources, directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to give States information on the evaluation and control of \xe2\x80\x9cpollution resulting from . . . changes in the movement, flow, or circulation of any navigable waters or ground waters, including changes caused by the construction of dams, levees, channels, causeways, or flow diversion facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note, however, that \xc2\xa71314(f)(2)(F) does not explicitly exempt nonpoint pollution sources from the NPDES program if they <em>also </em>fall within the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  And several NPDES provisions might be read to suggest a view contrary to the unitary waters approach.  For example, under the Act, a State may set individualized ambient water quality standards by taking into consideration \xe2\x80\x9cthe designated uses of the navigable waters involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71313(c)(2)(A).  Those water quality standards, in turn, directly affect local NPDES permits; if standard permit conditions fail to achieve the water quality goals for a given water body, the State must determine the total pollutant load that the water body can sustain and then allocate that load among the permit-holders who discharge to the water body.  \xc2\xa71313(d).  This approach suggests that the Act protects individual water bodies as well as the \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d as a whole.     </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also suggests that we adopt the \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d approach out of deference to a longstanding EPA view that the process of \xe2\x80\x9ctransporting, impounding, and releasing navigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98addition\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of pollutants to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16.  But the Government does not identify any administrative documents in which EPA has espoused that position.  Indeed, an <em>amicus </em>brief filed by several former EPA officials argues that the agency once reached the opposite conclusion.  See Brief for Former Administrator Carol M. Browner et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17 (citing <em>In\xc2\xa0re Riverside Irrigation Dist.</em>, 1975 WL 23864 (Off. Gen. Couns., June 27, 1975) (irrigation ditches that discharge to navigable waters require NPDES permits even if they themselves qualify as navigable waters)).  The \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d approach could also conflict with current NPDES regulations.  For example, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7122.45(g)(4) (2003) allows an industrial water user to obtain \xe2\x80\x9cintake credit\xe2\x80\x9d for pollutants present in water that it withdraws from navigable waters.  When the permit holder discharges the water after use, it does not have to remove pollutants that were in the water before it was withdrawn.  There is a caveat, however: EPA extends such credit \xe2\x80\x9conly if the discharger demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the discharge is made.\xe2\x80\x9d  The NPDES program thus appears to address the movement of pollutants among water bodies, at least at times.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government and numerous <em>amici</em> warn that affirming the Court of Appeals in this case would have significant practical consequences.  If we read the Clean Water Act to require an NPDES permit for every engineered diversion of one navigable water into another, thousands of new permits might have to be issued, particularly by western States, whose water supply networks often rely on engineered transfers among various natural water bodies.  See<em> </em>Brief for Colorado et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2\xe2\x80\x934.  Many of those diversions might also require expensive treatment to meet water quality criteria.  It may be that construing the NPDES program to cover such transfers would therefore raise the costs of water distribution prohibitively, and violate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 specific instruction that \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired\xe2\x80\x9d by the Act.  \xc2\xa71251(g).  On the other hand, it may be that such permitting authority is necessary to protect water quality, and that the States or EPA could control regulatory costs by issuing general permits to point sources associated with water distribution programs.  See<em> </em>40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7122.28, 123.25 (2003).*<footcall num="*">  Indeed, that is the position of the one State that <em>has </em>interpreted the Act to cover interbasin water transfers.

But despite its relevance here, neither the District nor the Government raised the unitary waters approach before the Court of Appeals or in their briefs respecting the petition for certiorari.  (The District adopted the position as its own in its reply brief on the merits.)  Indeed, we are not aware of any reported case that examines the unitary waters argument in precisely the form that the Government now presents it.  As a result, we decline to resolve it here.  Because we find it necessary to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to a third argument presented by the District, the unitary waters argument will be open to the parties on remand. </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the courts below, as here, the District contended that the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 impoundment area are not distinct water bodies at all, but instead are two hydrologically indistinguishable parts of a single water body.  The Government agrees with the District on this point, claiming that because the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 \xe2\x80\x9cshare a unique, intimately related, hydrological association,\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9ccan appropriately be viewed, for purposes of Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, as parts of a single body of water.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in Opposition 13.  The Tribe does not dispute that if C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are simply two parts of the same water body, pumping water from one into the other cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caddition\xe2\x80\x9d of pollutants.  As the Second Circuit put it in <em>Trout Unlimited</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above the pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not \xe2\x80\x98added\xe2\x80\x99 soup or anything else to the pot.\xe2\x80\x9d  273 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 492.  What the Tribe disputes is the accuracy of the District\xe2\x80\x99s factual premise; according to the Tribe, C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are two pots of soup, not one.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record does contain information supporting the District\xe2\x80\x99s view of the facts.  Although C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are divided from one another by the L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337 levees, that line appears to be an uncertain one.  Because Everglades soil is extremely porous, water flows easily between ground and surface waters, so much so that \xe2\x80\x9c[g]round and surface waters are essentially the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d App. 111, 117.  C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933, of course, share a common underlying aquifer.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.  Moreover, the L\xe2\x80\x9333 and L\xe2\x80\x9337 levees continually leak, allowing water to escape from WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  This means not only that any boundary between C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 is indistinct, but also that there is some significant mingling of the two waters; the record reveals that even without use of the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station, water travels as both seepage and groundwater flow between the water conservation area and the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin.  App. 172, see also <em>id.,</em> at 37 (describing flow between C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 as \xe2\x80\x9ccyclical\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties also disagree about how the relationship between S\xe2\x80\x939 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 should be assessed.  At oral argument, counsel for the Tribe focused on the differing \xe2\x80\x9cbiological or ecosystem characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d of the respective waters, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43; see also Brief for Respondent Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida 6\xe2\x80\x937; Brief for Respondent Friends of the Everglades 18\xe2\x80\x9322, while counsel for the District emphasizes the close hydrological connections between the two.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>Brief for Petitioner 47.  Despite these disputes, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Tribe.  It applied a test that neither party defends; it determined that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are distinct \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the transfer of water or its contents from C\xe2\x80\x9311 into the Everglades would not occur naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit endorsed this test.  280 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1368.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not decide here whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s test is adequate for determining whether C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are distinct.  Instead, we hold only that the District Court applied its test prematurely.  Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact.  See <em>Celotex Corp.</em> v. <em>Catrett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/317/index.html">477 U. S. 317</a> (1986).  The record before us leads us to believe that some factual issues remain unresolved.  The District Court certainly was correct to characterize the flow through the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station as a non-natural one, propelled as it is by diesel-fired motors against the pull of gravity.  And it also appears true that if S\xe2\x80\x939 were shut down, the water in the C\xe2\x80\x9311 canal might for a brief time flow <em>east</em>, rather than west, as it now does.  But the effects of shutting down the pump might extend beyond that.  The limited record before us suggests that if S\xe2\x80\x939 were shut down, the area drained by C\xe2\x80\x9311 would flood quite quickly.  See<em> </em>280 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1366 (\xe2\x80\x9cWithout the operation of the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station, the populated western portion of Broward County would flood within days\xe2\x80\x9d).  That flooding might mean that C\xe2\x80\x9311 would no longer be a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct body of navigable water,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1368, but part of a larger water body extending over WCA\xe2\x80\x933 and the C\xe2\x80\x9311 basin.  It also might call into question the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that S\xe2\x80\x939 is the cause in fact of phosphorous addition to WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  Nothing in the record suggests that the District Court considered these issues when it granted summary judgment.  Indeed, in ordering later emergency relief from its own injunction against the operation of the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station, the court admitted that it had not previously understood that shutting down S\xe2\x80\x939 would \xe2\x80\x9cliterally ope[n] the flood gates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1371. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find that further development of the record is necessary to resolve the dispute over the validity of the distinction between C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933.  After reviewing the full record, it is possible that the District Court will conclude that C\xe2\x80\x9311 and WCA\xe2\x80\x933 are not meaningfully distinct water bodies.  If it does so, then the S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station will not need an NPDES permit.  In addition, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broader \xe2\x80\x9cunitary waters\xe2\x80\x9d argument is open to the District on remand.  Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*An applicant for an individual NPDES permit must provide informa-\ntion about, among other things, the point source itself, the nature of the pollutants to be discharged, and any water treatment system that will be used.

Once EPA or a state agency issues such a permit, covered entities, in some cases, need take no further action to achieve compliance with the NPDES besides adhering to the permit conditions.

In Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, the Court declines to resolve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s unitary-waters argument on the ground that it was not raised or decided below.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  In my judgment, a fair reading of the opinion and briefs does not support that contention.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 280 F.\xc2\xa03d 1364, 1368, n.\xc2\xa05 (CA11 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe reject the Water District\xe2\x80\x99s argument that no addition of pollutants can occur unless pollutants are added from the outside world <em>insofar as the Water District contends the outside world cannot include another body of navigable waters</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Brief for Appellant in No. 00\xe2\x80\x9315703\xe2\x80\x93CC (CA11), p. 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe S\xe2\x80\x939 pump station merely moves navigable waters from one side of the Levee to another\xe2\x80\x9d).

To my knowledge, that argument has not previously been made.
