Dart\xe2\x80\x99s notice of removal alleged that the purported underpayments totaled over $8.2 million.

In response, Dart submitted an executive\xe2\x80\x99s detailed declaration supporting an amount in controversy in excess of $11 million.  The District Court granted Owens\xe2\x80\x99 remand motion, reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself.  Dart petitioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal, see \xc2\xa71453(c)(1), but that court denied review and rehearing en banc. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        1.\xc2\xa0As specified in \xc2\xa71446(a), a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain evidentiary submissions.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        Section 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Similarly, the amount-in-controversy allegation of a defendant seeking federal-court adjudication should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.  In the event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, both sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied, see \xc2\xa71446(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in part, on a purported \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d against removal, but no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, a statute Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.

The case was \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d the Tenth Circuit because of Dart\xe2\x80\x99s application for leave to appeal, and the Court has jurisdiction to review what the Court of Appeals did with that application.

The Tenth Circuit had previously stated considerations bearing on the intelligent exercise of discretion under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1).  One of those considerations is particularly relevant here: a court of appeals should inquire whether, if a district court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order remains undisturbed, the case will \xe2\x80\x9cleave the ambit of the federal courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BP America, Inc. </i>v.<i> Oklahoma ex\xc2\xa0rel. Edmondson</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d 1029, 1035.  Thus the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 denial of review established the law\xe2\x80\x94the requirement of proof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice\xe2\x80\x94not simply for this case, but for future CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit, leaving those defendants with no realistic opportunity to resist making the evidentiary submission.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        The District Court, driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit precedent, erred in ruling that Dart\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy allegation failed for want of proof.  It was an abuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\xe2\x80\x99s request for review, for that disposition fastened on district courts within the Circuit an erroneous view of the law.  Contrary to the law the District Court derived from Tenth Circuit precedent, a removal notice need only plausibly allege, not detail proof of, the amount in controversy.Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-H">\n            \n        Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

S. C. \xc2\xa71446(a).  When re-moval is based on diversity of citizenship, an amount-in-controversy requirement must be met.  Ordinarily, \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d] the sum or value of $75,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(a).  In class actions for which the requirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed, \xc2\xa71332(d)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C), \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d]the sum or value of $5,000,000,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71332(d)(2).  If theplaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, filed in state court, demands mon-etary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if asserted ingood faith, is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to be the amount in controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71446(c)(2).  When the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint does not state the amount in controversy, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s notice of removal may do so.  \xc2\xa71446(c)(2)(A).</p><p>                    To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the removal notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite amount plausibly, or must the defendant incorporate into the notice of removal evidence supporting the allegation?  That is the single question argued here and below by the parties and the issue on which we granted review.  The answer, we hold, is supplied by the removal statute itself.  A statement \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain\xe2\x80\x9d need not contain evidentiary submissions.</p><p>I</p><p>                    Brandon W. Owens, plaintiff below and respondent here, filed a putative class action in Kansas state court alleging that defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company, LLC, and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC (collectively, Dart), underpaid royalties owed to putative class members under certain oil and gas leases.  The complaint sought \xe2\x80\x9ca fair and reasonable amount\xe2\x80\x9d to compensate putative class members for \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d they sustained due to the alleged underpayments.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a, 35a.</p><p>                    Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the District of Kansas.  CAFA gives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions, defined in \xc2\xa71332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100 members, the parties are minimally diverse, and the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.  \xc2\xa71332(d)(2), (5)(B); see <i>Standard Fire Ins. Co. </i>v.<i> Knowles</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).  Dart\xe2\x80\x99s notice of removal alleged that all three requirements were satisfied.  With respect to the amount in controversy, Dart stated that the purported underpayments to putative class members totaled more than $8.2 million.</p><p>                    Owens moved to remand the case to state court.  The notice of removal was \xe2\x80\x9cdeficient as a matter of law,\xe2\x80\x9dOwens asserted, because it included \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence\xe2\x80\x9d proving that the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a, 53a.  In response, Dart submitted a declaration by one of its executive officers.  The declaration included a detailed damages calculation indicating that the amount in controversy, <i>sans</i> interest, exceeded $11 million.  Without challenging Dart\xe2\x80\x99s calculation,Owens urged that Dart\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy submissioncame too late.  \xe2\x80\x9c[The] legally deficient [notice of removal],\xe2\x80\x9d Owens maintained, could not be cured by \xe2\x80\x9cpost-removal evidence about the amount in controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 100a.</p><p>                    Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof ofthe amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself, the District Court granted Owens\xe2\x80\x99 remand motion.  Dart\xe2\x80\x99sdeclaration, the District Court held, could not serve to keep the case in federal court.  The Tenth Circuit, as the District Court read Circuit precedent, \xe2\x80\x9chas consistently held that reference to factual allegations or evidence out-side of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted to determine the amount in controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet.for Cert. 26a, and n. 37 (citing <i>Laughlin </i>v.<i> Kmart Corp.</i>, 50 F.\xc2\xa03d 871, 873 (1995); <i>Martin </i>v.<i> Franklin Capital Corp.</i>, 251 F.\xc2\xa03d 1284, 1291, n.\xc2\xa04 (2001); <i>Oklahoma Farm Bureau Mut.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a\xe2\x80\x9314a.</p><p>                    An evenly divided court denied Dart\xe2\x80\x99s petition for en banc review.  Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit \xe2\x80\x9c[had] let stand a district-court decision that will in effect impose in this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are even more onerous than the code pleading requirements that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. federal courts abandoned long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d  730 F.\xc2\xa03d 1234 (2013).  The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant Dart\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged, because the opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto correct the law in our circuit\xe2\x80\x9d likely would not arise again.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1235.  Henceforth, Judge Hartz explained, \xe2\x80\x9cany diligent attorney .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a chance on remand to state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court requesting resolution of the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether a defendant seeking removal to federal court is required to include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the notice of removal, or is alleging the required \xe2\x80\x98short and plain statement of the grounds for removal\xe2\x80\x99 enough?\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.

By design, \xc2\xa71446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; J. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73733, pp. 639\xe2\x80\x93641 (4th ed. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 1446(a) requires only that the grounds for removal be stated in \xe2\x80\x98a short and plain statement\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94terms borrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).\xe2\x80\x9d).  The legislative history of \xc2\xa71446(a) is corroborative.  Congress, by borrowing the familiar \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement\xe2\x80\x9d standard from Rule 8(a), intended to \xe2\x80\x9csimplify the \xe2\x80\x98pleading\xe2\x80\x99 requirements for removal\xe2\x80\x9d and to clarify that courts should \xe2\x80\x9capply the same liberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to other matters of pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93889, p. 71 (1988).  See also <i>ibid. </i>(disapproving decisions requiring \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed pleading\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy allegation is accepted if made in good faith.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. </i>v.<i> Doyle</i>,429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 274,276 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) (quoting <i>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co.</i> v. <i>Red Cab Co.</i>,303 U.\xc2\xa0S. 283,288 (1938); alteration in original).  Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court adjudication, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.  Indeed, the Tenth Circuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demanding proof together with the removal notice, recognized that it was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and removing defendants differently with regard to the amount in controversy.  See <i>McPhail </i>v.<i> Deere &amp; Co.</i>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d 947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not by plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cbears no evident logical relationship either to the purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle that those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must establish its prerequisites\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    If the plaintiff contests the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegation, \xc2\xa71446(c)(2)(B) instructs: \xe2\x80\x9c[R]emoval .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is proper on the basis of an amount in controversy asserted\xe2\x80\x9d by the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cif the district court finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds\xe2\x80\x9d the jurisdictional threshold.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  This provision, added to \xc2\xa71446 as part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in order when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of the amount in controversy is challenged.  In such a case, both sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied.  As the House Judiciary Committee Report on the JVCA observed:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy requirement has been met.  Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert that the jurisdictional threshold has been met.  Discovery may be taken with regard to that question.  In case of a dispute, the district court must make findings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance standard applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 112\xe2\x80\x9310, p.\xc2\xa016 (2011).</p><p>Of course, a dispute about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional allegations cannot arise until <i>after</i> the defendant files a notice of removal containing those allegations.  Brief for Dart 14.</p><p>                    In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied, in part, on a purported \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d against removal.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Laughlin</i>, 50 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 873 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is a presumption against removal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d).  We need not here decide whether such a presumption is proper in mine-run diversity cases.

This case fits that bill.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>                    There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on the legally erroneous premise that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was correct.  In an earlier case, the Tenth Circuit, following the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s lead, stated considerations that it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of discretion under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1).  <i>BP America, Inc. </i>v.<i> Okla-homa ex\xc2\xa0rel. Edmondson</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d 1029, 1034\xe2\x80\x931035 (2010)(adopting factors set out in <i>College of Dental Surgeons of Puerto Rico </i>v.<i> Connecticut Gen. Life Ins.

Or, as phrased by the Tenth Circuit, if a district court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order remains undisturbed, will the case \xe2\x80\x9cleave the ambit of the federal courts for good, precluding any other opportunity for [the defendant] to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement [under CAFA] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BP America</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1035.  See also <i>Coffey </i>v.<i> Freeport McMoran Copper &amp; Gold</i>, 581 F.\xc2\xa03d 1240, 1247 (CA10 2009) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of \xc2\xa71453(c)(1) isto develop a body of appellate law interpreting CAFA\xe2\x80\x9d(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Thus, the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  That the Court of Appeals, instead, rejected Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal strongly suggests that the panel thought the District Court got it right in requiring proof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.</p><p>                    In practical effect, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 denial of review established the law not simply for this case, but for future CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit.  The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in which the Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule that both Owens and the District Court ascribed to decisions of the Court of Appeals: Defendants seeking to remove under CAFA must be sent back to state court unless they submit with the notice of removal evidence proving the alleged amount in controversy.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  On this point, Judge Hartz\xe2\x80\x99s observation, dissenting from the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of rehearing en banc, see <i>supra,</i> at 4, bears recounting in full:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter today\xe2\x80\x99s decision any diligent attorney (and one can assume that an attorney representing a defendant in a case involving at least $5 million\xe2\x80\x94the threshold for removal under CAFA\xe2\x80\x94would have substantial incentive to be diligent) would submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a chance on remand to state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  730 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1235.</p><p>With no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray, Judge Hartz anticipated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue will not arise again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Consequently, the law applied by the District Court\xe2\x80\x94demanding that the notice of removal contain evidence documenting the amount in controversy\xe2\x80\x94will be frozen in place for all venues within the Tenth Circuit.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>                    Recall that the Court of Appeals denied Dart\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon careful consideration of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, as well as the applicable law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.  What did the parties submit to the Tenth Circuit?  Their presentations urged conflicting views on whether a removing defendant must tender prima facie proof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal notice.  And what was \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicable law\xe2\x80\x9d other than the rule recited by the Tenth Circuit in <i>Laughlin</i> and follow-on decisions, <i>i.e.</i>, to remove successfully, a defendant must present with the notice of removal evidence proving the amount in controversy.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>                    From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Dart\xe2\x80\x99s request for review of the remand order was infected by legal error.  The District Court erred in ruling that Dart\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy allegation failed for want of proof, but that error was driven by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit precedent.  The parties trained their arguments in the Tenth Circuit, as they did here, on the question whether Dart could successfully remove without detailing in the removal notice evidence of the amount in controversy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by Owens\xe2\x80\x99 counsel that \xe2\x80\x9cthe issues .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provided to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Tenth Circuit were very similar to what you see in this Court, with the exception of [the question raised by Public Citizen] whether this Court has jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why the Tenth Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cowe[d] a duty to the bench and bar\xe2\x80\x9d to correct the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s misperception and to state as the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s law: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant seeking removal under CAFA need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its notice of removal and must prove that amount only if the plaintiff challenges the allegation.\xe2\x80\x9d  730 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1234, 1238.  In this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cautioned against casual rulings on applications like Dart\xe2\x80\x99s.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe decision whether to grant leave to appeal\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71453(c), the Tenth Circuit stressed, calls for the exercise of the reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s correctly \xe2\x80\x9c<i>informed </i>discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BP America</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p><p>                    Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his written submissions to this Court that anything other than the question presented accounts for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 disposition.  If Owens believed that the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of leave to appeal rested on some other ground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition or, at least, in his merits brief.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2; <i>Granite Rock Co.</i> v. <i>Teamsters</i>,561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287,306 (2010).  He said nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-pated that the question presented was ripe for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution.</p><p>                    In the above-described circumstances, we find it an abuse of discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dart\xe2\x80\x99s request for review.  Doing so froze the governing rule in the Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices, with no opportunity for defendants in Dart\xe2\x80\x99s position responsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.  That situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who did not think that the amount in controversy in diversity cases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by evidence, not merely credibly allege.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  And if the Circuit precedent on which the District Court relied misstated the law, as we hold it did, then the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order remanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by legal error.</p><p>                    Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues Public Citizen invites us to separate\xe2\x80\x94whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying review, and whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order was erroneous\xe2\x80\x94do not pose genuinely discrete questions.  Instead, resolution of both issues depends on the answer to the very same question: What must the removal notice contain?  If the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in effectively making the opposing view the law of the Circuit.  By the same token, the District Court erred in remanding the case for want of an evidentiary submission in the removal notice.  We no doubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order, see <i>supra,</i> at 8, and in doing so, to correct the erroneous view of the law the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision fastened on district courts within the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s domain.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    For the reasons stated, the judgment of the U.\xc2\xa0S.

In accordance with what it thought to be Tenth Circuit jurisprudence, the District Court interpreted this to require evidence (as opposed to mere allegations) supporting federal jurisdiction.  After finding that Dart\xe2\x80\x99s notice of removal did not include evidence of the jurisdictionally required amount in controversy, the District Court remanded the case to state court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a\xe2\x80\x9328a.  Dart sought permission to appeal this order under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca court of appeals <i>may</i> accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which it was removed\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  Without stating its reasons, the Tenth Circuit issued an order denying Dart\xe2\x80\x99s request.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.</p><p>                    Eager to correct what we suspected was the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s (and the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s) erroneous interpretation of \xc2\xa71446(a), we granted certiorari to decide whether no-tices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal jurisdiction.  After briefing we discovered a little snag: This case does not present that question.  Because we are reviewing the <i>Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s</i> judgment, the only question before us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order.  Once we found out that the issue presented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to review, the responsible course would have been to confess error and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.</p><p>                    The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the District Court erred in remanding this case to state court.  How can it do that, one might ask, when the only issue in this case concerns the propriety of the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal?  The Court hits upon a solution:  It concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the appeal <i>because it agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis</i>.  Attributing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning to the Tenth Circuit allows the Court to pretend to review the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s legal analysis.</p><p>                    There are problems with this approach that are, in a rational world, insuperable.  To begin with, the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s short order does not tell us why it decided not to hear Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  It <i>might </i>have done so for an impermissible reason\xe2\x80\x94for example, agreement with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s legal reasoning.  But it might instead have done so for countless other, permissible, reasons\xe2\x80\x94for example, a concern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the issue presented by Dart\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, or a concern  regarding the court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to quickly resolve the issue, see \xc2\xa71453(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (providing that appeals accepted under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1) must be decided within 60 days, absent consent of the parties, with a 10-day extension for \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause shown and in the interests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    Not long ago we held, unanimously, that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n appellate court should not presume that a district court intended an incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible of a correct reading, particularly when the applicable standard of review is deferential.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sprint/United Management Co.</i> v. <i>Mendelsohn</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379,386 (2008).   There, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely what the Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-tially) the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial of permission to appeal: presuming that the lower court adopted a legally erroneous argument advanced by one party.  <i>Id</i>., at 384\xe2\x80\x93385.

Today, however, this Court blatantly violates that rule.</p><p>                    The only \xe2\x80\x9cindication in the opinion\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court relies on is the following language from the order denying permission to appeal: \xe2\x80\x9cUpon careful consideration of [1] the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, as well as [2] the applicable law, the Petition [for permission to appeal the remand order] is denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a\xe2\x80\x9314a.  This, the Court tells us, means the Tenth Circuit <i>must have denied Dart\xe2\x80\x99s petition because it agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion</i>.  Of course it means no such thing.</p><p>                    As for point [1], c<i>onsidering</i> a submission is not the same thing as <i>agreeing </i>with that submission.  Worse still, correctness of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was not the only ground that Owens\xe2\x80\x99 brief in the Tenth Circuit urged to support denial of the petition for review.  It noted, for example, that the case addressed the general removal statute, \xc2\xa71446(a), and so did not involve a question unique to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA).  Response to Petition for Permission to Appeal in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93603, p.\xc2\xa03.  (The Tenth Circuit considers \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence of an important CAFA-related question\xe2\x80\x9d a reason to accept an appeal.  <i>BP America, Inc.</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson</i>, 613 F. 3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).)</p><p>                    As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe that the only \xe2\x80\x9capplicable law\xe2\x80\x9d the Tenth Circuit considered and relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>the law interpreting \xc2\xa71446(a).  After all, the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable law\xe2\x80\x9d surely includes the law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal, \xc2\xa71453(c)(1), and that body of law includes countless reasons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to the merits of the underlying district court judgment.  \xe2\x80\x9cApplicable law\xe2\x80\x9d would allow the Tenth Circuit, for example, to deny permission to appeal for reasons not mentioned in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefing.  It would allow it to deny permission because it would be unable to resolve the issue within 60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an extension).  \xc2\xa71453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F.\xc2\xa03d 1234, 1238 (Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt will always be tempting for very busy judges to deny review of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short order\xe2\x80\x9d).  And \xe2\x80\x9capplicable law\xe2\x80\x9d would permit numerous other grounds for denial, including those applied by this Court in denying petitions for certiorari.  There is, to tell the truth, absolutely nothing in the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s order to suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the Court eagerly attributes to it, rather than one of many possible lawful grounds.  Thus, as we said in <i>Mendelsohn</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be inappropriate for the reviewing court [us] to assume .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the lower court adopted a party\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect argument.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at 385, n.\xc2\xa02.                      </p><p>                    Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of the order, the Court makes one other attempt to demonstrate that the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s order was based upon its agreement with the holding of the District Court.  It asserts that denying Dart permission to appeal \xe2\x80\x9cfroz[e] in place\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  In light of that denial, the Court says, any \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible attorney\xe2\x80\x9d will include evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of removal, thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice held improper for the reason given by the District Court in this case.  As a result, the Tenth Circuit will likely never again be presented with the question whether evidence of jurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.  <i>Ibid</i>.  The Court then notes that, among the many factors the Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to accept an appeal under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1), is whether the case presents an issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will \xe2\x80\x9cleave the ambit of the federal courts for good.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BP America</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1035.  One would have thought that this factor, if it controlled the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s denial, means that the Tenth Circuit <i>did not agree with </i>the Court\xe2\x80\x99s perception that this issue will not likely reappear.  The Court, how-ever, says (quite illogically) that it means the TenthCircuit <i>must have</i> <i>agreed</i> with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect legal analysis.  It is hard to imagine a more obvious non sequitur.</p><p>                    And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts reality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth no \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible attorney\xe2\x80\x9d will fail to include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of removal.  Even discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys, but see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Maples</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), responsible attorneys, and even responsible judges, sometimes make mistakes, see, <i>e.g., </i>572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014) (order granting certiorari in this case).  Indeed, Dart\xe2\x80\x99s own (seemingly responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction, despite what they argue is Circuit precedent supporting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit precedent).</p><p>                    Even in the legal utopia imagined by the Court\xe2\x80\x94a world in which all lawyers are responsible and no lawyers make mistakes\xe2\x80\x94it is easy to imagine ways in which the issue could come back to the circuit court.  If, for example, a party appealed a district court decision addressing the sufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence, the Tenth Circuit could accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if necessary) that no evidence is required at all.  In short, it is impos-sible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that the chances of this issue arising again were \xe2\x80\x9cslim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.</p><p>                    The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an unprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doctrine.  Owens, it says, by failing to brief the argument that the Tenth Circuit denied Dart\xe2\x80\x99s petition for reasons other than its agreement with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, waived that argument.  <i>Ante, </i>at 12 (citing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2).  Dart, however, never made an argument that would have called for such a response.  It never argued that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying permission to appeal.  Aside from one stray assertion on the final page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely on whether the <i>District Court</i> erred in remanding the case to state court.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Petitioners 9 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court should reverse the district court\xe2\x80\x99s order remanding the case to state court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather than hold Dart responsible for failing to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, see <i>Republic of Argentina</i> v. <i>NML Capital,Ltd.</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (2014) (slip op., at 5, n.\xc2\xa02) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief\xe2\x80\x9d), theCourt makes the argument on Dart\xe2\x80\x99s behalf and then takes Owens to task for failing to refute it.  This Court ought not embrace such an oddhanded application of waiver principles.</p><p>                    The Court answers that Dart \xe2\x80\x9chad no cause to address\xe2\x80\x9d whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion until the issue was raised in Public Citizen\xe2\x80\x99s <i>amicus</i> brief.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9, n. 3.  Not good enough.  First, parties always have \xe2\x80\x9ccause to address\xe2\x80\x9d issues on which their entitlement to relief depends.  Second, and more important, Public Citizen filed its <i>amicus</i> brief after <i>both sides</i> had already filed their merits briefs.  So if the timing of that brief excuses Dart\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, it should excuse Owens\xe2\x80\x99 failure as well.</p><p>                    I come, finally, to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s stinging observation that I joined the majority opinion in <i>Standard Fire Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Knowles</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013)\xe2\x80\x94a case that arose in the same posture as this one, but that was resolved without reference to the question whether the appellate court abused its discretion.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8, n. 2.  Of course <i>Knowles </i>did not address whether denials of permission to appeal under \xc2\xa71453(c)(1) are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x94which is why today\xe2\x80\x99s majority cannot cite it as precedent.  See <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619\xe2\x80\x93631 (1993).  As for my own culpability in overlooking the issue, I must accept that and will take it with me to the grave.  But its irrelevance to my vote in the present case has been well expressed by Justice Jackson, in a passage quoted by the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion: \xe2\x80\x9cI see no reason why I should be consciously wrong today because I was unconsciously wrong yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>United States</i>,333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 611\xe2\x80\x93640 (1948) (dissenting opinion), quoted in <i>Burwell</i> v. <i>Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa011 (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 11) (Ginsburg J., dissenting).</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    Instead of correcting an erroneous district court opinion at the expense of an erroneous Supreme Court opinion, I would have dismissed this case as improvidently granted.  Failing that, my vote is to affirm the Court of Appeals, since we have absolutely no basis for concluding that it abused its discretion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3216645">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 13\xe2\x80\x93719</p><p>_________________</p><p>DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING COMPANY, LLC, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> BRANDON W.

I write only to point out another, more fundamental, defect in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition: We lack jurisdiction to review even the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 denial of permission to appeal.</p><p>                    Congress has granted this Court jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases in the courts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d by writ of certiorari.28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254.  Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of jurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the Court of Appeals to deny an application for permission to appeal a remand order.  But such an application is not a case: It \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d on the other side.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller-El </i>v.<i> Cockrell</i>,537 U. S. 322,355 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Hohn </i>v.<i> United States</i>,524 U. S. 236,256 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).</p><p>                    To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends an opinion of this Court holding that applications for certificates of appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas context are \xe2\x80\x9ccases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hohn</i>, <i>supra</i>.  <i>Hohn</i> was wrongly decided, and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s uncritical extension of its holding only compounds the error.  <i>Hohn</i> rests tenuously on the conclusion that the determination that must be made on an application for a COA is more like a threshold determination than a separate judicial proceeding.  See <i>id.</i>, at 246\xe2\x80\x93248.  The basis for that conclusion, if any exists, must rest on features unique to the COA: \xe2\x80\x9cThe COA determination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>requires</i> an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller-El</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 336 (emphasis added).  The best argument one could make in favor of <i>Hohn </i>is that, because a court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on an application for a COA turns on the strength of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s grievance and his entitlement to relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of the underlying merits case.  See <i>Hohn</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 248.</p><p>                    No such osmosis could transform an application for permission to appeal a remand order into a \xe2\x80\x9ccase.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Justice Scalia explains, the decision whether to permit such an appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a remand order.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2 (dissenting opinion).  The application here is nothing more than a request for discretionary permission to seek review.  See <i>Miller-El</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 355 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Tenth Circuit having denied that permission, no \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d ever arrived \xe2\x80\x9cin the court of appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  I would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
