That charge included the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.  Before the start of deliberations, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court also presented the jury with a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of them.  Acquitting on some but not others was not an option.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could not reach a verdict.  The court inquired about the jury\xe2\x80\x99s progress on each offense.  The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide.  The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.  The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial.  When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder charges on double jeopardy grounds.  The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on charges of capital murder and first-degree murder.

Blueford contends that the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.  But the report was not a final resolution of anything.  When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations had not yet concluded.  The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital and first-degree murder as deliberations continued.  The foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses.  That same lack of finality undermines Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Green v. United States, \n\n355 U.\xc2\xa0S. 184\n, and Price v. Georgia, \n\n398 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323\n.  In both of those cases, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report of the foreperson was not.

A trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when \xe2\x80\x9cparticular circumstances manifest a necessity\xe2\x80\x9d to declare a mistrial.  Wade v. Hunter, \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 684\n.  Blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree murder, given the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges.  According to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken some action, whether through new partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.  Blueford acknowledges, however, that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s reason for declaring a mistrial here\xe2\x80\x94that the jury was unable to reach a verdict\xe2\x80\x94has long been considered the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic basis\xe2\x80\x9d establishing necessity for doing so.  Arizona v. Washington, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497\n.  And this Court has never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse\xe2\x80\x95let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.  See Renico v. Lett, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  As permitted under Arkansas law, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s options in this case were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another option\xe2\x80\x94that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.

The Clause does not, however, bar a second trial if the first ended in a mistrial.  Before the jury concluded deliberations in this case, it re- ported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide.  The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.  The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial.  All agree that the defendant may be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide.  The question is whether he may also be retried on charges of capital and first-degree murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne-year-old Matthew McFadden, Jr., suffered a severe head injury on November 28, 2007, while home with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend, Alex Blueford.  Despite treatment at a hospital, McFadden died a few days later.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State of Arkansas charged Blueford with capital murder, but waived the death penalty.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s theory at trial was that Blueford had injured McFadden intentionally, causing the boy\xe2\x80\x99s death \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x93101(a)(9)(A) (Supp. 2011).  The defense, in contrast, portrayed the death as the re- sult of Blueford accidentally knocking McFadden onto the ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court instructed the jury that the charge of capital murder included three lesser offenses: first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.  In addition to describing these offenses, the court addressed the order in which the jury was to consider them: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of manslaughter.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then con- sider the charge of negligent homicide.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 51\xe2\x80\x9352.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe prosecution commented on these instructions in its closing argument.  It told the jury, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 55.  The prosecution explained that this was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a situation where you just lay everything out here and say, well, we have four choices.  Which one does it fit the most?\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 59.  Rather, the prose- cution emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cunless all 12 of you agree that this man\xe2\x80\x99s actions were not consistent with capital murder, then and only then would you go down to murder in the first degree.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the parties concluded their arguments, the court presented the jury with a set of five verdict forms, each representing a possible verdict.  There were four separate forms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged offenses: capital murder, first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.  A fifth form allowed the jury to return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford not guilty of any offense.  There was no form allowing the jury to acquit on some offenses but not others.  As stated in the court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, the jury could either \xe2\x80\x9cfind the defendant guilty of one of these offenses\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cacquit him outright.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 51.  Any verdict\xe2\x80\x94whether to convict on one or to acquit on all\xe2\x80\x94had to be unanimous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA few hours after beginning its deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happens if we cannot agree on a charge at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 62.  The court called the jury back into the courtroom and issued a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cAllen instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizing the importance of reaching a ver- dict.  See Allen v. United States, \n\n164 U.\xc2\xa0S. 492\n\xe2\x80\x93502 (1896).  The jury then deliberated for a half hour more before sending out a second note, stating that it \xe2\x80\x9ccannot agree on any one charge in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 64.  When the court summoned the jury again, the jury foreperson reported that the jury was \xe2\x80\x9chopelessly\xe2\x80\x9d deadlocked.  Ibid.

The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.  According to the State Supreme Court, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report had no effect on the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to retry Blueford, because the foreperson \xe2\x80\x9cwas not making a formal announcement of acquittal\xe2\x80\x9d when she disclosed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s votes.  2011 Ark. 8, p.\xc2\xa09, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d ___, ___.

Quoting from our decision in Martin Linen, supra, at 571, Blueford contends that despite the absence of a formal verdict, a jury\xe2\x80\x99s announcement constitutes an acquittal if it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actu- ally represents a resolution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21.  Here, according to Blueford, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous votes on capital and first-degree murder represented just that: a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe disagree.  The foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report was not a final resolution of anything.  When the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations had not yet concluded.  The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further, even after the foreperson had delivered her report.  When they emerged a half hour later, the foreperson stated only that they were unable to reach a verdict.  She gave no indication whether it was still the case that all 12 jurors believed Blueford was not guilty of capital or first-degree murder, that 9 of them believed he was guilty of manslaughter, or that a vote had not been taken on negligent homicide.  The fact that deliberations continued after the report deprives that report of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal on the murder offenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBlueford maintains, however, that any possibility that the jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by the instructions given to the jury.  Those instructions, he contends, not only required the jury to consider the of- fenses in order, from greater to lesser, but also prevented it from transitioning from one offense to the next with- out unanimously\xe2\x80\x94and definitively\xe2\x80\x94resolving the greater offense in his favor.  \xe2\x80\x9cA jury is presumed to follow its instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weeks v. Angelone, \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 225, \n234 (2000)\n.  So, Blueford says, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report that the jury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily establishes that the jury had acquitted Blueford of the greater offenses of capital and first-degree murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut even if we assume that the instructions required a unanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser offense\xe2\x80\x94as the State assumes for purposes of this case, see Brief for Respondent 25, n.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x94nothing in the instructions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote.  The instructions said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt on the charge of [the greater offense], you will [then] consider the charge of [the lesser offense].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  The jurors were never told that once they had a reasonable doubt, they could not rethink the issue.  The jury was free to reconsider a greater offense, even after considering a lesser one.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA simple example illustrates the point.  A jury enters the jury room, having just been given these instructions.  The foreperson decides that it would make sense to determine the extent of the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 agreement before discussions begin.  Accordingly, she conducts a vote on capital murder, and everyone votes against guilt.  She does the same for first-degree murder, and again, everyone votes against guilt.  She then calls for a vote on manslaughter, and there is disagreement.  Only then do the jurors en- gage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime.  While considering the arguments of the other jurors on how the death was caused, one of the jurors starts rethinking his own stance on a greater offense.  After reflecting on the evidence, he comes to believe that the defendant did knowingly cause the death\xe2\x80\x94satisfying the definition of first-degree murder.  At that point, nothing in the instructions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do: revisit a prior vote.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe very object of the jury system,\xe2\x80\x9d after all, \xe2\x80\x9cis to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  Allen, 164 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 501.  A single juror\xe2\x80\x99s change of mind is all it takes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt was therefore possible for Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s jury to revisit the offenses of capital and first-degree murder, notwithstanding its earlier votes.  And because of that possibility, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report prior to the end of deliberations lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses, quite apart from any requirement that a formal verdict be returned or judgment entered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat same lack of finality undermines Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Green v. United States, \n\n355 U.\xc2\xa0S. 184 (1957)\n, and Price v. Georgia, \n\n398 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323 (1970)\n.  In those cases, we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when a defendant, tried for a greater offense and convicted of a lesser included offense, is later retried for the greater offense.  See Green, supra, at 190; Price, supra, at 329.  Blueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case from Green and Price is that his case involves a deadlock on the lesser included offense, as opposed to a conviction.  In his view, that distinction only favors him, because the Double Jeopardy Clause should, if anything, afford greater protection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the lesser included offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBlueford\xe2\x80\x99s argument assumes, however, that the votes reported by the foreperson did not change, even though the jury deliberated further after that report.  That assumption is unjustified, because the reported votes were, for the reasons noted, not final.  Blueford thus overlooks the real distinction between the cases: In Green and Price, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report of the foreperson was not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBlueford maintains that even if the jury did not acquit him of capital and first-degree murder, a second trial on those offenses would nonetheless violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of a mistrial was improper.  Blueford acknowledges that a trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when \xe2\x80\x9cparticular circumstances manifest a necessity\xe2\x80\x9d to declare a mistrial.  Wade v. Hunter, \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 684, \n690 (1949)\n; see also United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824).  He also acknowledges that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s reason for declaring a mistrial here\xe2\x80\x94that the jury was unable to reach a verdict\xe2\x80\x94has long been con- sidered the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic basis\xe2\x80\x9d establishing such a necessity.  Arizona v. Washington, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497, \n509 (1978)\n.  Blueford therefore accepts that a second trial on manslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double jeopardy problem.  He contends, however, that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree murder, given the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges.  According to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken \xe2\x80\x9csome action,\xe2\x80\x9d whether through partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.

We have never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse\xe2\x80\x94let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.

The instructions explained those options in plain terms, and the verdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome.  There were separate forms to convict on each of the possible offenses, but there was only one form to acquit, and it was to acquit on all of them.  When the foreperson disclosed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s votes on capital and first-degree murder, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another option\xe2\x80\x94that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.

Ju-risdictions have different procedures respecting the announcement of verdicts and the entry of judgments, but that diversity has no constitutional significance.

Arkansas is a classic \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal-first\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chard-transition\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  See generally People v. Richardson, 184 P.\xc2\xa03d 755, 764, n.\xc2\xa07 (Colo. 2008).  Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 model jury instructions require a jury to complete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a lesser.  1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d ed. 1994).  As a matter of Arkansas law, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]efore it may consider any lesser-included offense, the jury must first determine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the greater offense.  Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit the defendant of the greater offense before considering his or her guilt on the lesser-included offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hughes v. State, 347 Ark. 696, 706\xe2\x80\x93707, 66 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 645, 651 (2002).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the trial judge instructed Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s jury to consider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of capital murder to the lesser included offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.  The judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only upon a unanimous finding of a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d as to that offense\xe2\x80\x94that is, upon an acquittal.  See In re Winship, \n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358, \n363 (1970)\n.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s closing arguments repeated this directive: \xe2\x80\x9c[B]efore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 55.  And the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s colloquy with the judge leaves no doubt that the jury understood the instructions to mandate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman reported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide because the jurors \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get past the manslaughter\xe2\x80\x9d count on which they were deadlocked.

The defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him.  When given the choice between finding him guilty of either first or second degree murder it chose the latter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see also Price, 398 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the greater charge\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  Notably, Green acknowledged that its finding of an \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit acquittal\xe2\x80\x9d was an \xe2\x80\x9cassumption,\xe2\x80\x9d because the jury had made no express statement with respect to the greater offense.  355 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190\xe2\x80\x93191.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBlueford\xe2\x80\x99s position is even stronger because his jury was not silent on the murder counts, but announced that it was \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous against\xe2\x80\x9d conviction.  And the trial judge specifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter only after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts.  Courts in several acquittal-first jurisdictions have held that a jury\xe2\x80\x99s deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies the assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater offenses.  See State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 283\xe2\x80\x93285, 773 A.\xc2\xa02d. 308, 323\xe2\x80\x93324 (2001); Stone v.

That assumption is not even necessary here because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority holds that the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was not an acquittal because it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not a final resolution of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the jury might have revisited its decisions on the murder counts during the 31 minutes of deliberations that followed the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.  We cannot know whether the jury did so, the majority reasons, because the jury was discharged without confirming that it remained \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous against\xe2\x80\x9d convicting Blueford of capital and first-degree murder.  Ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPutting to one side the lack of record evidence to support this speculation\xe2\x80\x94by far the more plausible inference is that the jurors spent those 31 minutes attempting to resolve their deadlock on manslaughter\xe2\x80\x94I do not agree that the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when its deliberations resumed.  \xe2\x80\x9cA verdict of acquittal on the issue of guilt or innocence is, of course, absolutely final.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bullington v. Missouri, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 430, \n445 (1981)\n.  The jury heard instructions and argument that it was required unanimously to acquit on capital and first-degree murder before it could reach manslaughter.  And as the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s colloquy makes plain, the jury followed those instructions scrupulously.  There is no reason to believe that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s vote was anything other than a verdict in substance\xe2\x80\x94that is, a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal collective decision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reached after full deliberation, consideration, and compromise among the individual jurors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harrison v. Gillespie, 640 F.\xc2\xa03d 888, 906 (CA9 2011) (en banc).  And when that decision was announced in open court, it became entitled to full double jeopardy protection.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Roth, 437 Mass. 777, 796, 776 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 437, 450\xe2\x80\x93451 (2002) (declining to give effect to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe verdict received from the lips of the foreman in open court\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9celevate form over substance\xe2\x80\x9d); Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511, 646 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 814\xe2\x80\x93815 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n determining what verdict, if any, a jury intended to return, the oral declaration of the jurors endorsing the result is the true return of the verdict\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also, e.g., Dixon v.

See ante, at 7.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s example, the jury has not announced its vote in open court.  Moreover, the  instructions in this case did not contemplate that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations could take the course that the majority imagines.  Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 model instruction requires acquittal as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and the Double Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to final-ity.  Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-first instruction is to ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater offense.  See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F.\xc2\xa02d 340, 346 (CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-first instruction avoids \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its duties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will move too quickly to the lesser\xe2\x80\x9d).  True, Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 instruction does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does not expressly permit reconsideration either.  In any event, nothing indicates that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s announced decisions were tentative, compromises, or mere steps en route to a final verdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant.  See Downum v. United States, \n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 734, \n738 (1963)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that the jury was not given the express option of acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant.  See ante, at 3, 9.  Arkansas law ascribes no significance to the presence of such options on a verdict form.  See Rowland v. State, 263 Ark. 77, 85, 562 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe jury may prepare and present its own form of verdict\xe2\x80\x9d).  The lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a judgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of an acquittal for constitutional purposes.  See Hudson v. Louisiana, \n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40, \n41, n. \n1 (1981)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s distinction of Green and Price is unavailing.  The majority observes that Green and Price, unlike this case, involved final decisions.  Ante, at 8.  As I have explained, I view the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s announcements of acquittal in this case as similarly final.  In any event, Green clarified that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim of former jeopardy\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot based on his previous conviction for second degree murder but instead on the original jury\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to convict him of first degree murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190, n.\xc2\xa011; accord, id., at 194, n.\xc2\xa014.  That is, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s silence on the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to justify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Id., at 191; see also Price, 398 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329.  In light of the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, this is an a\xc2\xa0fortiori case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an inquiry into the substance of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s jury had the option to convict him of capital and first-degree murder, but expressly declined to do so.  That ought to be the end of the matter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the majority were correct that the jury might have reconsidered an acquitted count\xe2\x80\x94a doubtful assumption for the reasons just explained\xe2\x80\x94that would not defeat Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim.  It \xe2\x80\x9chas been long established as an integral part of double jeopardy jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant could be put in jeopardy even in a prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an acquittal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crist v. Bretz, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 28, \n34 (1978)\n.  This rule evolved in response to the \xe2\x80\x9cabhorrent\xe2\x80\x9d practice under the Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and thereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s proof might be insufficient.  Washington, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 507; see, e.g., Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Case, 7 How. St. Tr. 79, 120 (1678).  Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is discharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant consents or there is a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d for the discharge.  Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins, 90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Perez, this Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d is a high bar: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 Wheat., at 580.  Since Perez, this Court has not relaxed the showing required.  See, e.g., Washington, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 506 (requiring a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98high degree\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of necessity); Downum, 372 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 736 (\xe2\x80\x9cimperious necessity\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, e.g., United States v. Coolidge, 25 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 622, 623 (No. 14,858) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary and striking circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  Before de-claring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh heavily a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant\xe2\x80\x99s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wade v. Hunter, \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 684, \n689 (1949)\n.  And in light of the historical abuses against which the Double Jeopardy Clause guards, a trial judge must tread with special care where a mistrial would \xe2\x80\x9chelp the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going badly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity to convict the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gori v. United States, \n\n367 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364, \n369 (1961)\n; see Green, 355 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA jury\xe2\x80\x99s genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes manifest necessity.  But in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, a jury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included offense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a de-fendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt or innocence on a greater\xe2\x80\x94it has acquit- ted on the greater.  Under Green, that is unquestionably true if the jury convicts on the lesser.  See id., at 189.  It would be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered less protection to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked on the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all.  See Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511\xe2\x80\x93512, n.\xc2\xa05, 646 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 815, n.\xc2\xa05. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires a trial judge, in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, to honor a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request for a partial verdict before declaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock.  Courts in acquittal-first jurisdictions have so held.  See, e.g., Tate, 256 Conn., at 285\xe2\x80\x93287, 773 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 324\xe2\x80\x93325; Whiteaker v. State, 808 P.\xc2\xa02d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991); Stone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 820; State v. Pugliese, 120 N.\xc2\xa0H. 728, 730, 422 A.\xc2\xa02d 1319, 1321 (1980) (per\xc2\xa0curiam); State v. Castrillo, 90 N.\xc2\xa0M. 608, 611, 566 P.\xc2\xa02d 1146, 1149 (1977); see also N.\xc2\xa0Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7310.70 (West 2002). Requiring a partial verdict in an acquittal-first jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction takes the bitter with the sweet.  In general, an acquittal-first instruction increases the likelihood of conviction on a greater offense.  See People v. Boettcher, 69 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 174, 182, 505 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 594, 597 (1987).  True, such an instruction may also result in deadlock on a greater, preventing a State \xe2\x80\x9cfrom obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge that would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus require the expense of a retrial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tsanas, 572 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 346.  But a State willing to incur that expense loses nothing by overcharging in an acquittal-first regime.  At worst, the State enjoys a second opportunity to convict, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the possibility that the earlier \xe2\x80\x98trial run\xe2\x80\x99 will strengthen the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crist, 437 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 52 (Powell, J., dissenting).  If a State wants the benefits of requiring a jury to acquit before compromising, it should not be permitted to deprive a defendant of the corresponding benefits of having been acquitted.  The Double Jeopardy Clause expressly prohibits that outcome.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority observes that we \xe2\x80\x9chave never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse\xe2\x80\x94let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10 (citing Renico v. Lett, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)).  That hands-off approach dilutes Perez beyond recognition.  This Court has never excused a trial judge from exercising \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulous\xe2\x80\x9d care before discharging a jury.  Jorn, 400 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 485 (plural-ity opinion).  Rather, we have insisted that a trial judge may not act \xe2\x80\x9cirrationally,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsibly,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprecipi-tately.\xe2\x80\x9d  Washington, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 514\xe2\x80\x93515.  Nor have we retreated from the rule that \xe2\x80\x9creviewing courts have an obligation to ensure themselves that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the trial judge exercised \xe2\x80\x98sound discretion\xe2\x80\x99 in declaring a mistrial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 514 (quoting Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the Double Jeopardy Clause did not compel that broader rule, the facts of this case confirm that there was no necessity, let alone manifest necessity, for a mistrial.  There was no reason for the judge not to have asked the jury, prior to discharge, whether it remained \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous against\xe2\x80\x9d conviction on capital and first-degree murder.  There would have been no intrusion on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberative process.  The judge was not required to issue new instructions or verdict forms, allow new arguments, direct further deliberations, or take any other action that might have threatened to coerce the jury.  Merely repeating his earlier question would have sufficed.  Because the judge failed to take even this modest step\xe2\x80\x94or indeed, to explore any alternatives to a mistrial, or even to make an on-the-record finding of manifest necessity\xe2\x80\x94I conclude that there was an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., id., at 486; see also Washington, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 525 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (manifest necessity requires showing \xe2\x80\x9cthat there were no meaningful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or that the trial court scrupulously considered available alter-natives and found all wanting but a termination of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the only reason I can divine for the judge\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take this modest step is his misperception of Arkansas law with respect to the transitional instruction.  After the colloquy with the forewoman, the judge commented at sidebar that the jurors \xe2\x80\x9chaven\xe2\x80\x99t even taken a vote on [negligent homicide].\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ve completed their deliberation.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. I mean, under any reasonable circumstances, they would at least take a vote on negligent homicide.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 65\xe2\x80\x9366.  And after the jury retired for the last half-hour of deliberations, the judge said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have an understanding of really that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get past every charge unanimously before they can move to the next charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 69.  That misstated Arkansas law as well as the judge\xe2\x80\x99s own instructions.  The jury was required to reach a unanimous decision on a greater offense before considering a lesser.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  In discharging the jury, the judge said, \xe2\x80\x9cMadam Foreman, there seems to be a lot of confusion on the part .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the jury about some of the instructions.  And because of the confusion and because of the timeliness and the amount of hours that has gone by without being able to reach a verdict, the Court is going to declare a mistrial.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 69\xe2\x80\x9370.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf, as these comments suggest, the judge wrongly believed that the jury was not required to reach unanimity on a greater offense before considering a lesser, then he accorded insufficient finality and weight to the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s earlier announcement of acquittal on capital and first-degree murder.  That mistake of law negates the deference due the judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision to declare a mistrial.  The judge explained that the jury was being discharged in part based on its \xe2\x80\x9cconfusion\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the instructions, when in fact, the confusion was the judge\xe2\x80\x99s.

For example, Dr. Adam Craig\xe2\x80\x94the medical examiner who autopsied the victim, Matthew McFadden, Jr., and whose testimony was essential to the State\xe2\x80\x99s theory of the crime\xe2\x80\x94was not board certified in anatomical pathology, hav-ing failed the certification examination five times.  Dr. Craig took only 2 slides of Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s brain, not the 10 to 20 called for by prevail-ing professional standards.

Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s expert pathologist, Dr. Robert Bux, testified that Dr. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s autopsy was inadequate to establish whether Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s death was accidental or intentional.  And Blue-ford\xe2\x80\x99s expert pediatrician, Dr. John Galaznik, testified that the State\xe2\x80\x99s theory\xe2\x80\x94that Blueford slammed Matthew into a mattress on the floor\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a likely cause\xe2\x80\x9d of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s injuries when assessed in view of current medical literature.

The major-ity resolves the question presented by determining that the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s announcements were not final, such that Blueford\xe2\x80\x99s jury did not necessarily deadlock on the lesser included offense of manslaughter.

In light of that determination, I do not read today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to express any view with respect to the requirements of the Double Jeopardy Clause where a jury does deadlock on a lesser in-cluded offense.
