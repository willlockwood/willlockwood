S. 517</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the personal immunity of federal officials in the Executive Branch from claims for damages arising from their violations of citizens\' constitutional rights.  Respondent [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] filed suit against a number of officials in the Department of Agriculture claiming that they had instituted an investigation and an administrative proceeding against him in retaliation for his criticism of that agency.  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that the individual defendants, as federal officials, were entitled to absolute immunity for all discretionary acts within the scope of their authority.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the defendants were entitled only to the qualified immunity available to their counterparts in state government.  <em>Economou v. U.S. Department of Agriculture,</em> 535 F.2d 688 (1976).  Because of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 438 U. S. 481</a></p><p> the importance of immunity doctrine to both the vindication of constitutional guarantees and the effective functioning of government, we granted certiorari.  429 U.S. 1089.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent controls Arthur N. Economou and Co., Inc., which was at one time registered with the Department of Agriculture as a commodity futures commission merchant.  Most of respondent\'s factual allegations in this lawsuit focus on an earlier administrative proceeding in which the Department of Agriculture sought to revoke or suspend the company\'s registration.  On February 19, 1970, following an audit, the Department of Agriculture issued an administrative complaint alleging that respondent, while a registered merchant, had willfully failed to maintain the minimum financial requirements prescribed by the Department.  After another audit, an amended complaint was issued on June 22, 1970.  A hearing was held before the Chief Hearing Examiner of the Department, who filed a recommendation sustaining the administrative complaint.  The Judicial Officer of the Department, to whom the Secretary had delegated his decisional authority in enforcement proceedings, affirmed the Chief Hearing Examiner\'s decision.  On respondent\'s petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the order of the Judicial Officer.  It reasoned that</p>\n<p>"the essential finding of willfulness . . . was made in a proceeding instituted without the customary warning letter, which the Judicial Officer conceded might well have resulted in prompt correction of the claimed insufficiencies."</p>\n<p><em>Economou v. U.S. Department of Agriculture,</em> 494 F.2d 519 (1974).</p>\n<p>While the administrative complaint was pending before the Judicial Officer, respondent filed this lawsuit in Federal District Court.  Respondent sought initially to enjoin the progress of the administrative proceeding, but he was unsuccessful in that regard.  On March 31, 1975, respondent filed a second </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 438 U. S. 482</a></p><p> amended complaint seeking damages.  Named as defendants were the individuals who had served as Secretary and Assistant Secretary of Agriculture during the relevant events; the Judicial Officer and Chief Hearing Examiner; several officials in the Commodity Exchange Authority; [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the Agriculture Department attorney who had prosecuted the enforcement proceeding; and several of the auditors who had investigated respondent or were witnesses against respondent. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint stated that, prior to the issuance of the administrative complaints, respondent had been "sharply critical of the staff and operations of Defendants, and carried on a vociferous campaign for the reform of Defendant Commodity Exchange Authority to obtain more effective regulation of commodity trading."  App. 157-158.  The complaint also stated that, some time prior to the issuance of the February 19 complaint, respondent and his company had ceased to engage in activities regulated by the defendants.  The complaint charged that each of the administrative complaints had been issued without the notice or warning required by law; that the defendants had furnished the complaints "to interested persons and others without furnishing respondent\'s answers as well"; and that, following the issuance of the amended complaint, the defendants had issued a "deceptive" press release that</p>\n<p>"falsely indicated to the public that [respondent\'s] financial resources had deteriorated when Defendants knew that their statement was untrue, and so acknowledge[d] previously that said assertion was untrue."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint then presented 10 "causes of action," some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 438 U. S. 483</a></p><p> of which purported to state claims for damages under the United States Constitution.  For example, the first "cause of action" alleged that respondent had been denied due process of law because the defendants had instituted unauthorized proceedings against him without proper notice and with the knowledge that respondent was no longer subject to their regulatory jurisdiction.  The third "cause of action" stated that, by means of such actions,</p>\n<p>"the Defendants discouraged and chilled the campaign of criticism [plaintiff] directed against them, and thereby deprived the [plaintiff] of [his] rights to free expression guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]"</p>\n<p>The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that, "as to the individual defendants, it is barred by the doctrine of official immunity. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 163.  The defendants relied on an affidavit submitted earlier in the litigation by the attorney who had prosecuted the original administrative complaint against respondent.  He stated that the Secretary of Agriculture had had no involvement with the case, and that each of the other named defendants had acted "within the course of his official duties."  <em>Id.</em> at 142-149.</p>\n<p>The District Court, apparently relying on the plurality opinion in <em>Barr v. Matteo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/564/case.html">360 U. S. 564</a></span> (1959), held that the individual defendants would be entitled to immunity if they could show that "their alleged unconstitutional acts were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 438 U. S. 484</a></p><p> within the outer perimeter of their authority, and discretionary."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a.  After examining the nature of the acts alleged in the complaint, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<p>"Since the individual defendants have shown that their alleged unconstitutional acts were both within the scope of their authority and discretionary, we dismiss the second amended complaint as to them. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 28a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court\'s judgment of dismissal with respect to the individual defendants.  <em>Economou v. U.S. Department of Agriculture,</em> 535 F.2d 688 (1976).  The Court of Appeals reasoned that <em>Barr v. Matteo, supra,</em> did not "represen[t] the last word in this evolving area," 535 F.2d at 691, because principles governing the immunity of officials of the Executive Branch had been elucidated in later decisions dealing with constitutional claims against state officials.  <em>E.g., Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967); <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html">416 U. S. 232</a></span> (1974); <em>Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U. S. 308</a></span> (1975).  These opinions were understood to establish that officials of the Executive Branch exercising discretionary functions did not need the protection of an absolute immunity from suit, but only a qualified immunity based on good faith and reasonable grounds.  The Court of Appeals rejected a proposed distinction between suits against state officials sued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and suits against federal officials under the Constitution, noting that</p>\n<p>"[o]ther circuits have also concluded that the Supreme Court\'s development of official immunity doctrine in \xc2\xa7 1983 suits against state officials applies with equal force to federal officers sued on a cause of action derived directly from the Constitution, since both types of suits serve the same function of protecting citizens against violations of their constitutional rights by government officials."</p>\n<p>535 F.2d at 695 n. 7.  The Court of Appeals recognized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 438 U. S. 485</a></p><p> that, under <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span> (1976), state prosecutors were entitled to absolute immunity from \xc2\xa7 1983 damages liability, but reasoned that Agriculture Department officials performing analogous functions did no require such an immunity, because their cases turned more on documentary proof than on the veracity of witnesses, and because their work did not generally involve the same constraints of time and information present in criminal cases.  535 F.2d at 696 n. 8.  The court concluded that all of the defendants were</p>\n<p>"adequately protected by permitting them to avail themselves of the defense of qualified \'good faith, reasonable grounds\' immunity of the type approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Scheuer</em> and <em>Wood.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 696.  After noting that summary judgment would be available to the defendants if there were no genuine factual issues for trial, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The single submission by the United States on behalf of petitioners is that all of the federal officials sued in this case are absolutely immune from any liability for damages, even if, in the course of enforcing the relevant statutes, they infringed respondent\'s constitutional rights, and even if the violation was knowing and deliberate.  Although the position is earnestly and ably presented by the United States, we are quite sure that it is unsound, and consequently reject it.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971), the victim of an arrest and search claimed to be violative of the Fourth Amendment brought suit for damages against the responsible federal agents.  Repeating the declaration in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

We held that a violation of the Fourth Amendment by federal agents gives rise to a cause of action for damages consequent upon the unconstitutional conduct.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Bivens</em> established that compensable injury to a constitutionally protected interest could be vindicated by a suit for damages invoking the general federal question jurisdiction of the federal courts, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] but we reserved the question whether the agents involved were "immune from liability by virtue of their official position," and remanded the case for that determination.  On remand, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, as has every other Court of Appeals that has faced the question, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] held that the agents were not absolutely immune, and that the public interest would be sufficiently protected by according the agents and their superiors a qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>In our view, the Courts of Appeals have reached sound results.

In that case, the acting director of an agency had been sued for malicious defamation by two employees whose suspension for misconduct he had announced in a press release.

S. 488</a></p><p> "matters committed by law to [the official\'s] control" and concluded, after an analysis of the specific circumstances, that the press release was within the "outer perimeter of [his] line of duty" and was "an appropriate exercise of the discretion which an officer of that rank must possess if the public service is to function effectively."  <em>Id.</em> at 575.  The plurality then held that under <em>Spalding v. Vilas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html">161 U. S. 483</a></span> (1896), the act was privileged and that the officer could not be held liable for the tort of defamation despite the allegations of malice. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>Barr</em> clearly held that a false and damaging publication, the issuance of which was otherwise within the official\'s authority, was not itself actionable, and would not become so by being issued maliciously.  The Court did not choose to discuss whether the director\'s privilege would be defeated by showing that he was without reasonable grounds for believing his release was true or that he knew that it was false, although the issue was in the case as it came from the Court of Appeals.

It did not address the liability of the acting director had his conduct not been within the outer limits of his duties, but, from the care with which the Court inquired into the scope of his authority, it may be inferred that, had the release been unauthorized, and surely if the issuance of press releases had been expressly forbidden by statute, the claim of absolute immunity would not have been upheld.  The inference is supported by the fact that MR. JUSTICE STEWART, although agreeing with the principles announced by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissented, and would have rejected the immunity claim because the press release, in his view, was not action in the line of duty.  360 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/564/case.html#592">360 U.

It is apparent also that a quite different question would have been presented had the officer ignored an express statutory or constitutional limitation on his authority.</p>\n<p><em>Barr</em> did not, therefore, purport to depart from the general rule, which long prevailed, that a federal official may not with impunity ignore the limitations which the controlling law has placed on his powers.  The immunity of federal executive officials began as a means of protecting them in the execution of their federal statutory duties from criminal or civil action based on state law.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html">Osborn v.

For example, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/170/case.html">Little v. Barreme,</a></span></em> 2 Cranch 170 (1804), held the commander of an American warship liable in damages for the seizure of a Danish cargo ship on the high seas.  Congress had directed the President to intercept any vessels reasonably suspected of being en route <em>to</em> a French port, but the President had authorized the seizure of suspected vessels whether going <em>to</em> or <em>from</em> French ports, and the Danish vessel seized was en route <em>from</em> a forbidden destination.  The Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, held that the President\'s instructions could not "change the nature of the transaction, or legalize an act which, without those instructions, would have been a plain trespass."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/170/case.html#179">6 U.

The relevant statute directed seizures of alcoholic beverages in Indian country, but the seizure at issue, which was made upon the orders of a superior, was not made in Indian country.

S. 483</a></span> (1896), on which the Government relies, the principal issue was whether the malicious motive of an officer would render him liable in damages for injury inflicted by his official act that otherwise was within the scope of his authority.  The Postmaster General was sued for circulating among the postmasters a notice that assertedly injured the reputation of the plaintiff and interfered with his contractual relationships.  The Court first inquired as to the Postmaster General\'s authority to issue the notice.  In doing so, it</p>\n<p>"recognize[d] a distinction between action taken by the head of a Department in reference to matters which are manifestly or palpably beyond his authority, and action having more or less connection with the general matters committed by law to his control or supervision."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#498">161 U. S. 498</a></span>.  Concluding that the circular issued by the Postmaster General "was not unauthorized by law, nor beyond the scope of his official duties," the Court then addressed the major question in the case -- whether the action could be "maintained because of the allegation that what the officer did was done maliciously?"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#493">161 U.

S. 493</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Spalding</em> made clear that a malicious intent will not subject a public officer to liability for performing his authorized duties as to which he would otherwise not be subject to damages liability. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  But <em>Spalding</em> did not involve conduct manifestly or otherwise beyond the authority of the official, nor did it involve a mistake of either law or fact in construing or applying the statute. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  It did not purport to immunize officials </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 438 U. S. 494</a></p><p> who ignore limitations on their authority imposed by law.  Although the "manifestly or palpably" standard for examining the reach of official power may have been suggested as a gloss on <em>Barreme, Bates, Kendall,</em> and <em>Wilkes,</em> none of those cases was overruled. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  It is also evident that <em>Spalding</em> presented no claim that the officer was liable in damages because he had acted in violation of a limitation placed upon his conduct by the United States Constitution.  If any inference is to be drawn from <em>Spalding</em> in any of these respects, it is that the official would not be excused from liability if he failed to observe obvious statutory or constitutional limitations on his powers or if his conduct was a manifestly erroneous application of the statute.</p>\n<p>Insofar as cases in this Court dealing with the immunity or privilege of federal officers are concerned, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] this is where the matter stood until <em>Barr v. Matteo.</em>  There, as we have set out above, immunity was granted even though the publication contained a factual error, which was not the case in <em>Spalding.</em>  The plurality opinion and judgment in <em>Barr</em> also appear --  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 438 U. S. 495</a></p><p> although without any discussion of the matter -- to have extended absolute immunity to an officer who was authorized to issue press releases, who was assumed to know that the press release he issued was false, and who therefore was deliberately misusing his authority.  Accepting this extension of immunity with respect to state tort claims, however, we are confident that <em>Barr</em> did not purport to protect an official who has not only committed a wrong under local law, but also violated those fundamental principles of fairness embodied in the Constitution. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Whatever level of protection from state interference is appropriate for federal officials executing their duties under federal law, it cannot be doubted that these officials, even when acting pursuant to congressional authorization, are subject to the restraints imposed by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>The liability of officials who have exceeded constitutional limits was not confronted in either <em>Barr</em> or <em>Spalding.</em>  Neither of those cases supports the Government\'s position.  Beyond that, however, neither case purported to abolish the liability of federal officers for actions manifestly beyond their line of duty; and if they are accountable when they stray beyond the plain limits of their statutory authority, it would be incongruous to hold that they may nevertheless willfully or knowingly violate constitutional rights without fear of liability.</p>\n<p>Although it is true that the Court has not dealt with this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 438 U. S. 496</a></p><p> issue with respect to federal officers, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] we have several times addressed the immunity of state officers when sued under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for alleged violations of constitutional rights.  These decisions are instructive for present purposes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967), decided that \xc2\xa7 1983 was not intended to abrogate the immunity of state judges which existed under the common law and which the Court had held applicable to federal judges in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html">Bradley v. Fisher,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 335 (1872).  <em>Pierson</em> also presented the issue</p>\n<p>"whether immunity was available to that segment of the executive branch of a state government that is . . . most frequently exposed to situations which can give rise to claims under \xc2\xa7 1983 -- the local police officer."</p>\n<p><em>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#244">416 U. S. 244</a></span>-245.  Relying on the common law, we held that police officers were entitled to a defense of "good faith and probable cause," even though an arrest might subsequently be proved to be unconstitutional.  We observed, however, that</p>\n<p>"[t]he common law has never granted police officers an absolute and unqualified immunity, and the officers in this case do not claim that they are entitled to one."</p>\n<p>386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html#555">386 U. S. 555</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra,</em> the issue was whether "higher officers of the executive branch" of state governments were immune from liability under \xc2\xa7 1983 for violations of constitutionally protected rights.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#246">416 U. S. 246</a></span>.  There, the Governor of a State, the senior and subordinate officers of the state National Guard, and a state university president had been sued on the allegation that they had suppressed a civil disturbance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 438 U. S. 497</a></p><p> in an unconstitutional manner.  We explained that the doctrine of official immunity from \xc2\xa7 1983 liability, although not constitutionally grounded and essentially a matter of statutory construction, was based on two mutually dependent rationales:</p>\n<p>"(1) the injustice, particularly in the absence of bad faith, of subjecting to liability an officer who is required, by the legal obligations of his position, to exercise discretion;( 2) the danger that the threat of such liability would deter his willingness to execute his office with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good."</p>\n<p>416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#240">416 U. S. 240</a></span>.  The opinion also recognized that executive branch officers must often act swiftly and on the basis of factual information supplied by others, constraints which become even more acute in the "atmosphere of confusion, ambiguity, and swiftly moving events" created by a civil disturbance.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#246">416 U.

Matteo,</em> [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] we did not believe that there was a need for absolute immunity from \xc2\xa7 1983 liability for these high-ranking state officials.  Rather the considerations discussed above indicated:</p>\n<p>"[I]n varying scope, a qualified immunity is available to officers of the executive branch of government, the variation being dependent upon the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office and all the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at the time of the action on which liability is sought to be based.  It is the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 438 U. S. 498</a></p><p> existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good faith belief, that affords a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct."</p>\n<p>416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#247">416 U. S. 247</a></span>-248.</p>\n<p>Subsequent decisions have applied the <em>Scheuer</em> standard in other contexts.  In <em>Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U. S. 308</a></span> (1975), school administrators were held entitled to claim a similar qualified immunity.  A school board member would lose his immunity from a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit only if</p>\n<p>"he knew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the student affected, or if he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury to the student."</p>\n<p>420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html#322">420 U. S. 322</a></span>.  In <em>O\'Connor v. Donaldson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/563/case.html">422 U. S. 563</a></span> (1975), we applied the same standard to the superintendent of a state hospital.  In <em>Procunier v. Navarette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/555/case.html">434 U. S. 555</a></span> (1978), we held that prison administrators would be adequately protected by the qualified immunity outlined in <em>Scheuer</em> and <em>Wood.</em>  We emphasized, however, that, at least in the absence of some showing of malice, an official would not be held liable in damages under \xc2\xa7 1983 unless the constitutional right he was alleged to have violated was "clearly established" at the time of the violation.</p>\n<p>None of these decisions with respect to state officials furnishes any support for the submission of the United States that federal officials are absolutely immune from liability for their constitutional transgressions.  On the contrary, with impressive unanimity, the Federal Courts of Appeals have concluded that federal officials should receive no greater degree of protection from <em>constitutional</em> claims than their counterparts in state government. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Subsequent to <em>Scheuer,</em> the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 438 U. S. 499</a></p><p> Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded that,</p>\n<p>"[a]lthough <em>Scheuer</em> involved a suit against state executive officers, the court\'s discussion of the qualified nature of executive immunity would appear to be equally applicable to federal executive officers."</p>\n<p><em>States Marine Lines v. Shultz,</em> 498 F.2d 1146, 1159 (1974).  In the view of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,</p>\n<p>"it would be \'incongruous and confusing, to say the least,\' to develop different standards of immunity for state officials sued under \xc2\xa7 1983 and federal officers sued on similar grounds under causes of action founded directly on the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Economou v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture,</em> 535 F.2d at 695 n. 7, quoting <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> 456 F.2d 1339, 1346-1347 (CA2 1972) (on remand). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has reasoned:</p>\n<p>"[Defendants] offer no significant reason for distinguishing, as far as the immunity doctrine is concerned, between litigation under \xc2\xa7 1983 against state officers and actions against federal officers alleging violation of constitutional rights under the general federal question statute.  In contrast, the practical advantage of having just <em>one</em> federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 438 U. S. 500</a></p><p> immunity doctrine for suits arising under federal law is self-evident.  Further, the rights at stake in a suit brought directly under the Bill of Rights are no less worthy of full protection than the constitutional and statutory rights protected by \xc2\xa7 1983."</p>\n<p><em>Mark v. Groff,</em> 521 F.2d 1376, 1380 (1975).  Other courts have reached similar conclusions.  <em>E.g., Apton v. Wilson,</em> 165 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 506 F.2d 83 (1974); <em>Brubaker v. King,</em> 505 F.2d 534 (CA7 1974); <em>see Weir v. Muller,</em> 527 F.2d 872 (CA5 1976); <em>Paton v. La Prade,</em> 524 F.2d 862 (CA3 1975); <em>Jones v. United States,</em> 536 F.2d 269 (CA8 1976); <em>G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States,</em> 560 F.2d 1011 (CA10 1977). [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>We agree with the perception of these courts that, in the absence of congressional direction to the contrary, there is no basis for according to federal officials a higher degree of immunity from liability when sued for a constitutional infringement as authorized by <em>Bivens</em> than is accorded state officials when sued for the identical violation under \xc2\xa7 1983.  The constitutional injuries made actionable by \xc2\xa7 1983 are of no greater magnitude than those for which federal officials may be responsible.  The pressures and uncertainties facing decisionmakers in state government are little, if at all, different from those affecting federal officials. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  We see no sense </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 438 U. S. 501</a></p><p> in holding a state governor liable but immunizing the head of a federal department; in holding the administrator of a federal hospital immune where the superintendent of a state hospital would be liable; in protecting the warden of a federal prison where the warden of a state prison would be vulnerable; or in distinguishing between state and federal police participating in the same investigation.  Surely, federal officials should enjoy no greater zone of protection when they violate <em>federal</em> constitutional rules than do <em>state</em> officers.</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the cases involving state officials are distinguishable because they reflect the need to preserve the effectiveness of the right of action authorized by \xc2\xa7 1983.  But as we discuss more fully below, the cause of action recognized in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971), would similarly be "drained of meaning" if federal officials were entitled to absolute immunity for their constitutional transgressions.  <em>Cf. Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#248">416 U. S. 248</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Government\'s analysis would place undue emphasis on the congressional origins of the cause of action in determining the level of immunity.  It has been observed more than once that the law of privilege as a defense to damages actions against officers of Government has "in large </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 438 U.

Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] -- the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1983 -- said nothing about immunity for state officials.  It mandated that any person who, under color of state law, subjected another to the deprivation of his constitutional right would be liable to the injured party in an action at law.

Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967); <em>Imbler v.

Rhodes, supra.</em>  The federal courts are equally competent to determine the appropriate level of immunity where the suit is a direct claim under the Federal Constitution against a federal officer.</p>\n<p>The presence or absence of congressional authorization for suits against federal officials is, of course, relevant to the question whether to infer a right of action for damages for a particular violation of the Constitution.  In <em>Bivens,</em> the Court noted the "absence of affirmative action by Congress," and therefore looked for "special factors counseling hesitation."  403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#396">403 U. S. 396</a></span>.  Absent congressional authorization, a court may also be impelled to think more carefully about whether the type of injury sustained by the plaintiff is normally compensable in damages, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U. S. 397</a></span>, and whether the courts are qualified to handle the types of questions raised by the plaintiff\'s claim, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#409">403 U. S. 409</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>But once this analysis is completed, there is no reason to return again to the absence of congressional authorization in resolving the question of immunity.  Having determined that the plaintiff is entitled to a remedy in damages for a constitutional violation, the court then must address how best to reconcile the plaintiff\'s right to compensation with the need to protect the decisionmaking processes of an executive department.  Since our decision in <em>Scheuer</em> was intended to guide the federal courts in resolving this tension in the myriad factual situations in which it might arise, we see no reason why it should not supply the governing principles for resolving this dilemma in the case of federal officials.  The Court\'s opinion in <em>Scheuer</em> relied on precedents dealing with federal, as well as state, officials, analyzed the issue of executive immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 438 U. S. 504</a></p><p> in terms of general policy considerations, and stated its conclusion, quoted <em>supra,</em> in the same universal terms.  The analysis presented in that case cannot be limited to actions against state officials.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, without congressional directions to the contrary, we deem it untenable to draw a distinction for purposes of immunity law between suits brought against state officials under \xc2\xa7 1983 and suits brought directly under the Constitution against federal officials.  The \xc2\xa7 1983 action was provided to vindicate federal constitutional rights.  That Congress decided, after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact legislation specifically requiring state officials to respond in federal court for their failures to observe the constitutional limitations on their powers is hardly a reason for excusing their federal counterparts for the identical constitutional transgressions.  To create a system in which the Bill of Rights monitors more closely the conduct of state officials than it does that of federal officials is to stand the constitutional design on its head.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>As we have said, the decision in <em>Bivens</em> established that a citizen suffering a compensable injury to a constitutionally protected interest could invoke the general federal question jurisdiction of the district courts to obtain an award of monetary damages against the responsible federal official.  As Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in the judgment, pointed out, the action for damages recognized in <em>Bivens</em> could be a vital means of providing redress for persons whose constitutional rights have been violated.  The barrier of sovereign immunity is frequently impenetrable. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Injunctive or declaratory relief is useless to a person who has already been injured.  "For  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 438 U. S. 505</a></p><p> people in Bivens\' shoes, it is damages or nothing."  403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#410">403 U. S. 410</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in <em>Bivens</em> put aside the immunity question; but we could not have contemplated that immunity would be absolute. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  If, as the Government argues, all officials exercising discretion were exempt from personal liability, a suit under the Constitution could provide no redress to the injured citizen, nor would it in any degree deter federal officials from committing constitutional wrongs.  Moreover, no compensation would be available from the Government, for the Tort Claims Act prohibits recovery for injuries stemming from discretionary acts, even when that discretion has been abused. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>The extension of absolute immunity from damages liability to all federal executive officials would seriously erode the protection provided by basic constitutional guarantees.  The broad authority possessed by these officials enables them to direct their subordinates to undertake a wide range of projects -- including some which may infringe such important personal interests as liberty, property, and free speech.  It makes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 438 U. S. 506</a></p><p> little sense to hold that a Government agent is liable for warrantless and forcible entry into a citizen\'s house in pursuit of evidence, but that an official of higher rank who actually orders such a burglary is immune simply because of his greater authority.  Indeed, the greater power of such officials affords a greater potential for a regime of lawless conduct.  Extensive Government operations offer opportunities for unconstitutional action on a massive scale.  In situations of abuse, an action for damages against the responsible official can be an important means of vindicating constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p>Our system of jurisprudence rests on the assumption that all individuals, whatever their position in government, are subject to federal law:</p>\n<p>"No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity.  All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Lee,</em> 106 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/196/case.html#220">106 U. S. 220</a></span>.  <em><span class="l-seealso">See also <a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v. Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137 (1803); <em>Scheuer v.

In light of this principle, federal officials who seek absolute exemption from personal liability for unconstitutional conduct must bear the burden of showing that public policy requires an exemption of that scope.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that considerations of public policy fail to support a limited immunity for federal executive officials.  We consider here, as we did in <em>Scheuer,</em> the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.  Yet <em>Scheuer</em> and other cases have recognized that it is not unfair to hold liable the official who knows or should know he is acting outside the law, and that insisting on an awareness of clearly established constitutional limits will not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 438 U. S. 507</a></p><p> unduly interfere with the exercise of official judgment.  We therefore hold that, in a suit for damages arising from unconstitutional action, federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only to the qualified immunity specified in <em>Scheuer,</em> subject to those exceptional situations where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of the public business. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>The <em>Scheuer</em> principle of only qualified immunity for constitutional violations is consistent with <em>Barr v. Matteo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/564/case.html">360 U. S. 564</a></span> (1959), <em>Spalding v. Vilas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html">161 U. S. 483</a></span> (1896), and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/87/case.html">Kendall v. Stokes,</a></span></em> 3 How. 87 (1847).  Federal officials will not be liable for mere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one of law.  But we see no substantial basis for holding, as the United States would have us do, that executive officers generally may with impunity discharge their duties in a way that is known to them to violate the United States Constitution or in a manner that they should know transgresses a clearly established constitutional rule.  The principle should prove as workable in suits against federal officials as it has in the context of suits against state officials.  Insubstantial lawsuits can be quickly terminated by federal courts alert to the possibilities of artful pleading.  Unless the complaint states a compensable claim for relief under the Federal Constitution, it should not survive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 438 U. S. 508</a></p><p> a motion to dismiss.  Moreover, the Court recognized in <em>Scheuer</em> that damages suits concerning constitutional violations need not proceed to trial, but can be terminated on a properly supported motion for summary judgment based on the defense of immunity. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  <em>See</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#250">416 U. S. 250</a></span>.  In responding to such a motion, plaintiffs may not play dog in the manger; and firm application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will ensure that federal officials are not harassed by frivolous lawsuits.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although a qualified immunity from damages liability should be the general rule for executive officials charged with constitutional violations, our decisions recognize that there are some officials whose special functions require a full exemption from liability.  <em>E.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html">80 U. S. </a></span> Fisher,</em> 13 Wall. 335 (1872); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span> (1976).  In each case, we have undertaken "a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the interests behind it."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#421">424 U. S. 421</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bradley v. Fisher,</em> the Court analyzed the need for absolute immunity to protect judges from lawsuits claiming that their decisions had been tainted by improper motives.  The Court began by noting that the principle of immunity for acts done by judges "in the exercise of their judicial functions" had been "the settled doctrine of the English courts for many centuries, and has never been denied, that we are aware of, in the courts of this country."  13 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#347">80 U. S. 347</a></span>.  The Court explained that the value of this rule was proved by experience.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 438 U. S. 509</a></p><p> Judges were often called to decide</p>\n<p>"[c]ontroversies involving not merely great pecuniary interests, but the liberty and character of the parties, and consequently exciting the deepest feelings."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#348">80 U. S. 348</a></span>.  Such adjudications invariably produced at least one losing party, who would "accep[t] anything but the soundness of the decision in explanation of the action of the judge."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>"Just in proportion to the strength of his convictions of the correctness of his own view of the case is he apt to complain of the judgment against him, and from complaints of the judgment to pass to the ascription of improper motives to the judge."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  If a civil action could be maintained against a judge by virtue of an allegation of malice, judges would lose "that independence without which no judiciary can either be respectable or useful."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#347">80 U.

Thus, judges were held to be immune from civil suit "for malice or corruption in their action whilst exercising their judicial functions within the general scope of their jurisdiction."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#354">80 U.

The Court of Appeals in that case discussed in detail the common law precedents extending absolute immunity to parties participating in the judicial process:  judges, grand jurors, petit jurors, advocates, and witnesses.

Parman,</em> 101 Kan. 115, 116, 165 P. 663 (1917).  The court held the prosecutor in that case immune from suit for malicious prosecution, and this Court, citing <em>Bradley v. Fisher, supra,</em> affirmed.</p>\n<p>We recently reaffirmed the holding of <em>Yaselli v. Goff</em> in <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra,</em> a suit against a state prosecutor under \xc2\xa7 1983.  The Court\'s examination of the leading precedents led to the conclusion that</p>\n<p>"[t]he common law immunity of a prosecutor is based upon the same considerations that underlie the common law immunities of judges and grand jurors acting within the scope of their duties."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#422">424 U.

S. 426</a></span> n. 24, but also by affecting the prosecutor\'s conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p>"Attaining the system\'s goal of accurately determining guilt or innocence requires that both the prosecution and the defense have wide discretion in the conduct of the trial and the presentation of evidence. . . .  If prosecutors were hampered in exercising their judgment as to the use of . . . witnesses by concern about resulting personal liability, the triers of fact in criminal cases often would be denied relevant evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#426">424 U.

S. 511</a></p><p> In light of these and other practical considerations, the Court held that the defendant in that case was entitled to absolute immunity with respect to his activities as an advocate,</p>\n<p>"activities [which] were intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, and thus were functions to which the reasons for absolute immunity apply with full force."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#430">424 U. S. 430</a></span>. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>Despite these precedents, the Court of Appeals concluded that all of the defendants in this case -- including the Chief Hearing Examiner, Judicial Officer, and prosecuting attorney -- were entitled to only a qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that officials within the Executive Branch generally have more circumscribed discretion, and pointed out that, unlike a judge, officials of the Executive Branch would face no conflict of interest if their legal representation was provided by the Executive Branch.  The Court of Appeals recognized that</p>\n<p>"some of the Agriculture Department officials may be analogized to criminal prosecutors, in that they initiated the proceedings against [respondent], and presented evidence therein,"</p>\n<p>535 F.2d at 696 n. 8, but found that attorneys in administrative proceedings did not face the same "serious constraints of time and even information" which this Court has found to be present frequently in criminal cases.  <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#425">424 U. S. 425</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We think that the Court of Appeals placed undue emphasis on the fact that the officials sued here are -- from an administrative perspective -- employees of the Executive Branch.  Judges have absolute immunity not because of their particular location within the Government, but because of the special nature of their responsibilities.  This point is underlined by the fact that prosecutors -- themselves members of the Executive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 438 U. S. 512</a></p><p> Branch are also absolutely immune.</p>\n<p>"It is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of the judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors being referred to as \'quasi-judicial\' officers, and their immunities being termed \'quasi-judicial\' as well."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#423">424 U. S. 423</a></span> n. 20.</p>\n<p>The cluster of immunities protecting the various participants in judge-supervised trials stems from the characteristics of the judicial process, rather than its location.  As the <em>Bradley</em> Court suggested, 13 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#348">80 U. S. 348</a></span>-349, controversies sufficiently intense to erupt in litigation are not easily capped by a judicial decree.  The loser in one forum will frequently seek another, charging the participants in the first with unconstitutional animus.  <em>See Pierson v. Ray,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html#554">386 U. S. 554</a></span>.  Absolute immunity is thus necessary to assure that judges, advocates, and witnesses can perform their respective functions without harassment or intimidation.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the safeguards built into the judicial process tend to reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct.  The insulation of the judge from political influence, the importance of precedent in resolving controversies, the adversary nature of the process, and the correctability of error on appeal are just a few of the many checks on malicious action by judges. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Advocates are restrained not only by their professional obligations, but by the knowledge that their assertions will be contested by their adversaries in open court.  Jurors are carefully screened to remove all possibility of bias.  Witnesses are, of course, subject to the rigors of cross-examination and the penalty of perjury.  Because these features of the judicial process tend to enhance the reliability of information and the impartiality of the decisionmaking process, there is a less pressing need for individual suits to correct constitutional error.</p>\n<p>We think that adjudication within a federal administrative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 438 U. S. 513</a></p><p> agency shares enough of the characteristics of the judicial process that those who participate in such adjudication should also be immune from suits for damages.  The conflicts which federal hearing examiners seek to resolve are every bit as fractious as those which come to court.  As the <em>Bradley</em> opinion points out:</p>\n<p>"When the controversy involves questions affecting large amounts of property or relates to a matter of general public concern, or touches the interests of numerous parties, the disappointment occasioned by an adverse decision often finds vent in imputations of [malice]."</p>\n<p>13 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#348">80 U. S. 348</a></span>.  Moreover, federal administrative law requires that agency adjudication contain many of the same safeguards as are available in the judicial process.  The proceedings are adversary in nature.  <em>See</em> 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 555(b) (1976 ed.).  They are conducted before a trier of fact insulated from political influence.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 554(d).  A party is entitled to present his case by oral or documentary evidence, \xc2\xa7 556(d), and the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with the pleadings, constitute the exclusive record for decision.  \xc2\xa7 556(e).  The parties are entitled to know the findings and conclusions on all of the issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record.  \xc2\xa7 557(c).</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt that the role of the modern federal hearing examiner or administrative law judge within this framework is "functionally comparable" to that of a judge.  His powers are often, if not generally, comparable to those of a trial judge:  he may issue subpoenas, rule on proffers of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing, and make or recommend decisions.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 556(c).  More importantly, the process of agency adjudication is currently structured so as to assure that the hearing examiner exercises his independent judgment on the evidence before him, free from pressures by the parties or other officials within the agency.  Prior to the Administrative Procedure Act, there was considerable concern that persons hearing administrative cases at the trial level could not exercise independent judgment because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 438 U. S. 514</a></p><p> they were required to perform prosecutorial and investigative functions as well as their judicial work, <em>see, e.g., Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/33/case.html">339 U. S. 33</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/33/case.html#36">339 U. S. 36</a></span>-41 (1950), and because they were often subordinate to executive officials within the agency, <em>see Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners Conference,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/128/case.html">345 U. S. 128</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/128/case.html#131">345 U. S. 131</a></span> (1953).  Since the securing of fair and competent hearing personnel was viewed as "the heart of formal administrative adjudication," Final Report of the Attorney General\'s Committee on Administrative Procedure 46 (1941), the Administrative Procedure Act contains a number of provisions designed to guarantee the independence of hearing examiners.  They may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties as hearing examiners.  5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3105 (1976 ed.).  When conducting a hearing under \xc2\xa7 5 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 554 (1976 ed.), a hearing examiner is not responsible to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, employees or agents engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecution functions for the agency.  5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 554(d)(2) (1976 ed.).  Nor may a hearing examiner consult any person or party, including other agency officials, concerning a fact at issue in the hearing, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. \xc2\xa7 554(d)(1).  Hearing examiners must be assigned to cases in rotation so far as is practicable.  \xc2\xa7 3105.  They may be removed only for good cause established and determined by the Civil Service Commission after a hearing on the record.  \xc2\xa7 7521.  Their pay is also controlled by the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p>In light of these safeguards, we think that the risk of an unconstitutional act by one presiding at an agency hearing is clearly outweighed by the importance of preserving the independent judgment of these men and women.  We therefore hold that persons subject to these restraints and performing adjudicatory functions within a federal agency are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their judicial acts.  Those who complain of error in such proceedings must seek agency or judicial review. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 438 U. S. 515</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We also believe that agency officials performing certain functions analogous to those of a prosecutor should be able to claim absolute immunity with respect to such acts.  The decision to initiate administrative proceedings against an individual or corporation is very much like the prosecutor\'s decision to initiate or move forward with a criminal prosecution.  An agency official, like a prosecutor, may have broad discretion in deciding whether a proceeding should be brought and what sanctions should be sought.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for example, may initiate proceedings whenever it has "reason to believe" that any person "is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission."  7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 9 (1976 ed.).  A range of sanctions is open to it.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The discretion which executive officials exercise with respect to the initiation of administrative proceedings might be distorted if their immunity from damages arising from that decision was less than complete.  <em>Cf. Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#426">424 U. S. 426</a></span> n. 24.  While there is not likely to be anyone willing and legally able to seek damages from the officials if they do not authorize the administrative proceeding, <em>cf. id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#438">424 U. S. 438</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment), there is a serious danger that the decision to authorize proceedings will provoke a retaliatory response.  An individual targeted by an administrative proceeding will react angrily, and may seek vengeance in the courts.  A corporation will muster all of its financial and legal resources in an effort to prevent administrative sanctions.  "When millions may turn on regulatory decisions, there is a strong incentive to counter-attack." [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]</p>\n<p>The defendant in an enforcement proceeding has ample opportunity to challenge the legality of the proceeding.  An </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 438 U. S. 516</a></p><p> administrator\'s decision to proceed with a case is subject to scrutiny in the proceeding itself.  The respondent may present his evidence to an impartial trier of fact and obtain an independent judgment as to whether the prosecution is justified.  His claims that the proceeding is unconstitutional may also be heard by the courts.  Indeed, respondent in this case was able to quash the administrative order entered against him by means of judicial review.  <em>See Economou v. U.S. Department of Agriculture,</em> 494 F.2d 519 (CA2 1974).</p>\n<p>We believe that agency officials must make the decision to move forward with an administrative proceeding free from intimidation or harassment.  Because the legal remedies already available to the defendant in such a proceeding provide sufficient checks on agency zeal, we hold that those officials who are responsible for the decision to initiate or continue a proceeding subject to agency adjudication are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their parts in that decision.</p>\n<p>We turn finally to the role of an agency attorney in conducting a trial and presenting evidence on the record to the trier of fact.  We can see no substantial difference between the function of the agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  In either case, the evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 438 U. S. 517</a></p><p> will be subject.to attack through cross-examination, rebuttal, or reinterpretation by opposing counsel.  Evidence which is false or unpersuasive should be rejected upon analysis by an impartial trier of fact.  If agency attorneys were held personally liable in damages as guarantors of the quality of their evidence, they might hesitate to bring forward some witnesses or documents.</p>\n<p>"This is particularly so because it is very difficult, if not impossible, for attorneys to be absolutely certain of the objective truth or falsity of the testimony which they present."</p>\n<p><em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#440">424 U. S. 440</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).

Administrative agencies can act in the public interest only if they can adjudicate on the basis of a complete record.  We therefore hold that an agency attorney who arranges for the presentation of evidence on the record in the course of an adjudication is absolutely immune from suits based on the introduction of such evidence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>There remains the task of applying the foregoing principles to the claims against the particular petitioner-defendants involved in this case.

It is not necessary, nor is it usual, to say that he shall not be punished for obeying this order.  His security is implied in the order itself.  It is no unusual thing for an act of congress to imply, without expressing, this very exemption from State control. . . .  The collectors of the revenue, the carriers of the mail, the mint establishment, and all those institutions which are public in their nature, are examples in point.  It has never been doubted that all who are employed in them are protected while in the line of duty; and yet this protection is not expressed in any act of congress.

These principles, however, were not said to be completely applicable; and, as indicated in the text, the Court revealed no intention to overrule <em>Kendall v.

Also, on the face of the <em>Spalding</em> opinion, it would appear that an executive officer would be vulnerable if he took action "manifestly or palpably" beyond his authority or ignored a clear limitation on his enforcement powers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>MR.

The case may stand for no more than the proposition that, where a Cabinet officer publishes a statement, not factually inaccurate, relating to a matter within his Department\'s competence, he cannot be charged with improper motives in publication.  The Court\'s opinion leaned heavily on the fact that the contents of the statement (which were not on their face defamatory) were quite accurate, in support of its conclusion that publishing the statement was within the officer\'s discretion, foreclosing inquiry into his motives.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/161/483/case.html#489">161 U.

Like the highest executive officer of a state, the head of a Federal executive department has broad discretionary authority.  Each is called upon to act under circumstances where judgments are tentative and an unambiguously optimal course of action can be ascertained only in retrospect.  Both officials have functions and responsibilities concerned with maintaining the public order; these may impel both officials to make decisions \'in an atmosphere of confusion, ambiguity, and swiftly moving events.\'  <em>Scheuer v.

Having a wider territorial responsibility than the head of a state government, a Federal cabinet officer may be entitled to consult fewer sources and expend less effort inquiring into the circumstances of a localized problem.  But these considerations go to the showing an officer vested with a qualified immunity must make in support of \'good faith belief;\' they do not make the qualified immunity itself inappropriate.

With the growing awareness that this reliance had been misplaced, however, Congress recognized the need for original federal court jurisdiction as a means to provide at least indirect federal control over the unconstitutional actions of state officials."</p>\n<p>(Footnotes omitted.)  The situation with respect to federal officials was entirely different:  they were already subject to judicial control through the state courts, which were not particularly sympathetic to federal officials, or through the removal jurisdiction of the federal courts.  <em>See generally Willingham v.

Moreover, in 1875, Congress vested the circuit courts with general federal question jurisdiction, which encompassed many suits against federal officials.  18 Stat. 470.  Thus, the absence of a statute similar to \xc2\xa7 1983 pertaining to federal officials cannot be the basis for an inference about the level of immunity appropriate to federal officials.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>Bivens</em> decision, the Federal Tort Claims Act prohibited recovery against the Government for</p>\n<p>"Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2680(h).

Nor do we think that administrative enforcement proceedings may be distinguished from criminal prosecutions on the ground that the former often turn on documentary proof.

I cannot agree, however, with the Court\'s conclusion that, in a suit for damages arising from allegedly unconstitutional action, federal executive officials, regardless of their rank or the scope of their responsibilities, are entitled to only qualified immunity even when acting within the outer limits of their authority.  The Court\'s protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, this decision seriously misconstrues our prior decisions, finds little support as a matter of logic or precedent, and, perhaps most importantly, will, I fear, seriously "dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties," <em>Gregoire v. Biddle,</em> 177 F.2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949) (Learned Hand, J.).</p>\n<p>Most noticeable is the Court\'s unnaturally constrained reading of the landmark case of <em>Spalding v. Vilas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html">161 U. S. 483</a></span> (1896).  The Court in that case did indeed hold that the actions taken by the Postmaster General were within the authority conferred upon him by Congress, and went on to hold that, even though he had acted maliciously in carrying out the duties conferred upon him by Congress, he was protected by official immunity.  But the Court left no doubt that it would have reached the same result had it been alleged the official acts were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>"We are of the opinion that the same general considerations of public policy and convenience which demand for judges of courts of superior jurisdiction immunity from civil suits for damages arising from acts done by them in the course of the performance of their judicial functions apply to a large extent to official communications made by heads of Executive Departments when engaged in the discharge of duties imposed upon them by law.  The interests of the people require that due protection be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 438 U. S. 519</a></p><p> accorded to them. in respect of their official acts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#498">161 U. S. 498</a></span>.  The Court today attempts to explain away that language by observing that <em>Spalding</em> indicated no intention to overrule <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/87/case.html">Kendall v. Stokes,</a></span></em> 3 How. 87 (1845), or <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/48/89/case.html">Wilkes v. Dinsman,</a></span></em> 7 How. 89 (1849).  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#493">438 U. S. 493</a></span> n. 18.  But as the Court itself observes, the Postmaster General was held not "liable in an action for an error of judgment" in <em>Kendall, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/87/case.html#98">44 U. S. 98</a></span>.  The Court in <em>Wilkes, supra,</em> likewise exonerated the defendant.  The Court did indicate in dictum in both those cases that a federal officer might be liable if he acted with malice, <em>Kendall, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/87/case.html#99">44 U. S. 99</a></span>; <em>Wilkes, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/48/89/case.html#131">48 U. S. 131</a></span>, but the holding in <em>Spalding</em> was, as even the Court is forced to admit today, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#492">438 U. S. 492</a></span>-493, directly contrary to those cases on that point.  In short, <em>Spalding</em> clearly and inescapably stands for the proposition that high-ranking executive officials acting within the outer limits of their authority are absolutely immune from suit.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the language from <em>Spalding</em> quoted above unquestionably applies with equal force in the case at bar.  No one seriously contends that the Secretary of Agriculture or the Assistant Secretary, who are being sued for $32 million in damages, had wandered completely off the official reservation in authorizing prosecution of respondent for violation of regulations promulgated by the Secretary for the regulation of "futures commission merchants," 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6 (1976 ed.).  This is precisely what the Secretary and his assistants were empowered and required to do.  That they would on occasion be mistaken in their judgment that a particular merchant had in fact violated the regulations is a necessary concomitant of any known system of administrative adjudication; that they acted "maliciously" gives no support to respondent\'s claim against them unless we are to overrule <em>Spalding.</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s attempt to distinguish <em>Spalding</em> may be predicated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 438 U. S. 520</a></p><p> on a simpler but equally erroneous concept of immunity.  At one point, the Court observes that, even under <em>Spalding,</em></p>\n<p>"an executive officer would be vulnerable if he took action \'manifestly or palpably\' beyond his authority or ignored a clear limitation on his enforcement powers."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#493">438 U. S. 493</a></span> n. 18.  From that proposition, which is undeniably accurate, the Court appears to conclude that anytime a plaintiff can paint his grievance in constitutional colors, the official is subject to damages unless he can prove he acted in good faith.  After all, Congress would never "authorize" an official to engage in unconstitutional conduct.  That this notion in fact underlies the Court\'s decision is strongly suggested by its discussion of numerous cases which supposedly support its position, but all of which, in fact, deal not with the question of what level of immunity a federal official may claim when acting within the outer limits of his authority, but rather with the question of whether he was, in fact, so acting.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#489">438 U. S. 489</a></span>-491.</p>\n<p>Putting to one side the illogic and impracticability of distinguishing between constitutional and common law claims for purposes of immunity, which will be discussed shortly, this sort of immunity analysis badly misses the mark.  It amounts to saying that an official has immunity until someone alleges he has acted unconstitutionally.  But that is no immunity at all:  the "immunity" disappears at the very moment when it is needed.  The critical inquiry in determining whether an official is entitled to claim immunity is not whether someone has in fact been injured by his action; that is part of the plaintiff\'s case in chief.  The immunity defense turns on whether the action was one taken "when engaged in the discharge of duties imposed upon [the official] by law," <em>Spalding,</em> 161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#498">161 U. S. 498</a></span>, or, in other words, whether the official was acting within the outer bounds of his authority.  Only if the immunity inquiry is approached in this manner does it have any meaning.  That such a rule may occasionally result in individual injustices has never been doubted, but at least until </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 438 U. S. 521</a></p><p> today, immunity has been accorded nevertheless.  As Judge Learned Hand said in <em>Gregoire v. Biddle,</em> 177 F.2d at 581:</p>\n<p>"The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.  Again and again the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake, in the face of which an official may later find himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith.  There must indeed be means of punishing public officers who have been truant to their duties, but that is quite another matter from exposing such as have been honestly mistaken to suit by anyone who has suffered from their errors.  As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative.  In this instance, it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation. . . ."</p>\n<p>Indeed, in that very case, Judge Hand laid bare the folly of approaching the question of immunity in the manner suggested today by the Court.</p>\n<p>"The decisions have, indeed, always imposed as a limitation upon the immunity that the official\'s act must have been within the scope of his powers; and it can be argued that official powers, since they exist only for the public good, never cover occasions where the public good is not their aim, and hence that to exercise a power dishonestly is necessarily to overstep its bounds.  A moment\'s reflection shows, however, that that cannot be the meaning of the limitation without defeating the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 438 U. S. 522</a></p><p> whole doctrine.  What is meant by saying that the officer must be acting within his power cannot be more than that the occasion must be such as would have justified the act, if he had been using his power for any of the purposes on whose account it was vested in him. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p><em>Barr v. Matteo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/564/case.html">360 U. S. 564</a></span> (1959), unfortunately fares little better at the Court\'s hand than <em>Spalding.</em>  Here the Court at least recognizes and reaffirms the minimum proposition for which <em>Barr</em> stands -- that executive officials are absolutely immune at least from actions predicated on common law claims as long as they are acting within the outer limits of their authority.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#495">438 U. S. 495</a></span>.  <em>Barr</em> is distinguished, however, on the ground that it did not involve a violation of "those fundamental principles of fairness embodied in the Constitution."  <em>Ibid.</em>  But if we allow a mere allegation of unconstitutionality, obviously unproved at the time made, to require a Cabinet-level official, charged with the enforcement of the responsibilities to which the complaint pertains, to lay aside his duties and defend such an action on the merits, the defense of official immunity will have been abolished in fact, if not in form.  The ease with which a constitutional claim may be pleaded in a case such as this, where a violation of statutory or judicial limits on agency action may be readily converted by any legal neophyte into a claim of denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment, will assure that.  The fact that the claim fails when put to trial will not prevent the consumption of time, effort, and money on the part of the defendant official in defending his actions on the merits.  The result can only be damage to the "interests of the people," <em>Spalding, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#498">161 U. S. 498</a></span>, which "require[s] that due protection be accorded to [Cabinet officials] in respect of their official acts."</p>\n<p>It likewise cannot seriously be argued that an official will be less deterred by the threat of liability for unconstitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 438 U. S. 523</a></p><p> conduct than for activities which might constitute a common law tort.  The fear that inhibits is that of a long, involved lawsuit and a significant money judgment, not the fear of liability for a certain type of claim.  Thus, even viewing the question functionally -- indeed, <em>especially</em> viewing the question functionally -- the basis for a distinction between constitutional and common law torts in this context is open to serious question.  Even the logical justification for raising such a novel distinction is far from clear.  That the Framers thought some rights sufficiently susceptible of legislative derogation that they should be enshrined in the Constitution does not necessarily indicate that the Framers likewise intended to establish an immutable hierarchy of rights in terms of their importance to individuals.  The most heinous common law tort surely cannot be less important to, or have less of an impact on, the aggrieved individual than a mere technical violation of a constitutional proscription.</p>\n<p>The Court purports to find support for this distinction, and therefore this result, in the principles supposedly underlying <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v. Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137 (1803) and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971), and the fact that cognate state officials are not afforded absolute immunity for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.  Undoubtedly these rationales have some superficial appeal, but none withstands careful analysis.  <em>Marbury v. Madison, supra,</em> leaves no doubt that the high position of a Government official does not insulate his actions from judicial review.  But that case, like numerous others which have followed, involved equitable-type relief by way of mandamus or injunction.  In the present case, respondent sought damages in the amount of $32 million.  There is undoubtedly force to the argument that injunctive relief, in these cases where a court determines that an official defendant has violated a legal right of the plaintiff, sets the matter right only as to the future.  But there is at least as much force to the argument </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 438 U. S. 524</a></p><p> that the threat of injunctive relief without the possibility of damages in the case of a Cabinet official is a better tailoring of the competing need to vindicate individual rights, on the one hand, and the equally vital need, on the other, that federal officials exercising discretion will be unafraid to take vigorous action to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p>The Court also suggests in sweeping terms that the cause of action recognized in <em>Bivens</em> would be "drained of meaning\' if federal officials were entitled to absolute immunity for their constitutional transgressions." <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#501">438 U. S. 501</a></span>.  But <em>Bivens</em> is a slender reed on which to rely when abrogating official immunity for Cabinet-level officials.  In the first place, those officials most susceptible to claims under <em>Bivens</em> have historically been given only a qualified immunity.  As the Court observed in <em>Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html#555">386 U. S. 555</a></span> (1967), "[t]he common law has never granted police officers an absolute and unqualified immunity. . . ."  In any event, it certainly does not follow that a grant of absolute immunity to the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of Agriculture requires a like grant to federal law enforcement officials.  But even more importantly, on the federal side, when Congress thinks redress of grievances is appropriate, it can and generally does waive sovereign immunity, allowing an action directly against the United States.  This allows redress for deprivations of rights, while at the same time limiting the outside influences which might inhibit an official in the free and considered exercise of his official powers.  In fact, Congress, making just these sorts of judgments with respect to the very causes of action which the Court suggests require abrogation of absolute immunity, has amended the Federal Tort Claims Act, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2680(h) (1976 ed.), to allow suits against the United States on the basis of certain intentional torts if committed by federal "investigative or law enforcement officers."</p>\n<p>The Court also looks to the question of immunity of state officials for causes arising under \xc2\xa7 1983 and, quoting a concurring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="525">Page 438 U. S. 525</a></p><p> opinion in <em>Anderson v. Nosser,</em> 438 F.2d 183, 205 (CA5 1971), to the effect that there should not be "one law for Athens and another for Rome," finds no reason why those principles should not likewise apply when federal officers are the target.  Homilies cannot replace analysis in this difficult area, however.  And even a moment\'s reflection on the nature of the <em>Bivens</em>-type action and the purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983, as made abundantly clear in this Court\'s prior cases, supplies a compelling reason for distinguishing between the two different situations.  In the first place, as made clear above, a grant of absolute immunity to high-ranking executive officials on the federal side would not eviscerate the cause of action recognized in <em>Bivens.</em>  The officials who are the most likely defendants in a <em>Bivens</em>-type action have generally been accorded only a qualified immunity.  But more importantly, Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity for this type of suit.  This permits a direct action against the Government, while limiting those risks which might "dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties."  And the Federal Government can internally supervise and check its own officers.  The Federal Government is not so situated that it can control state officials or strike this same balance, however.  Hence, the necessity of \xc2\xa7 1983 and the differing standards of immunity.  As the Court observed in <em>District of Columbia v. Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html">409 U. S. 418</a></span> (1973):</p>\n<p>"Although there are threads of many thoughts running through the debates on the 1871 Act, it seems clear that \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act, with which we are here concerned, was designed primarily in response to unwillingness or inability of the state governments to enforce their own laws against those violating the civil rights of others."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/418/case.html#426">409 U.

But that suggestion evinces a basic misunderstanding of the difference between a statute which vests jurisdiction in federal courts, which are, as a constitutional matter, courts of limited jurisdiction, and a statute, or even a constitutional provision, which creates a private right of action.  As even the Court\'s analysis in <em>Bivens</em> made clear, a statute giving jurisdiction to federal courts does not, in and of itself, create a right of action.  And to date the Court has not held that the Constitution itself creates a private right of action for damages except when federal law enforcement officials arrest someone and search his premises in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, the Court\'s attempt to equate \xc2\xa7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331 (1976 ed.) simply fails, and its further observation -- that there should be no difference in immunity between state and federal officials -- remains subject to serious doubt.</p>\n<p>My biggest concern, however, is not with the illogic or impracticality of today\'s decision, but rather with the potential for disruption of Government that it invites.  The steady increase in litigation, much of it directed against governmental officials and virtually all of which could be framed in constitutional terms, cannot escape the notice of even the most casual observer.  From 1961 to 1977, the number of cases brought in the federal courts under civil rights statutes increased from 29 to 13,113.  <em>See</em> Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts Ann.Rep. 189, Table 11 (1977); Ann.Rep. 173, Table 17 (1976).  It simply defies logic and common experience to suggest that officials will not have this in the back of their minds when considering </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 438 U. S. 527</a></p><p> what official course to pursue.  It likewise strains credulity to suggest that this threat will only inhibit officials from taking action which they should not take in any event.  It is the cases in which the grounds for action are doubtful, or in which the actor is timid, which will be affected by today\'s decision.</p>\n<p>The Court, of course, recognizes this problem, and suggests two solutions.  First, judges, ever alert to the artful pleader, supposedly will weed out insubstantial claims.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#507">438 U. S. 507</a></span>.  That, I fear, shows more optimism than prescience.  Indeed, this very case, unquestionably frivolous in the extreme, belies any hope in that direction.  And summary judgment on affidavits and the like is even more inappropriate when the central, and perhaps only, inquiry is the official\'s state of mind.  <em>See</em> C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 493 (3d ed.1976) (It "is not feasible to resolve on motion for summary judgment cases involving state of mind"); <em>Subin v. Goldsmith,</em> 224 F.2d 753 (CA2 1955).</p>\n<p>The second solution offered by the Court is even less satisfactory.  The Court holds that, in those special circumstances "where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of the public business," absolute immunity will be extended.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#507">438 U. S. 507</a></span>.  But this is a form of "absolute immunity" which, in truth, exists in name only.  If, for example, the Secretary of Agriculture may never know until inquiry by a trial court whether there is a possibility that vexatious constitutional litigation will interfere with his decisionmaking process, the Secretary will obviously think not only twice but thrice about whether to prosecute a litigious commodities merchant who has played fast and loose with the regulations for his own profit.  Careful consideration of the rights of every individual subject to his jurisdiction is one thing; a timorous reluctance to prosecute any of such individuals who have a reputation for using litigation as a defense weapon is quite another.  Since Cabinet officials are mortal, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 438 U. S. 528</a></p><p> it is not likely that we shall get the precise judgmental balance desired in each of them, and it is because of these very human failings that the principles of <em>Spalding,</em> 161 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/483/case.html#498">161 U. S. 498</a></span>, dictate that absolute immunity be accorded once it be concluded by a court that a high-level executive official was "engaged in the discharge of duties imposed upon [him] by law." <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Today\'s opinion has shouldered a formidable task insofar as it seeks to justify the rejection of the views of the first Mr. Justice Harlan expressed in his opinion for the Court in <em>Spalding v. Vilas, supra,</em> and those of the second Mr. Justice Harlan expressed in his opinions in <em>Barr v. Matteo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/564/case.html">360 U. S. 564</a></span> (1959), and its companion case of <em>Howard v. Lyons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/593/case.html">360 U. S. 593</a></span> (1959).  In terms of juridical jousting, if not in terms of placement in the judicial hierarchy, it has taken on at least as formidable a task when it disregards the powerful statement of Judge Learned Hand in <em>Gregoire v. Biddle,</em> 177 F.2d 579 (CA2 1949). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 438 U. S. 529</a></p><p></p>\n<p>History will surely not condemn the Court for its effort to achieve a more finely ground product from the judicial mill, a product which would both retain the necessary ability of public officials to govern and yet assure redress to those who are the victims of official wrongs.  But if such a system of redress for official wrongs was indeed capable of being achieved in practice, it surely would not have been rejected by this Court speaking through the first Mr. Justice Harlan in 1896, by this Court speaking through the second Mr. Justice Harlan in 1959, and by Judge Learned Hand speaking for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1948.  These judges were not inexperienced neophytes who lacked the vision or the ability to define immunity doctrine to accomplish that result had they thought it possible.  Nor were they obsequious toadies in their attitude toward high-ranking officials of coordinate branches of the Federal Government.  But they did see with more prescience than the Court does today that there are inevitable trade-offs in connection with any doctrine of official liability and immunity.  They forthrightly accepted the possibility that an occasional failure to redress a claim of official wrongdoing would result from the doctrine of absolute immunity which they espoused, viewing it as a lesser evil than the impairment of the ability of responsible public officials to govern.</p>\n<p>But while I believe that history will look approvingly on the motives of the Court in reaching the result it does today, I do not believe that history will be charitable in its judgment of the all but inevitable result of the doctrine espoused by the Court in this case.  That doctrine seeks to gain and hold a middle ground which, with all deference, I believe the teachings of those who were at least our equals suggest cannot long be held.  That part of the Court\'s present opinion from which I dissent will, I fear, result in one of two evils, either one of which is markedly worse than the effect of according absolute immunity to the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 438 U. S. 530</a></p><p> case.  The first of these evils would be a significant impairment of the ability of responsible public officials to carry out the duties imposed upon them by law.  If that evil is to be avoided after today, it can be avoided only by a necessarily unprincipled and erratic judicial "screening" of claims such as those made in this case, an adherence to the form of the law while departing from its substance.  Either one of these evils is far worse than the occasional failure to award damages caused by official wrongdoing, frankly and openly justified by the rule of <em>Spalding v. Vilas, Barr v. Matteo,</em> and <em>Gregoire v. Biddle.</em></p>\n<p>* The ultimate irony of today\'s decision is that, in the area of common law official immunity, a body of law fashioned and applied by judges, absolute immunity within the federal system is extended only to judges and prosecutors functioning in the judicial system.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html">Bradley v. Fisher,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 335 (1872); <em>Yaselli v. Goff,</em> 12 F.2d 396 (CA2 1926), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 275 U.S. 503 (1927).  Similarly, where this Court has interpreted 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 in the light of common law doctrines of official immunity, again, only judges and prosecutors are accorded absolute immunity.  <em>See Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967); <em>Stump v. Sparkman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/349/case.html">435 U. S. 349</a></span> (1978); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span> (1976).  If one were to hazard an informed guess as to why such a distinction in treatment between judges and prosecutors, on the one hand, and other public officials, on the other, obtains, mine would be that those who decide the common law know through personal experience the sort of pressures that might exist for such decisionmakers in the absence of absolute immunity, but may not know, or may have forgotten, that similar pressures exist in the case of nonjudicial public officials to whom difficult decisions are committed.  But the cynical among us might not unreasonably feel that this is simply another unfortunate example of judges treating those who are not part of the judicial machinery as "lesser breeds without the law."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
