United States v. Causby, <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/256/case.html">328 U.S. 256</a>. We held that \'the flight of airplanes, which skim the surface but do not touch it, is as much an appropriation of the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it.\' We noted that the important factor is whether the intrusion impinges on \'the owner\'s full enjoyment of the property and . . . his exploitation of it.\' 328 U.S., at 264-265, 66 S.

It is a nice question when police power comes to an end as a justification for public taking of private property. Is it when the public at large is benefited at the expense of an owner of private property who is refrained from using his land in a way that is not obnoxious to his neighbors?
