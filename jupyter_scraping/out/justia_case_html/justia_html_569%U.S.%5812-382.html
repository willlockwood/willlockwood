He claimed the state courts violated his \n \nSixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap- point an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new trial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right to counseled representation.  The District Court denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition, and he appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas relief.  678 F.\xc2\xa03d 1149, 1163 (2012).  Because the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim is supported by \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2001, the State of California charged respondent with making criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and be- ing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.  Before his arraignment, respondent executed a valid waiver of his \n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel, electing to represent himself.  See Faretta v. California, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806, \n807 (1975)\n.  By the time of his preliminary hearing, however, respondent changed his mind and retained counsel.  Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again waived his right to counsel.  Two months after that, respondent again changed his mind and asked the court to appoint an attorney.  The court did so.  Shortly before trial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered his right to counsel.  He proceeded to trial pro\xc2\xa0se.  On June 27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the verdict was read, respondent asked the state trial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion for a new trial.  The trial judge deferred ruling on the motion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed the request in writing.  Neither the oral nor the written motion included reasons in support of his request; and when offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion at a later hearing, respondent declined to do so.  The trial court denied the request for counsel.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pro\xc2\xa0se motion for a new trial was likewise denied.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s convictions and sentence.  As relevant here, it concluded that his history of vacillating between counseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his motion, his demonstrated competence in defending his case, and his insistence that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98c[ould] do the motion [him]self\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98just need[ed] time to perfect it,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 129\xe2\x80\x93130, justified the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his post-trial request for counsel.  The state appellate court also distinguished its decision from that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Menefield v. Borg, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 696 (1989), reasoning that the habeas petitioner in Menefield had stated reasons justifying his request for counsel, whereas respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request was unreasoned and unexplained.  The state appellate court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to grant [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] motion, we cannot find that the court abused its discretion in declining to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 130.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent filed a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California courts had violated his \n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel by not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial motion.  The District Court denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when the trial court denied his timely request for representation for a new trial motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1163.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo reach the conclusion that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invoked certain \n \nSixth Amendment precedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in other Circuits.  From those precedents, the panel identified two relevant principles that it deemed to have been clearly established by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases: first, that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar his later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later critical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State that the reappointment request was made in bad faith, see id., at 1159\xe2\x80\x931162; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a critical stage, see id., at 1156\xe2\x80\x931159.  Combining these two propositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly established right to the reappointment of counsel for purposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California courts\xe2\x80\x94which vest the trial judge with discretion to approve or deny such requests based on the totality of the circumstances, see People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 147\xe2\x80\x93151, 38 P.\xc2\xa03d 461, 493\xe2\x80\x93495 (2002)\xe2\x80\x94violated that right by refusing to order the reappointment of counsel.  678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1162\xe2\x80\x931163.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe starting point for cases subject to \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) is to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d that governs the habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  See Williams v. Taylor, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362, \n412 (2000)\n; Knowles v. Mirzayance, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111, \n122 (2009)\n.  As indicated above, the parties here dispute whether two principles of law are clearly established under this framework.  One is whether, after a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under Faretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a critical stage of the prosecution.  For purposes of analysis here, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe other disputed question is whether, after a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion to deny the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s later request for reappointment of counsel.  In resolving this question in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Supreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to re-assert his right to counsel\xe2\x80\x9d once he has validly waived it.  678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It then (also correctly) recognized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no clearly established federal law, since \xe2\x80\x9ca general standard\xe2\x80\x9d from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases can supply such law.  Yarborough v. Alvarado, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 652, \n664 (2004)\n.  The Court of Appeals erred, however, in its application of this latter proposition to the controlling issues here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is beyond dispute that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \n \nSixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iowa v. Tovar, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77\n\xe2\x80\x9381 (2004); see United States v. Cronic, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648\n\xe2\x80\x93654 (1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, \n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, \n344 (1963)\n.  It is just as well settled, however, that a defendant also has the right to \xe2\x80\x9cproceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Faretta, 422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 807.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere can be some tension in these two principles.  As the Faretta Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 832.  California has resolved this tension by adopting the framework under review.  Under that approach, trial judges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver requests for counsel; their decisions on such requests must be based on the totality of the circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[ing] \xe2\x80\x98the quality of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] representation of [himself], the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior proclivity to substitute counsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that] might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 494 (quoting People v. Windham, 19 Cal. 3d 121, 128, 560 P.\xc2\xa02d 1187, 1191\xe2\x80\x931192 (1977); final alteration in original).  The state appellate court applied those rules to the case at bar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94and especially the shifting nature of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preferences, the unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated capacity to handle the incidents of trial\xe2\x80\x94supported the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 128\xe2\x80\x93131.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that tension differently in its own direct-review cases.  It has adopted a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strong presumption that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial request for the assistance of an attorney should not be refused,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Ignacio, 360 F.\xc2\xa03d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted), as well as a default rule that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,\xe2\x80\x99 a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s post-trial revocation of his waiver should be allowed unless the government can show that the request is made \xe2\x80\x98for a bad faith purpose,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 701; emphasis deleted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the \n \nSixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver requests of appointment of counsel.  All this case requires\xe2\x80\x94and all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x94is to observe that, in light of the tension between the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d Tovar, supra, at 80\xe2\x80\x9381, and its concurrent promise of \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a criminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that California\xe2\x80\x99s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap- plication of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d established by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assistance-of-counsel cases.

Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (per\xc2\xa0curiam) (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden [v. Wainwright, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 168 (1986)\n] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here\xe2\x80\x9d); see 678 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1155, 1157.  The error in this approach is subtle, yet substantial.  Although an appellate panel may, in accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, look to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver v. Sheets, 594 F.\xc2\xa03d 900, 916, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA6 2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established\xe2\x80\x9d); Chambers v. McDaniel, 549 F.\xc2\xa03d 1191, 1199 (CA9 2008), it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct.
