(JWM).  He sued petitioners (collectively Domino\xe2\x80\x99s) under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that JWM and Domino\xe2\x80\x99s had entered into several contracts, that Domino\xe2\x80\x99s had broken those contracts because of racial animus toward McDonald, and that the breach had harmed McDonald personally by causing him to suffer monetary damages and damages for emotional injuries.  The District Court granted<em> </em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss on the ground that McDonald could bring no \xc2\xa71981 claim against Domino\xe2\x80\x99s because McDonald was party to no contract with Domino\xe2\x80\x99s.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that an injury suffered only by the corporation would not permit a shareholder to bring a \xc2\xa71981 action, but concluded that when there are injuries distinct from those of the corporation, a nonparty like McDonald may nonetheless sue under \xc2\xa71981.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law, and as required by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text, a plaintiff cannot state a \xc2\xa71981 claim unless he has (or would have) rights under the existing (or proposed) contract that he wishes \xe2\x80\x9cto make and enforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute, originally enacted as \xc2\xa71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, now protects the equal right of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll persons\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d without respect to race, \xc2\xa71981(a), and defines \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits \xe2\x80\xa6 of the contractual relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(b).  This cannot be read to give McDonald a cause of action because he \xe2\x80\x9cmade and enforced contracts\xe2\x80\x9d for JWM as its agent.  The right to \xe2\x80\x9cmake contracts\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the 1866 legislation was not the insignificant right to act as an agent for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s contracting, but was rather the right, denied in some States to blacks, to give and receive <em>contractual rights</em> on one\xe2\x80\x99s own behalf<em>.  </em>The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text makes this common meaning doubly clear by speaking of the right to \xe2\x80\x9cmake <em>and enforce</em>\xe2\x80\x9d contracts.  When the 1866 Act was drafted, a mere agent, who had no beneficial interest in a contract he made for his principal, could not generally sue on that contract.  Any \xc2\xa71981 claim, therefore, must initially identify an impaired \xe2\x80\x9ccontractual relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(b), under which the plaintiff has rights.  McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s complaint identifies a contractual relationship between Domino\xe2\x80\x99s and JWM, but it is fundamental corporation and agency law that a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s shareholder and contracting officer has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s contracts.  McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s proposed new test for \xc2\xa71981 standing\xe2\x80\x94whereby any person may sue if he is an \xe2\x80\x9cactual target\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination and loses some benefit that would otherwise have inured to him had a contract not been impaired\xe2\x80\x94ignores the explicit statutory requirement that the plaintiff be the \xe2\x80\x9cperso[n]\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cright \xe2\x80\xa6 to make and enforce contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(a), was \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(c), on account of race.  <em>Shaare Tefila Congregation</em> v. <em>Cobb,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/615/index.html">481 U.

(JWM), a corporation organized under Nevada law.  He sued petitioners (collectively Domino\xe2\x80\x99s) in the District Court for the District of Nevada, claiming violations of \xc2\xa71981.  The allegations of the complaint, which for present purposes we assume to be true, were as follows.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0JWM and Domino\xe2\x80\x99s entered into several contracts under which JWM was to construct four restaurants in the Las Vegas area, which would be leased to Domino\xe2\x80\x99s.  After the first restaurant was completed, Domino\xe2\x80\x99s agent Debbie Pear refused to execute the estoppel certificates for JWM required by the contracts to facilitate JWM\xe2\x80\x99s bank financing.  The relationship between the parties further deteriorated when Pear persuaded the Las Vegas Valley Water District to change its records to show Domino\xe2\x80\x99s, rather than JWM, as the owner of the land JWM had acquired for restaurant construction.  McDonald had to go to the Water District to prove JWM\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of the land.  In the course of what were apparently many and fruitless discussions between McDonald and Pear, McDonald \xe2\x80\x9cexplained that he intended to see [the contracts] through to completion,\xe2\x80\x9d even though Pear made clear that unless he agreed to back out of the contractual relationship, he would suffer serious consequences.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  At one point Pear said to McDonald \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like dealing with you people anyway,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d refusing to specify what she meant by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98you people.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.  Pear threatened to use Domino\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys to \xe2\x80\x9cbury\xe2\x80\x9d McDonald if he should sue.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The contracts between Domino\xe2\x80\x99s and JWM ultimately remained uncompleted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least in part because of the failed contracts, JWM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The trustee for JWM\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate initiated an adversary proceeding against Domino\xe2\x80\x99s for breach of contract.  For whatever reason, the trustee chose not to assert a \xc2\xa71981 claim alleging Domino\xe2\x80\x99s interference with JWM\xe2\x80\x99s right to make and enforce contracts.  The breach of contract claim was settled for $45,000, and JWM gave Domino\xe2\x80\x99s a complete release.  Consequently, no further claims arising out of the same episode could be pursued on JWM\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  While the bankruptcy proceedings were still ongoing, McDonald filed the present \xc2\xa71981 claim against Domino\xe2\x80\x99s in his personal capacity.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The gravamen of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was that Domino\xe2\x80\x99s had broken its contracts with JWM because of racial animus toward McDonald, and that the breach had harmed McDonald personally by causing him \xe2\x80\x9cto suffer monetary damages and damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and humiliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 16.  The complaint demanded that Domino\xe2\x80\x99s discharge its \xe2\x80\x9cobligations under the contracts which McDonald would have received, but for the discriminatory practices, including, but not limited to front pay, back pay and other lost benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9ccompensatory damages for pecuniary losses, including pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, and humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d and punitive damages.  <em>Id.</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Domino\xe2\x80\x99s filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  It asserted that McDonald could bring no \xc2\xa71981 claim against Domino\xe2\x80\x99s because McDonald was party to no contract with Domino\xe2\x80\x99s.  The District Court granted the motion.  It noted that Domino\xe2\x80\x99s had \xe2\x80\x9crel[ied] on the basic proposition that a corporation is a separate legal entity from its stockholders and officers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 6, and concluded that a corporation may have \xe2\x80\x9cstanding to assert a \xc2\xa71981 claim\xe2\x80\x9d but that \xe2\x80\x9ca president or sole shareholder may not step into the shoes of the corporation and assert that claim personally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 7 (citing <em>Guides, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Yarmouth Group Prop. Management, Inc.</em>, 295 F.\xc2\xa03d 1065, 1072\xe2\x80\x931073 (CA10 2002)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It agreed that an \xe2\x80\x9cinjury suffered only by the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d would not permit a shareholder to bring a \xc2\xa71981 action.  107 Fed. Appx. 18 (2004).  But relying on its earlier decision in <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Alexian Bros. Hospital of San Jose</em>, 698 F.\xc2\xa02d 1019, 1021\xe2\x80\x931022 (1983), the Ninth Circuit concluded that when there are \xe2\x80\x9cinjuries distinct from that of the corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d a nonparty like McDonald may nonetheless bring suit under \xc2\xa71981.  107 Fed. Appx., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that this approach set it apart from other Circuits.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/998/index.html">544 U. S. 998</a> (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the many statutes that combat racial discrimination, \xc2\xa71981, originally \xc2\xa71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, has a specific function: It protects the equal right of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d without respect to race.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(a).  The statute currently defines \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71981(b).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McDonald argues that the statute must be read to give him a cause of action because he \xe2\x80\x9cmade and enforced contracts\xe2\x80\x9d for JWM.  On his reading of the text, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f Domino\xe2\x80\x99s refused to deal with the salesman for a pepperoni manufacturer because the salesman was black, that would violate the section 1981 right of the salesman to make a contract on behalf of his principal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 12.  We think not.  The right to \xe2\x80\x9cmake contracts\xe2\x80\x9d guaranteed by the statute was not the insignificant right to act as an agent for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s contracting\xe2\x80\x94any more than it was the insignificant right to act as amanuensis in writing out the agreement, and thus to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d the contract in that sense.  Rather, it was the right\xe2\x80\x94denied in some States to blacks, as it was denied at common law to children\xe2\x80\x94to give and receive <em>contractual rights</em> on one\xe2\x80\x99s own behalf<em>.  </em>Common usage alone is enough to establish this, but the text of the statute makes this common meaning doubly clear by speaking of the right to \xe2\x80\x9cmake <em>and enforce</em>\xe2\x80\x9d contracts.  When the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was drafted, it was well known that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n general a mere agent, who has no beneficial interest in a contract which he has made on behalf of his principal, cannot support an action thereon.\xe2\x80\x9d 1 S. Livermore, A Treatise on the Law of Principal and Agent 215 (1818).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any claim brought under \xc2\xa71981, therefore, must initially identify an impaired \xe2\x80\x9ccontractual relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(b), under which the plaintiff has rights.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Such a contractual relationship need not already exist, because \xc2\xa71981 protects the would-be contractor along with those who already have made contracts.  We made this clear in <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html">427 U. S. 160</a> (1976), which subjected defendants to liability under \xc2\xa71981 when, for racially-motivated reasons, they prevented individuals who \xe2\x80\x9c<em>sought to enter </em>into contractual relationships\xe2\x80\x9d from doing so, <em>id.</em>, at 172 (emphasis added).  We have never retreated from what should be obvious from reading the text of the statute: Section 1981 offers relief when racial discrimination blocks the creation of a contractual relationship, as well as when racial discrimination impairs an existing contractual relationship, so long as the plaintiff has or would have rights under the existing or proposed contractual relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent the requirement that the plaintiff himself must have rights under the contractual relationship, \xc2\xa71981 would become a strange remedial provision designed to fight racial animus in all of its noxious forms, but only if the animus and the hurt it produced were somehow connected to <em>somebody\xe2\x80\x99s </em>contract.  We have never read the statute in this unbounded\xe2\x80\x94or rather, <em>peculiarly</em> bounded\xe2\x80\x94way.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 176 (1989); <em>Burnett</em> v. <em>Grattan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/42/index.html">468 U. S. 42</a>, 44, n. 2 (1984); <em>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/375/index.html">458 U. S. 375</a>, 396 (1982). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor has Congress indicated that we should.  We held in <em>Patterson</em> that the prior version of \xc2\xa71981 did \xe2\x80\x9cnot apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 U. S., at 171.  In 1991, Congress amended the statute, see 105 Stat. 1071, adding \xc2\xa71981(b), which defines \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce\xe2\x80\x9d to bring postformation conduct, including discriminatory termination, within the scope of \xc2\xa71981.  See <em>Jones</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/369/index.html">541 U. S. 369</a>, 383 (2004).  But while Congress revised <em>Patterson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>exclusion of postformation conduct, it let stand <em>Patterson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>focus upon contract obligations.  In fact, it positively reinforced that element by including in the new \xc2\xa71981(b) reference to a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>contractual relationship</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s complaint does identify a contractual relationship, the one between Domino\xe2\x80\x99s and JWM.  But it is fundamental corporation and agency law\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it can be said to be the whole purpose of corporation and agency law\xe2\x80\x94that the shareholder and contracting officer of a corporation has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s contracts.  McDonald now makes light of the law of corporations and of agency\xe2\x80\x94arguing, for instance, that because he \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiated, signed, performed, and sought to enforce the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d Domino\xe2\x80\x99s was wrong to \xe2\x80\x9cinsist that [the contract] somehow was not his \xe2\x80\x98own.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 4.  This novel approach to the law contradicts McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s own experience.  Domino\xe2\x80\x99s filed a proof of claim against JWM during its corporate bankruptcy; it did <em>not </em>proceed against McDonald personally.  The corporate form and the rules of agency protected his personal assets, even though he \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiated, signed, performed, and sought to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d contracts for JWM.  The corporate form and the rules of agency similarly deny him rights under those contracts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an alternative to ignoring corporation and agency law, McDonald proposes a new test for \xc2\xa71981 standing: Any person who is an \xe2\x80\x9cactual target\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination, and who loses some benefit that would otherwise have inured to him had a contract not been impaired, may bring a suit.  Under this theory, an individual is the \xe2\x80\x9cactual target\xe2\x80\x9d if he was the <em>reason </em>a defendant chose to impair its contractual relationship with a third party.  McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s formulation simply ignores the explicit statutory requirement that the plaintiff be the \xe2\x80\x9cperso[n]\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cright \xe2\x80\xa6 to make and enforce contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(a), was \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(c), on account of race.  It is just the statutory construction we have always rejected.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McDonald points to several of our prior cases involving plaintiffs whose status as contracting parties was unclear.  Because they nonetheless prevailed, McDonald reasons, contractual privity cannot be a <em>sine qua non </em>of a \xc2\xa71981 claim.  In those cases, however, we did not discuss, much less decide, the privity question.  In <em>Shaare Tefila Congregation</em> v. <em>Cobb,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/615/index.html">481 U. S. 615</a> (1987), we decided the narrow question whether Jews are a separate and protected race under \xc2\xa71982.  <em>Id.</em>, at 618.  Similarly, in <em>Runyon,</em> <em>supra</em>, the arguments and the opinion addressed \xe2\x80\x9conly two basic questions: whether \xc2\xa71981 prohibits private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are Negroes, and, if so, whether that federal law is constitutional as so applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 168 (footnote omitted).  And in <em>Goodman</em> v. <em>Lukens Steel Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/656/index.html">482 U. S. 656</a> (1987), we decided only the two contested issues: that \xc2\xa71981 was subject to the state personal injury limitations period, <em>id.</em>, at 660\xe2\x80\x93664, and that it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \xc2\xa71981 for a union to decline to press black employees\xe2\x80\x99 grievances under the governing collective-bargaining agreement, <em>id.</em>, at 669.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court often grants certiorari to decide particular legal issues while assuming without deciding the validity of antecedent propositions, and such assumptions\xe2\x80\x94even on jurisdictional issues\xe2\x80\x94are not binding in future cases that directly raise the questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/259/index.html">494 U. S. 259</a>, 272 (1990) (citations omitted).      </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0McDonald resorts finally to policy arguments.  Unless his reading of the statute prevails, he warns, many discriminatory acts will go unpunished.  Corporations, for instance, may choose not to bring suit for the racially motivated contract breach.  It is not likely to be a common occurrence that the victim of a contract breach will forgo a potent available remedy.  Injured parties \xe2\x80\x9cusually will be the best proponents of their own rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Singleton</em> v. <em>Wulff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/index.html">428 U. S. 106</a>, 114 (1976).  And if and when \xe2\x80\x9cthe holders of those rights \xe2\x80\xa6 do not wish to assert them,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 113\xe2\x80\x93114, third parties are not normally entitled to step into their shoes.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, \xc2\xa71981 is only one of a multitude of civil rights statutes.  Many of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical examples of unpunished discrimination would in fact be reachable under Title VII\xe2\x80\x94or even under general criminal law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondent 27 (concerning a scenario in which \xe2\x80\x9cDomino\xe2\x80\x99s officials had beaten up McDonald in an attempt to intimidate him\xe2\x80\x9d).  The most important response, however, is that nothing in the text of \xc2\xa71981 suggests that it was meant to provide an omnibus remedy for <em>all </em>racial injustice.  If so, it would not have been limited to situations involving contracts.  Trying to make it a cure-all not only goes beyond any expression of congressional intent but would produce satellite \xc2\xa71981 litigation of immense scope.  McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s theory would permit class actions by all the minority employees of the nonbreaching party to a broken contract (or, for that matter, minority employees of any company failing to receive a contract award), alleging that the reason for the breach (or for the refusal to contract) was racial animus against them. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with our prior case law, and as required by the plain text of the statute, we hold that a plaintiff cannot state a claim under \xc2\xa71981 unless he has (or would have) rights under the existing (or proposed) contract that he wishes \xe2\x80\x9cto make and enforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1981 plaintiffs must identify injuries flowing from a racially motivated breach of their own contractual relationship, not of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s. <em> </em>Because the District Court correctly recognized and applied these principles, the Ninth Circuit erred in reversing its judgment.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is accordingly</p>\n<p align="left">Reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Since JWM settled its claims and is not involved in this case, we have no occasion to determine whether, as a corporation, it <em>could </em>have brought suit under \xc2\xa71981.  We note, however, that the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have concluded that corporations may raise \xc2\xa71981 claims.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hudson Valley Freedom Theater, Inc.</em> v. <em>Heimbach</em>, 671 F.\xc2\xa02d 702, 706 (CA2 1982).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpepperoni salesman\xe2\x80\x9d analogy is imprecise.  It would better parallel the facts here if the analogy had been to a salesman unable to collect on accounts receivable because he was black, rather than to one who was unable to make the contract in the first place.  The fundamental point, however, is the same: An individual seeking to make <em>or </em>enforce a contract under which he has rights will have a claim under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981, while one seeking to make <em>or </em>enforce a contract under which someone else has rights will not.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We say \xe2\x80\x9cunder which the plaintiff has rights\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cto which the plaintiff is a party\xe2\x80\x9d because we do not mean to exclude the possibility that a third-party intended beneficiary of a contract may have rights under \xc2\xa71981.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7304, p. 448 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cA promise in a contract creates a duty in the promisor to any intended beneficiary to perform the promise, and the intended beneficiary may enforce the duty\xe2\x80\x9d).  Neither do we mean to affirm that possibility.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Blessing</em> v. <em>Freestone,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/index.html">520 U. S. 329</a>, 349 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cUntil relatively recent times, the third-party beneficiary was generally regarded as a stranger to the contract, and could not sue upon it\xe2\x80\x9d).   The issue is not before us here, McDonald having made no such claim.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0McDonald also argues in his merits brief (for the first time) that we should affirm the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment because Domino\xe2\x80\x99s interfered with McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s own contracts with JWM.  Counsel for McDonald asserted at oral argument that this contention is not a new argument (see this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2), but is a \xe2\x80\x9csort of formulatio[n] of the same argument\xe2\x80\x9d that he had properly raised.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  As such, it fails for the same reasons that the argument fails in its original incarnation.  McDonald acknowledges that JWM did not breach any contractual obligation to him, see Brief for Respondent 44, and so any injury he may have received still derived from impairment of the contractual relationship between JWM and Domino\xe2\x80\x99s, under which McDonald has no rights.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
