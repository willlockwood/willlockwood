This, of course, did not include a note for $1,000, which had been paid five months before the proceedings in bankruptcy.

The court, however, held that the general creditors were entitled to have the plant of the York Manufacturing Company sold for the payment of their claims because of the failure of that company to file the conditional sale contract, as required by the Ohio statute, and such failure rendered the contract void as to the creditors.

S. 350</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question is simply whether the York Manufacturing Company has a right, under its conditional sale of the machinery to the bankrupt corporation, to take the machinery out of the premises where it was placed, as against all except judgment or other creditors by some specific lien.  There are no judgment creditors in the case, and no attachment has been levied, and the question is simply whether the adjudication in bankruptcy is equivalent to a judgment or an attachment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 201 U. S. 351</a></p><p> on the property, so as to prevent the York Manufacturing Company from asserting its right to remove the machinery by virtue of the reservation of title contained in its contract.</p>\n<p>In <em>Wilson v. Leslie,</em> 20 Ohio, 161, the court was construing the language of the statute relating to chattel mortgages, which declared a mortgage absolutely void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage or a true copy thereof should be deposited forthwith, as directed in the act.  The court held that the mortgage was not void for lack of filing, as between the parties thereto, but that the statute only avoided the instrument as to those creditors who, between the time of the execution of the mortgage and the filing thereof, had taken steps to "fasten upon the property for the payment of their debts."  As against such as had in the interim secured liens by attachment, execution, or otherwise, the mortgage would be void.  When filed with the recorder, the instrument became valid as against all persons except those whose rights have attached upon the property before the recording of the instrument.  <em>See,</em> to the same effect, <em>In re Shirley,</em> 112 F. 301.</p>\n<p>We have not been referred to any decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio as to the meaning of the statute requiring the filing of contracts of conditional sales, but we concur with the circuit court of appeals in this case that the statute would render the unfiled contract void as to the same class of creditors mentioned in the chattel mortgage statute.  Therefore the contract would be void as to creditors who, before its filing, had "fastened upon the property" by some specific liens.  As to creditors who had no such lien, being general creditors only, the statute does not avoid the sale, which is good between the parties to the contract.</p>\n<p>The mortgage of Waight &amp; Ames cannot be a lien on the machinery sold by the York Manufacturing Company, because the mortgage was prior to the time when any portion of such machinery was placed upon the land.  There was no clause in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 201 U. S. 352</a></p><p> the mortgage covering after-acquired property, and, in any event, the mortgage would not cover property so acquired, the title to which, as in this case, was reserved to the vendor.  This was the ruling of the district court, and no appeal was taken therefrom by the mortgagees.  There are no creditors with any specific liens, nor is there any other mortgage, and there is no attachment.</p>\n<p>We come, then, to the question whether the adjudication in bankruptcy was equivalent to a judgment, attachment, or other specific lien upon the machinery.  The circuit court of appeals has held herein that the seizure by the court of bankruptcy operated as an attachment and an injunction for the benefit of all persons having interests in the bankrupt\'s estate.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that it did not operate as a lien upon the machinery as against the York Manufacturing Company, the vendor thereof.  Under the provisions of the Bankrupt Act, the trustee in bankruptcy is vested with no better right or title to the bankrupt\'s property than belonged to the bankrupt at the time when the trustee\'s title accrued.  At that time, the right, as between the bankrupt and the York Manufacturing Company, was in the latter company to take the machinery on account of default in the payment therefor.  The trustee, under such circumstances, stands simply in the shoes of the bankrupt, and, as between them, he has no greater right than the bankrupt.  This is held in <em>Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/296/case.html">194 U. S. 296</a></span>.  The same view was taken in <em>Thompson v. Fairbanks,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/196/516/case.html">196 U. S. 516</a></span>.  It was there stated that,</p>\n<p>"under the present Bankrupt Act, the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt, in cases unaffected by fraud, in the same plight and condition that the bankrupt himself held it, and subject to all the equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt."</p>\n<p><em>See Yeatman v. Savings Institution,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/95/764/case.html">95 U. S. 764</a></span>; <em>Stewart v. Platt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/731/case.html">101 U. S. 731</a></span>; <em>Hauselt v. Harrison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/401/case.html">105 U. S. 401</a></span>.  The same doctrine was reaffirmed in <em>Humphrey v. Tatman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/91/case.html">198 U. S. 91</a></span>.  The law of Ohio says the conditional sale contract was good between the parties, although not filed.  In such a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 201 U. S. 353</a></p><p> case, the trustee in bankruptcy takes only the rights of the bankrupt, where there are no specific liens, as already stated.</p>\n<p>The remark made in <em>Mueller v. Nugent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/184/1/case.html">184 U. S. 1</a></span>, "that the filing of the petition [in bankruptcy] is a caveat to all the world, and in effect an attachment and injunction" was made in regard to the particular facts in that case.  The case itself raised questions entirely foreign to the one herein arising, and did not involve any inquiry into the title of a trustee in bankruptcy as between himself and the bankrupt, under such facts as are above stated.  The dispute in the <em>Mueller</em> case was whether the court in bankruptcy had power to compel, in a summary way, the surrender of money or other property of the bankrupt, in the possession of the bankrupt, or of someone for him, without resorting to a suit for that purpose.  This Court held, as stated by the Chief Justice in delivering its opinion:</p>\n<p>"The bankruptcy court would be helpless indeed if the bare refusal to turn over could conclusively operate to drive the trustee to an action to recover as for an indebtedness or a conversion, or to proceedings in chancery at the risk of the accompaniments of delay, complication, and expense intended to be avoided by the simpler methods of the bankrupt law."</p>\n<p>It was held that the trustee was not thus bound, but had the right, under the facts in that case, to proceed under the bankrupt law itself and take the property out of the hands of the bankrupt or anyone holding it for him.</p>\n<p>In this case, under the authorities already cited, the York Manufacturing Company had the right, as between itself and the trustee in bankruptcy, to take the property under the unfiled contract with the bankrupt, and the adjudication in bankruptcy did not operate as a lien upon this machinery in favor of the trustee as against the York Manufacturing Company.</p>\n<p>The decree of the circuit court of appeals is reversed, and the case remanded to the district court, with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>* Section 4155, Revised Statutes of Ohio, provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"In all cases where any personal property shall be sold to any person, to be paid for in whole or in part in installments, or shall be leased, rented, hired, or delivered to another on condition that the same shall belong to the person purchasing, leasing, renting, hiring, or receiving the same whenever the amount paid shall be a certain sum, or the value of such property, the title to the same to remain in the vendor, lessor, renter, hirer, or deliverer of the same, until such sum or the value of such property or any part thereof shall have been paid, such condition, in regard to the title so remaining until such payment, shall be void as to all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, and creditors, unless such condition shall be evidenced by writing signed by the purchasers, lessor, renter, hirer, or receiver of the same, and also a statement thereon, under oath, made by the person so selling, leasing, or delivering any property as herein provided, his agent or attorney, of the amount of the claim, or a true copy thereof, with an affidavit that the same is a copy, deposited with the clerk of the township where the person signing the instrument resides at the time of the execution thereof, if a resident of the state, and if not such resident, then with the clerk of the township in which such property is sold, leased, rented, hired, or delivered is situated at the time of the execution of the instrument; but when the person executing the instrument is a resident of a township in which the office of county recorder is kept, or when be is a nonresident of the state, and the property is within such township, the instrument shall be filed with the county recorder, and the officer receiving any such instrument shall proceed with the same in all respects as he is required to do by section four thousand one hundred and fifty-two of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, and shall receive the same fees as are allowed by law for similar services in other cases."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
