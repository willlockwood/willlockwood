AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931693.Argued March 2, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 27, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) et\xc2\xa0al., sued under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that they violated the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause.  The Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s<font b="1"> \xe2\x80\x9cprecedent legal code.\xe2\x80\x9d  The resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position, including the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment of Christ as the \xe2\x80\x9cPrince of Ethics.\xe2\x80\x9d  The displays around the Commandments were modified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing religious references as their sole common element, <em>e.g.,</em> the Declaration of Independence\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cendowed by their Creator\xe2\x80\x9d passage.  Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court followed the <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/index.html">403 U. S. 602</a>, test to find, <em>inter alia</em>, that the original display lacked any secular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious document, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational documents to those specifically referring to Christianity.  After changing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again.  No new resolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded the second one.  The new posting, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Foundations of American Law and Government Display,\xe2\x80\x9d consists of nine framed documents of equal size.  One sets out the Commandments explicitly identified as the \xe2\x80\x9cKing James Version,\xe2\x80\x9d quotes them at greater length, and explains that they have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and this Nation.  With the Commandments are framed copies of, <em>e.g.,</em> the Star Spangled Banner\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics and the Declaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their historical and legal significance.  On the ACLU\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the District Court included this third display in the injunction despite the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government and to educate County citizens as to the documents.  The court took proclaiming the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 foundational value as a religious, rather than secular, purpose under <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a>, and found that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 asserted educational goals crumbled upon an examination of this litigation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under <em>Stone</em>, displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated with a secular message.  The court saw no integration here because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection between the Commandments and the other documents.  </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0A determination of the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complaints.

S. 38</a>, 75.  When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates the central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the government\xe2\x80\x99s ostensible object is to take sides.  <em>Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&amp;nbhyph;day Saints</em> v. <em>Amos,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/327/index.html">483 U. S. 327</a>, 335.  A purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion generally, clashes with the \xe2\x80\x9cunderstanding \xe2\x80\xa6 that liberty and social stability demand a \xe2\x80\xa6 tolerance that respects the religious views of all citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U.

Their assertions that true \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent, are as seismic as they are unconvincing.  Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation for every American appellate court, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cline,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/581/index.html">540 U. S. 581</a>, 600, and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitutional doctrine, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Davis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/index.html">426 U. S. 229</a>.  Scrutinizing purpose makes practical sense in Establishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily discoverable fact set forth in a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, legislative history, and implementation or comparable official act.  <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree, </em>472 U. S., at 73\xe2\x80\x9374.  Nor is there any indication that the purpose enquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every time a case is filed.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court also avoids the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 alternative tack of trivializing the purpose enquiry.  They would read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases as if the enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually had on the significance of current circumstances.  There is no precedent for these arguments, or reason supporting them.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0A legislature\xe2\x80\x99s stated reasons will generally warrant the deference owed in the first instance to such official claims, but <em>Lemon</em> requires the secular purpose to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective, see, <em>e.g., Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/290/index.html">530 U. S. 290</a>, 308.  In those unusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising results have been findings of no adequate secular object, as against a predominantly religious one.  See<em>, e.g., Stone, supra</em>, at 41.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 argument that purpose in a case like this should be inferred only from the latest in a series of governmental actions, however close they may all be in time and subject, bucks common sense.  Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents sensibly forbid an observer \xe2\x80\x9cto turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe, supra</em>, at 315.

The development of the presentation should be considered in determining its purpose.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Stone </em>is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s initial benchmark as its only case dealing with the constitutionality of displaying the Commandments.  It recognized that the Commandments are an \xe2\x80\x9cinstrument of religion\xe2\x80\x9d and that, at least on the facts before the Court, their text\xe2\x80\x99s display could presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secular education explained their being there.  449 U. S., at 41, n.\xc2\xa03.  But <em>Stone</em> did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible way the government might set out the Commandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 595.  Hence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression leading up to the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 third display, beginning with the first.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0There<em> </em>are two obvious similarities between the display <em>Stone </em>rejected and the first one here: both set out the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 text as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation like blank tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an arguably secular display.  <em>Stone</em> stressed the significance of integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point of reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and Christians.  They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods), regulate details of religious obligation (no graven images, sabbath breaking, or vain oath swearing), and unmistakably rest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, theft, etc.) on the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the text\xe2\x80\x99s beginning.  Displaying that text is thus different from symbolic representation, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a sectarian conception of faith.<font b="1">  Where the text is set out, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly suggesting a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view.  The display in <em>Stone</em> had no such context, and the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 solo exhibit here did nothing more to counter the sectarian implication than the <em>Stone</em> postings.  The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 religious message.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 second display, unlike the first, did not hang the Commandments in isolation, but included the statement of the government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose expressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the Commandments to other documents whose references to God were highlighted as their sole common element.  The display\xe2\x80\x99s unstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the Counties posted the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content.  That demonstration of the government\xe2\x80\x99s objective was enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying resolutions\xe2\x80\x99 claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ.  Together, the display and resolution presented an indisputable, and undisputed, showing of an impermissible purpose.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that no legitimizing secular purpose prompted the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 third display, the \xe2\x80\x9cFoundations of American Law and Government\xe2\x80\x9d exhibit, is amply justified.  That display placed the Commandments in the company of other documents the Counties deemed especially significant in the historical foundation of American government.  In trying to persuade the District Court to lift the preliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new purposes for the third version, including a desire to educate County citizens as to the significance of the documents displayed.  The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 claims, however, persuaded neither that court, which was intimately familiar with this litigation\xe2\x80\x99s details, nor the Sixth Circuit.  Where both lower courts were unable to discern an arguably valid secular purpose, this Court normally should hesitate to find one.  <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Aguillard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/578/index.html">482 U. S. 578</a>, 594.  The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigating position, there being no further authorizing resolutions by the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 governing boards.  And although repeal of the earlier county authorizations would not have erased them from the record of evidence bearing on current purpose, the extraordinary resolutions for the second displays passed just months earlier were not repealed or otherwise repudiated.  Indeed, the sectarian spirit of the resolutions found enhanced expression in the third display, which quoted more of the Commandment\xe2\x80\x99s purely religious language than the first two displays had done.  No reasonable observer, therefore, could accept the claim that the Counties had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.  Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might prevail over evidence of the continuing religious object.  For example, it is at least odd in a collection of documents said to be \xe2\x80\x9cfoundational\xe2\x80\x9d to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most significant structural provision adopted since the original framing.  An observer would probably suspect the Counties of reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0In holding that the preliminary injunction was adequately supported by evidence that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 purpose had not changed at the third stage, the Court does not decide that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 past actions forever taint any effort on their part to deal with the subject matter.  The Court holds only that purpose is to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and is to be understood in light of context.  District courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief to take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant conditions.  Nor does the Court hold that a sacred text can never be integrated constitutionally into a governmental display on law or history.  Its own courtroom frieze depicts Moses holding tablets exhibiting a portion of the secularly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the National Government was violating religious neutrality.

In addition to the first display\xe2\x80\x99s large framed copy of the edited King James version of the Commandments,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the second included eight other documents in smaller frames, each either having a religious theme or excerpted to highlight a religious element.

The judges in the majority understood the identical displays to emphasize \xe2\x80\x9ca single religious influence, with no mention of any other religious or secular influences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 454, and they took the very history of the litigation as evidence of the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 religious objective, <em>id.,</em> at 457.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Ryan dissented on the basis of wide recognition that religion, and the Ten Commandments in particular, have played a foundational part in the evolution of American law and government; he saw no reason to gainsay the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 claim of secular purposes.  <em>Id.,</em> at 472\xe2\x80\x93473.

Their first argument is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to them, true \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent.

With enquiries into purpose this common, if they were nothing but hunts for mares\xe2\x80\x99 nests deflecting attention from bare judicial will, the whole notion of purpose in law would have dropped into disrepute long ago.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense, as in Establishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\xe2\x80\x99s heart of hearts.  <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree, supra,</em> at 74 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).

There is, then, nothing hinting at an unpredictable or disingenuous exercise when a court enquires into purpose after a claim is raised under the Establishment Clause.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases with findings of a predominantly religious purpose point to the straightforward nature of the test.  In <em>Wallace</em>, for example, we inferred purpose from a change of wording from an earlier statute to a later one, each dealing with prayer in schools.  472 U. S., at 58\xe2\x80\x9360.  And in <em>Edwards</em>, we relied on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and the detailed public comments of its sponsor, when we sought the purpose of a state law requiring creationism to be taught alongside evolution.  482 U. S., at 586\xe2\x80\x93588.  In other cases, the government action itself bespoke the purpose, as in <em>Abington</em>, where the object of required Bible study in public schools was patently religious, 374 U. S., at 223\xe2\x80\x93224; in <em>Stone</em>, the Court held that the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]osting of religious texts on the wall serve[d] no \xe2\x80\xa6 educational function,\xe2\x80\x9d and found that if \xe2\x80\x9cthe posted copies of the Ten Commandments [were] to have any effect at all, it [would] be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S., at 42.  In each case, the government\xe2\x80\x99s action was held unconstitutional only because openly available data supported a commonsense conclusion that a religious objective permeated the government\xe2\x80\x99s action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any indication that the enquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every time a case is filed.  In the past, the test has not been fatal very often, presumably because government does not generally act unconstitutionally, with the predominant purpose of advancing religion.  That said, one consequence of the corollary that Establishment Clause analysis does not look to the veiled psyche of government officers could be that in some of the cases in which establishment complaints failed, savvy officials had disguised their religious intent so cleverly that the objective observer just missed it.  But that is no reason for great constitutional concern.  If someone in the government hides religious motive so well that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective observer, acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Santa Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em>530 U. S., at 308 (quoting <em>Wallace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 73) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment)), cannot see it, then without something more the government does not make a divisive announcement that in itself amounts to taking religious sides.  A secret motive stirs up no strife and does nothing to make outsiders of nonadherents, and it suffices to wait and see whether such government action turns out to have (as it may even be likely to have) the illegitimate effect of advancing religion.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After declining the invitation to abandon concern with purpose wholesale, we also have to avoid the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 alternative tack of trivializing the enquiry into it.  The Counties would read the cases as if the purpose enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually had on the significance of current circumstances.  There is no precedent for the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, or reason supporting them.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lemon</em> said that government action must have \xe2\x80\x9ca secular \xe2\x80\xa6 purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d 403 U. S., at 612, and after a host of cases it is fair to add that although a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s stated reasons will generally get deference, the secular purpose required has to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, supra,</em> at 308 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a governmental entity professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious policy, the government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization is, of course, entitled to some deference.  But it is nonetheless the duty of the courts to \xe2\x80\x98distinguis[h] a sham secular purpose from a sincere one\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Edwards,</em> 482 U.

True, <em>Wallace</em> said government action is tainted by its object \xe2\x80\x9cif it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion,\xe2\x80\x9d 472 U. S., at 56, a remark that suggests, in isolation, a fairly complaisant attitude.  But in that very case the Court declined to credit Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s stated secular rationale of \xe2\x80\x9caccommodation\xe2\x80\x9d for legislation authorizing a period of silence in school for meditation or voluntary prayer, given the implausibility of that explanation in light of another statute already accommodating children wishing to pray.  <em>Id.,</em> at 57, n. 45 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it would be just as much a mistake to infer that a timid standard underlies the statement in <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly</em> that the purpose enquiry looks to whether government \xe2\x80\x9cactivity was motivated wholly by religious considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d 465 U. S., at 680; for two cases cited for that proposition had examined and rejected claims of secular purposes that turned out to be implausible or inadequate:[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] <em>Stone,</em> 449 U.

But in those unusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising results have been findings of no adequate secular object, as against a predominantly religious one.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 second proffered limitation can be dispatched quickly.  They argue that purpose in a case like this one should be inferred, if at all, only from the latest news about the last in a series of governmental actions, however close they may all be in time and subject.  But the world is not made brand new every morning, and the Counties are simply asking us to ignore perfectly probative evidence; they want an absentminded objective observer, not one presumed to be familiar with the history of the government\xe2\x80\x99s actions and competent to learn what history has to show,  <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em>530 U.

S., at 41, n.\xc2\xa03 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But <em>Stone</em> did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible way the Commandments might be set out by the government, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key.  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 595 (1989) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he question is what viewers may fairly understand to be the purpose of the display.  That inquiry, of necessity, turns upon the context in which the contested object appears\xe2\x80\x9d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Hence, we look to the record of evidence showing the progression leading up to the third display of the Commandments.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The display rejected in <em>Stone</em> had two obvious similarities to the first one in the sequence here: both set out a text of the Commandments as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation, and each stood alone, not part of an arguably secular display.  <em>Stone</em> stressed the significance of integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, <em>supra</em>, at 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point of reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and Christians. They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods).  They regulate details of religious obligation (no graven images, no sabbath breaking, no vain oath swearing).  And they unmistakably rest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, theft, and the like) on the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the beginning of the text.  Displaying that text is thus different from a symbolic depiction, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a sectarian conception of faith.<font b="1">  Where the text is set out, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly suggesting a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view.  The display in <em>Stone</em> had no context that might have indicated an object beyond the religious character of the text, and the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 solo exhibit here did nothing more to counter the sectarian implication than the postings at issue in <em>Stone</em>.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  See also <em>County of Allegheny, supra</em>, at 598 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, unlike in <em>Lynch</em> [v. <em>Donnelly</em>], nothing in the context of the display detracts from the cr\xc4\x8dche\xe2\x80\x99s religious message\xe2\x80\x9d).  Actually, the posting by the Counties lacked even the <em>Stone</em> display\xe2\x80\x99s implausible disclaimer that the Commandments were set out to show their effect on the civil law.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  What is more, at the ceremony for posting the framed Commandments in Pulaski County, the county executive was accompanied by his pastor, who testified to the certainty of the existence of God.  The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 religious message.<font super="1"> </font></font></p><font b="1"><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to deny that the Commandments have had influence on civil or secular law; a major text of a majority religion is bound to be felt.  The point is simply that the original text viewed in its entirety is an unmistakably religious statement dealing with religious obligations and with morality subject to religious sanction.  When the government initiates an effort to place this statement alone in public view, a religious object is unmistakable.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once the Counties were sued, they modified the exhibits and invited additional insight into their purpose in a display that hung for about six months.  This new one was the product of forthright and nearly identical Pulaski and McCreary County resolutions listing a series of American historical documents with theistic and Christian references, which were to be posted in order to furnish a setting for displaying the Ten Commandments and any \xe2\x80\x9cother Kentucky and American historical documen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d without raising concern about \xe2\x80\x9cany Christian or religious references\xe2\x80\x9d in them.  Def. Exh. 1, at\xc2\xa01.  As mentioned, the resolutions expressed support for an Alabama judge who posted the Commandments in his courtroom, and cited the fact the Kentucky Legislature once adjourned a session in honor of \xe2\x80\x9cJesus Christ, Prince of Ethics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this second display, unlike the first, the Commandments were not hung in isolation, merely leaving the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to emerge from the pervasively religious text of the Commandments themselves.  Instead, the second version was required to include the statement of the government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose expressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the Commandments to other documents with highlighted references to God as their sole common element.  The display\xe2\x80\x99s unstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the Counties were posting the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content.  That demonstration of the government\xe2\x80\x99s objective was enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying resolution\xe2\x80\x99s claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ.  Together, the display and resolution presented an indisputable, and undisputed, showing of an impermissible purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Counties make no attempt to defend their undeniable objective, but instead hopefully describe version two as \xe2\x80\x9cdead and buried.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 15.  Their refusal to defend the second display is understandable, but the reasonable observer could not forget it.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Counties changed lawyers, they mounted a third display, without a new resolution or repeal of the old one.  The result was the \xe2\x80\x9cFoundations of American Law and Government\xe2\x80\x9d exhibit, which placed the Commandments in the company of other documents the Counties thought especially significant in the historical foundation of American government<font b="1">.  In trying to persuade the District Court to lift the preliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new purposes for the third version, including a desire \xe2\x80\x9cto educate the citizens of the county regarding some of the documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  145 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 848 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 claims did not, however, persuade the court, intimately familiar with the details of this litigation, or the Court of Appeals, neither of which found a legitimizing secular purpose in this third version of the display. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98When both courts [that have already passed on the case] are unable to discern an arguably valid secular purpose, this Court normally should hesitate to find one.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edwards,</em> 482 U. S., at 594, n. 15 (quoting <em>Wallace,</em> 472 U. S., at 66 (Powell, J., concurring)).  The conclusions of the two courts preceding us in this case are well warranted.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigating position, there being no further authorizing action by the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 governing boards.  And although repeal of the earlier county authorizations would not have erased them from the record of evidence bearing on current purpose,[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] the extraordinary resolutions for the second display passed just months earlier were not repealed or otherwise repudiated.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Indeed, the sectarian spirit of the common resolution found enhanced expression in the third display, which quoted more of the purely religious language of the Commandments than the first two displays had done; for additions, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a (\xe2\x80\x9cI the LORD thy God am a jealous God\xe2\x80\x9d) (text of Second Commandment in third display); (\xe2\x80\x9cthe LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain\xe2\x80\x9d) (from text of Third Commandment); and (\xe2\x80\x9cthat thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee\xe2\x80\x9d) (text of Fifth Commandment).  No reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Counties had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might prevail over evidence of the continuing religious object.  In a collection of documents said to be \xe2\x80\x9cfoundational\xe2\x80\x9d to American government, it is at least odd to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most significant structural provision adopted since the original Framing.  And it is no less baffling to leave out the original Constitution of 1787 while quoting the 1215 Magna Carta even to the point of its declaration that \xe2\x80\x9cfish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 205a, \xc2\xb633.  If an observer found these choices and omissions perplexing in isolation, he would be puzzled for a different reason when he read the Declaration of Independence seeking confirmation for the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 posted explanation that the \xe2\x80\x9cTen Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 influence is clearly seen in the Declaration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 180a; in fact the observer would find that the Commandments are sanctioned as divine imperatives, while the Declaration of Independence holds that the authority of government to enforce the law derives \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the consent of the governed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 190a.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  If the observer had not thrown up his hands, he would probably suspect that the Counties were simply reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding the preliminary injunction adequately supported by evidence that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 purpose had not changed at the third stage, we do not decide that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 past actions forever taint any effort on their part to deal with the subject matter.  We hold only that purpose needs to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and needs to be understood in light of context; an implausible claim that governmental purpose has changed should not carry the day in a court of law any more than in a head with common sense.  It is enough to say here that district courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief to take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant conditions.  See <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/656/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/656/index.html">542 U.

We do not forget, and in this litigation have frequently been reminded, that our own courtroom frieze was deliberately designed in the exercise of<font b="1"> governmental authority so as to include the figure of Moses holding tablets exhibiting a portion of the Hebrew text of the later, secularly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the National Government was violating neutrality in religion.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of neutrality as an interpretive guide is no less true now than it was when the Court broached the principle in <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/330/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/330/1/index.html">330 U.

The First Amendment contains no textual definition of \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment,\xe2\x80\x9d and the term is certainly not self-defining.  No one contends that the prohibition of establishment stops at a designation of a national (or with Fourteenth Amendment incorporation, <em>Cantwell</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/index.html">310 U. S. 296</a>, 303 (1940), a state) church, but nothing in the text says just how much more it covers.  There is no simple answer, for more than one reason.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prohibition on establishment covers a variety of issues from prayer in widely varying government settings, to financial aid for religious individuals and institutions, to comment on religious questions.  In these varied settings, issues of about interpreting inexact Establishment Clause language, like difficult interpretative issues generally, arise from the tension of competing values, each constitutionally respectable, but none open to realization to the logical limit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment has not one but two clauses tied to \xe2\x80\x9creligion,\xe2\x80\x9d the second forbidding any prohibition on the \xe2\x80\x9cthe free exercise thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes, the two clauses compete: spending government money on the clergy looks like establishing religion, but if the government cannot pay for military chaplains a good many soldiers and sailors would be kept from the opportunity to exercise their chosen religions.  See <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, 544 U. S. ___,  ___ (2005) (slip. op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  At other times, limits on governmental action that might make sense as a way to avoid establishment could arguably limit freedom of speech when the speaking is done under government auspices.  <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U.

The principle has been helpful simply because it responds to one of the major concerns that prompted adoption of the Religion Clauses.  The Framers and the citizens of their time intended not only to protect the integrity of individual conscience in religious matters, <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> 472 U. S., at 52\xe2\x80\x9354, and n.\xc2\xa038, but to guard against the civic divisiveness that follows when the Government weighs in on one side of religious debate; nothing does a better job of roiling society, a point that needed no explanation to the descendants of English Puritans and Cavaliers (or Massachusetts Puritans and Baptists).  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Everson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cA large proportion of the early settlers of this country came here from Europe to escape [religious persecution]\xe2\x80\x9d).  A sense of the past thus points to governmental neutrality as an objective of the Establishment Clause, and a sensible standard for applying it.  To be sure, given its generality as a principle, an appeal to neutrality alone cannot possibly lay every issue to rest, or tell us what issues on the margins are substantial enough for constitutional significance, a point that has been clear from the Founding era to modern times.  <em>E.g.</em>, Letter from J. Madison to R. Adams (1832), in 5 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution at 107 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[In calling for separation] I must admit moreover that it may not be easy, in every possible case, to trace the line of separation between the rights of religion and the Civil authority with such distinctness as to avoid collisions &amp; doubts on unessential points\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Sherbert</em> v. <em>Verner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/index.html">374 U.

But invoking neutrality is a prudent way of keeping sight of something the Framers of the First Amendment thought important.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent, however, puts forward a limitation on the application of the neutrality principle, with citations to historical evidence said to show that the Framers understood the ban on establishment of religion as sufficiently narrow to allow the government to espouse submission to the divine will.  The dissent identifies God as the God of monotheism, all of whose three principal strains (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) acknowledge the religious importance of the Ten Commandments.  <em>Post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  On the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, it apparently follows that even rigorous espousal of a common element of this common monotheism, is consistent with the establishment ban.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument for the original understanding is flawed from the outset by its failure to consider the full range of evidence showing what the Framers believed.  The dissent is certainly correct in putting forward evidence that some of the Framers thought some endorsement of religion was compatible with the establishment ban; the dissent quotes the first President as stating that \xe2\x80\x9cnational morality [cannot] prevail in exclusion of religious principle,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, <em>post</em>, at 3, and it cites his first Thanksgiving proclamation giving thanks to God, <em>post</em>, at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Surely if expressions like these from Washington and his contemporaries were all we had to go on, there would be a good case that the neutrality principle has the effect of broadening the ban on establishment beyond the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of it (although there would, of course, still be the question of whether the historical case could overcome some 60 years of precedent taking neutrality as its guiding principle).[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the fact is that we do have more to go on, for there is also evidence supporting the proposition that the Framers intended the Establishment Clause to require governmental neutrality in matters of religion, including neutrality in statements acknowledging religion.  The very language of the Establishment Clause represented a significant departure from early drafts that merely prohibited a single national religion, and, the final language instead \xe2\x80\x9cextended [the] prohibition to state support for \xe2\x80\x98religion\xe2\x80\x99 in general.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U.

Jefferson, for example, refused to issue Thanksgiving Proclamations because he believed that they violated the Constitution.  See Letter to S. Miller (Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution at 98.  And Madison, whom the dissent claims as supporting its thesis, <em>post</em>, at 4, criticized Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s general assessment tax not just because it required people to donate \xe2\x80\x9cthree pence\xe2\x80\x9d to religion, but because \xe2\x80\x9cit is itself a signal of persecution.  It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 622 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution, at 106 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eligion &amp; Govt. will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together\xe2\x80\x9d); Letter from J. Madison to J. Adams (Sept. 1833) in Religion and Politics in the Early Republic 120 (D. Dresibach ed. 1996) (stating that with respect to religion and government the \xe2\x80\x9ctendency to a usurpation on one side, or the other, or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them, will be best guarded against by an entire abstinence of the Government from interference\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, 545 U.

What the evidence does show is a group of statesmen, like others before and after them, who proposed a guarantee with contours not wholly worked out, leaving the Establishment Clause with edges still to be determined.  And none the worse for that.  Indeterminate edges are the kind to have in a constitution meant to endure, and to meet \xe2\x80\x9cexigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for as they occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the dissent fails to show a consistent original understanding from which to argue that the neutrality principle should be rejected, it does manage to deliver a surprise.  As mentioned, the dissent says that the deity the Framers had in mind was the God of monotheism, with the consequence that government may espouse a tenet of traditional monotheism. <font b="1"> This is truly a remarkable view.  Other members of the Court have dissented on the ground that the Establishment Clause bars nothing more than governmental preference for one religion over another, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> 472 U. S., at 98\xe2\x80\x9399 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), but at least religion has previously been treated inclusively.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, however, apparently means that government should be free to approve the core beliefs of a favored religion over the tenets of others, a view that should trouble anyone who prizes religious liberty.  Certainly history cannot justify it; on the contrary, history shows that the religion of concern to the Framers was not that of the monotheistic faiths generally, but Christianity in particular, a fact that no member of this Court takes as a premise for construing the Religion Clauses.  Justice Story probably reflected the thinking of the framing generation when he wrote in his Commentaries that the purpose of the Clause was \xe2\x80\x9cnot to countenance, much less to advance, Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Cord, Separation of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 13 (1988) (emphasis omitted).  The Framers would, therefore, almost certainly object to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s unstated reasoning that because Christianity was a monotheistic \xe2\x80\x9creligion,\xe2\x80\x9d monotheism with Mosaic antecedents should be a touchstone of establishment interpretation.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Even on originalist critiques of existing precedent there is, it seems, no escape from interpretative consequences that would surprise the Framers.  Thus, it appears to be common ground in the interpretation of a Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cintended to endure for ages to come,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 415, that applications unanticipated by the Framers are inevitable.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historical evidence thus supports no solid argument for changing course (whatever force the argument might have when directed at the existing precedent), whereas public discourse at the present time certainly raises no doubt about the value of the interpretative approach invoked for 60 years now.  We are centuries away from the St. Bartholomew\xe2\x80\x99s Day massacre and the treatment of heretics in early Massachusetts, but the divisiveness of religion in current public life is inescapable.  This is no time to deny the prudence of understanding the Establishment Clause to require the Government to stay neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of the individual.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the ample support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a predominantly religious purpose behind the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 third display, we affirm the Sixth Circuit in upholding the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not consider here a display of the Ten Commandments in schoolrooms in Harlan County, Kentucky, that was litigated in consolidated proceedings in the District Court and Court of Appeals.

Leaving aside the fact that this position is inconsistent with the language of the cases just discussed, it would leave the purpose test with no real bite, given the ease of finding some secular purpose for almost any government action.

See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.

The First Amendment expresses our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental commitment to religious liberty by means of two provisions\xe2\x80\x94one protecting the free exercise of religion, the other barring establishment of religion.  They were written by the descendents of people who had come to this land precisely so that they could practice their religion freely.  Together with the other First Amendment guarantees\xe2\x80\x94of free speech, a free press, and the rights to assemble and petition\xe2\x80\x94the Religion Clauses were designed to safeguard the freedom of conscience and belief that those immigrants had sought.  They embody an idea that was once considered radical: Free people are entitled to free and diverse thoughts, which government ought neither to constrain nor to direct.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reasonable minds can disagree about how to apply the Religion Clauses in a given case.  But the goal of the Clauses is clear: to carry out the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 plan of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.  By enforcing the Clauses, we have kept religion a matter for the individual conscience, not for the prosecutor or bureaucrat.  At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the assumption of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish.  The well-known statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e are a religious people,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zorach</em> v. <em>Clauson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/index.html">343 U. S. 306</a>, 313 (1952), has proved true.  Americans attend their places of worship more often than do citizens of other developed nations, R. Fowler, A. Hertzke, &amp; L. Olson, Religion and Politics in America 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (2d ed. 1999), and describe religion as playing an especially important role in their lives, Pew Global Attitudes Project, Among Wealthy Nations U. S.  Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion (Dec. 19, 2002).  Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our guiding principle has been James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Religion \xe2\x80\xa6 of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901) (hereinafter Memorial).  To that end, we have held that the guarantees of religious freedom protect citizens from religious incursions by the States as well as by the Federal Government.  <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html">330 U. S. 1</a>, 16 (1947); <em>Cantwell</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/index.html">310 U. S. 296</a> (1940).  Government may not coerce a person into worshiping against her will, nor prohibit her from worshiping according to it.  It may not prefer one religion over another or promote religion over nonbelief.  <em>Everson</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  It may not entangle itself with religion.  <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U. S. 664</a>, 674 (1970).  And government may not, by \xe2\x80\x9cendorsing religion or a religious practice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] adherence to religion relevant to a person\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the political community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a>, 69 (1985) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we enforce these restrictions, we do so for the same reason that guided the Framers\xe2\x80\x94respect for religion\xe2\x80\x99s special role in society.  Our Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to voluntary religious expression, and provided for the possibility of judicial intervention when government action threatens or impedes such expression.  Voluntary religious belief and expression may be as threatened when government takes the mantle of religion upon itself as when government directly interferes with private religious practices.  When the government associates one set of religious beliefs with the state and identifies nonadherents as outsiders, it encroaches upon the individual\xe2\x80\x99s decision about whether and how to worship.  In the marketplace of ideas, the government has vast resources and special status.  Government religious expression therefore risks crowding out private observance and distorting the natural interplay between competing beliefs.  Allowing government to be a potential mouthpiece for competing religious ideas risks the sort of division that might easily spill over into suppression of rival beliefs.  Tying secular and religious authority together poses risks to both.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the history of this particular display of the Ten Commandments, the Court correctly finds an Establishment Clause violation.  See <em>ante, </em>at 19\xe2\x80\x9325.  The purpose behind the counties\xe2\x80\x99 display is relevant because it conveys an unmistakable message of endorsement to the reasonable observer.  See <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 690 (1984) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that many Americans find the Commandments in accord with their personal beliefs.  But we do not count heads before enforcing the First Amendment.  See<em> West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a>, 638 (1943) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor can we accept the theory that Americans who do not accept the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 validity are outside the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections.  There is no list of approved and disapproved beliefs appended to the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x94and the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s broad terms (\xe2\x80\x9cfree exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d) do not admit of such a cramped reading.  It is true that the Framers lived at a time when our national religious diversity was neither as robust nor as well recognized as it is now.  They may not have foreseen the variety of religions for which this Nation would eventually provide a home.  They surely could not have predicted new religions, some of them born in this country.  But they did know that line-drawing between religions is an enterprise that, once begun, has no logical stopping point.  They worried that \xe2\x80\x9cthe same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorial 186.  The Religion Clauses, as a result, protect adherents of all religions, as well as those who believe in no religion at all.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We owe our First Amendment to a generation with a profound commitment to religion and a profound commitment to religious liberty\xe2\x80\x94visionaries who held their faith \xe2\x80\x9cwith enough confidence to believe that what should be rendered to God does not need to be decided and collected by Caesar.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zorach, supra,</em> at 324\xe2\x80\x93325 (Jackson, J., dissenting).  In my opinion, the display at issue was an establishment of religion in violation of our Constitution.  For the reasons given above, I join in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961883">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nMCCREARY COUNTY V.

That night and the next morning virtually all of the participants watched, in their hotel rooms, the address to the Nation by the President of the United States concerning the murderous attacks upon the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, in which thousands of Americans had been killed.  The address ended, as Presidential addresses often do, with the prayer \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless America.\xe2\x80\x9d  The next afternoon I was approached by one of the judges from a European country, who, after extending his profound condolences for my country\xe2\x80\x99s loss, sadly observed \xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish that the Head of State of my country, at a similar time of national tragedy and distress, could conclude his address \xe2\x80\x98God bless ______.\xe2\x80\x99  It is of course absolutely forbidden.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is one model of the relationship between church and state\xe2\x80\x94a model spread across Europe by the armies of Napoleon, and reflected in the Constitution of France, which begins \xe2\x80\x9cFrance is [a] . . . secular . . .

This is not, and never was, the model adopted by America.  George Washington added to the form of Presidential oath prescribed by Art. II, \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa08, of the Constitution, the concluding words \xe2\x80\x9cso help me God.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Blomquist, The Presidential Oath, the American National Interest and a Call for Presiprudence, 73 UMKC L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 34 (2004).  The Supreme Court under John Marshall opened its sessions with the prayer, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the United States and this Honorable Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History 469 (rev. ed. 1926).  The First Congress instituted the practice of beginning its legislative sessions with a prayer.  <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a>, 787 (1983).  The same week that Congress submitted the Establishment Clause as part of the Bill of Rights for ratification by the States, it enacted legislation providing for paid chaplains in the House and Senate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 788.  The day after the First Amendment was proposed, the same Congress that had proposed it requested the President to proclaim \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed, by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the many and signal favours of Almighty God.\xe2\x80\x9d  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 123 (1826 ed.); see also Sen. Jour., 1st Sess., 88 (1820 ed.).  President Washington offered the first Thanksgiving Proclamation shortly thereafter, devoting November 26, 1789 on behalf of the American people \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that is, that was, or that will be,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938<em> </em>(plurality opinion) (quoting President Washington\xe2\x80\x99s first Thanksgiving Proclamation), thus beginning a tradition of offering gratitude to God that continues today.

And of course the First Amendment itself accords religion (and no other manner of belief) special constitutional protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These actions of our First President and Congress and the Marshall Court were not idiosyncratic; they reflected the beliefs of the period.  Those who wrote the Constitution believed that morality was essential to the well-being of society and that encouragement of religion was the best way to foster morality.  The \xe2\x80\x9cfact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html">374 U.

President Washington opened his Presidency with a prayer, see Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States 1, 2 (1989), and reminded his fellow citizens at the conclusion of it that \xe2\x80\x9creason and experience both forbid us to expect that National morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Farewell Address (1796), reprinted in 35 Writings of George Washington 229 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940).  President John Adams wrote to the Massachusetts Militia, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. \xe2\x80\xa6  Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.  It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter (Oct. 11, 1798), reprinted in 9 Works of John Adams 229 (C. Adams ed. 1971).  Thomas Jefferson concluded his second inaugural address by inviting his audience to pray:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and power and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me that He will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, at 18, 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\nJames Madison, in his first inaugural address, likewise placed his confidence \xe2\x80\x9cin the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25, 28.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor have the views of our people on this matter significantly changed.  Presidents continue to conclude the Presidential oath with the words \xe2\x80\x9cso help me God.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our legislatures, state and national, continue to open their sessions with prayer led by official chaplains.  The sessions of this Court continue to open with the prayer \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the United States and this Honorable Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Invocation of the Almighty by our public figures, at all levels of government, remains commonplace.  Our coinage bears the motto \xe2\x80\x9cIN GOD WE TRUST.\xe2\x80\x9d  And our Pledge of Allegiance contains the acknowledgment that we are a Nation \xe2\x80\x9cunder God.\xe2\x80\x9d  As one of our Supreme Court opinions rightly observed, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zorach</em> v. <em>Clauson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/index.html">343 U.

Who says so?  Surely not the words of the Constitution.  Surely not the history and traditions that reflect our society\xe2\x80\x99s constant understanding of those words.  Surely not even the current sense of our society, recently reflected in an Act of Congress adopted <em>unanimously</em> by the Senate and with only 5 nays in the House of Representatives, see 148 Cong. Rec. S6226 (2002); <em>id.</em>, at H7186, criticizing a Court of Appeals opinion that had held \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional.  See Act of Nov. 13, 2002, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(9), 2(a), 3(a), 116 Stat. 2057, 2058, 2060\xe2\x80\x932061 (reaffirming the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto (\xe2\x80\x9cIn God We Trust\xe2\x80\x9d) and stating that the Pledge of Allegiance is \xe2\x80\x9cclearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing stands behind the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that governmental affirmation of the society\xe2\x80\x99s belief in God is unconstitutional except the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own say-so, citing as support only the unsubstantiated say-so of earlier Courts going back no farther than the mid-20th century.

It is discredited, to begin with, because a majority of the Justices on the current Court (including at least one Member of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority) have, in separate opinions, repudiated the brain-spun \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Lemon </em>test\xe2\x80\x9d that embodies the supposed principle of neutrality between religion and irreligion.

And it is discredited because the Court has not had the courage (or the foolhardiness) to apply the neutrality principle consistently.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship of a shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely indispensable requirement that judicial opinions be grounded in consistently applied principle.  That is what prevents judges from ruling now this way, now that\xe2\x80\x94thumbs up or thumbs down\xe2\x80\x94as their personal preferences dictate.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion forthrightly (or actually, somewhat less than forthrightly) admits that it does not rest upon consistently applied principle.  In a revealing footnote, <em>ante, </em>at 11, n.\xc2\xa010, the Court acknowledges that the \xe2\x80\x9cEstablishment Clause doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d it purports to be applying \xe2\x80\x9clacks the comfort of categorical absolutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  What the Court means by this lovely euphemism is that sometimes the Court chooses to decide cases on the principle that government cannot favor religion, and sometimes it does not.  The footnote goes on to say that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n special instances we have found good reason\xe2\x80\x9d to dispense with the principle, but \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o such reasons present themselves here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It does not identify all of those \xe2\x80\x9cspecial instances,\xe2\x80\x9d much less identify the \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d for their existence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have cataloged elsewhere the variety of circumstances in which this Court\xe2\x80\x94even <em>after</em> its embrace of <em>Lemon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s stated prohibition of such behavior\xe2\x80\x94has approved government action \xe2\x80\x9cundertaken with the specific intention of improving the position of religion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Aguillard, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/578/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/578/index.html">482 U. S. 578</a>, 616 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  See <em>id.</em>, 616\xe2\x80\x93618.  Suffice it to say here that when the government relieves churches from the obligation to pay property taxes, when it allows students to absent themselves from public school to take religious classes, and when it exempts religious organizations from generally applicable prohibitions of religious discrimination, it surely means to bestow a benefit on religious practice\xe2\x80\x94but we have approved it. <em> </em>See <em>Amos,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 338<em> </em>(exemption from federal prohibition of religious discrimination by employers); <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U. S. 664</a>, 673 (1970) (property tax exemption for church property); <em>Zorach,</em> 343 U. S., at 308, 315 (law permitting students to leave public school for the purpose of receiving religious education).  Indeed, we have even approved (post-<em>Lemon</em>) government-led prayer to God.  In <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court upheld the Nebraska State Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s practice of paying a chaplain to lead it in prayer at the opening of legislative sessions.  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o invoke Divine guidance on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not . . . an \xe2\x80\x98establishment\xe2\x80\x99 of religion or a step toward establishment; it is simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 792.  (Why, one wonders, is not respect for the Ten Commandments a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country?)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d for ignoring the neutrality principle set forth in any of these cases was the antiquity of the practice at issue.  See <em>Marsh</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 786\xe2\x80\x93792, 794; <em>Walz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 676\xe2\x80\x93680.  That would be a good reason for finding the neutrality principle a mistaken interpretation of the Constitution, but it is hardly a good reason for letting an unconstitutional practice continue.  We did not hide behind that reason in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/index.html">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964), which found unconstitutional bicameral state legislatures of a sort that had existed since the beginning of the Republic.  And almost monthly, it seems, the Court has not shrunk from invalidating aspects of criminal procedure and penology of similar vintage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Deck </em>v. <em>Missouri</em>, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311) (invalidating practice of shackling defendants absent \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x9311) (Thomas, J., dissenting); <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 14) (invalidating practice of executing under-18-year-old offenders); <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 2, n.\xc2\xa01) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  What, then, could be the genuine \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d for occasionally ignoring the neutrality principle?  I suggest it is the instinct for self-preservation, and the recognition that the Court, which \xe2\x80\x9chas no influence over either the sword or the purse,\xe2\x80\x9d The Federalist No. 78, p. 412 (J. Pole ed. 2005), cannot go too far down the road of an enforced neutrality that contradicts both historical fact and current practice without losing all that sustains it: the willingness of the people to accept its interpretation of the Constitution as definitive, in preference to the contrary interpretation of the democratically elected branches.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Besides appealing to the demonstrably false principle that the government cannot favor religion over irreligion, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion suggests that the posting of the Ten Commandments violates the principle that the government cannot favor one religion over another.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19; see also <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  That is indeed a valid principle where public aid or assistance to religion is concerned, see <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U. S. 639</a>, 652 (2002), or where the free exercise of religion is at issue, <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hialeah,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/520/index.html">508 U. S. 520</a>, 532\xe2\x80\x93533 (1993); <em>id.</em>, at 557\xe2\x80\x93558 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but it necessarily applies in a more limited sense to public acknowledgment of the Creator.  If religion in the public forum had to be entirely nondenominational, there could be no religion in the public forum at all.  One cannot say the word \xe2\x80\x9cGod,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe Almighty,\xe2\x80\x9d one cannot offer public supplication or thanksgiving, without contradicting the beliefs of some people that there are many gods, or that God or the gods pay no attention to human affairs.  With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists.  The Thanksgiving Proclamation issued by George Washington at the instance of the First Congress was scrupulously nondenominational\xe2\x80\x94but it was monotheistic.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In <em>Marsh </em>v.<em> Chambers, supra, </em>we said that the fact the particular prayers offered in the Nebraska Legislature were \xe2\x80\x9cin the Judeo-Christian tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 793, posed no additional problem, because \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 794\xe2\x80\x93795.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historical practices thus demonstrate that there is a distance between the acknowledgment of a single Creator and the establishment of a religion.  The former is, as <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>put it, \xe2\x80\x9ca tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 792.  The three most popular religions in the United States, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam\xe2\x80\x94which combined account for 97.7% of all believers\xe2\x80\x94are monotheistic.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004\xe2\x80\x932005, p. 55 (124th ed. 2004) (Table No. 67).  All of them, moreover (Islam included), believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life.  See 13 Encyclopedia of Religion 9074 (2d ed. 2005); The Qur\xe2\x80\x99an 104 (M. Haleem trans. 2004).  Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable, insofar as discriminating against other religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God.  Both practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the population\xe2\x80\x94from Christians to Muslims\xe2\x80\x94that they cannot be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few remarks are necessary in response to the criticism of this dissent by the Court, as well as Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 criticism in the related case of <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, <em>ante</em>, p. 1.<em>  Justice Stevens</em>\xe2\x80\x99 writing is largely devoted to an attack upon a straw man.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eliance on early religious proclamations and statements made by the Founders is \xe2\x80\xa6 problematic,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause those views were not espoused at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 nor enshrined in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Orden</em>,<em> ante</em>,<em> </em>at 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).  But I have not relied upon (as he and the Court in this case do) mere \xe2\x80\x9cproclamations and statements\xe2\x80\x9d of the Founders.  I have relied primarily upon official acts and official proclamations of the United States or of the component branches of its Government, including the First Congress\xe2\x80\x99s beginning of the tradition of legislative prayer to God, its appointment of congressional chaplains, its legislative proposal of a Thanksgiving Proclamation, and its reenactment of the Northwest Territory Ordinance; our first President\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a Thanksgiving Proclamation; and invocation of God at the opening of sessions of the Supreme Court.  The only mere \xe2\x80\x9cproclamations and statements\xe2\x80\x9d of the Founders I have relied upon were statements of Founders who occupied federal office, and spoke in at least a quasi-official capacity\xe2\x80\x94Washington\xe2\x80\x99s prayer at the opening of his Presidency and his Farewell Address, President John Adams\xe2\x80\x99 letter to the Massachusetts Militia, and Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s and Madison\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural addresses.  The Court and Justice Stevens, by contrast, appeal to no official or even quasi-official action in support of their view of the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x94only James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, written before the federal Constitution had even been proposed, two letters written by Madison long after he was President, and the quasi-official <em>inaction </em>of Thomas Jefferson in refusing to issue a Thanksgiving Proclamation.  See <em>ante</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331; <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 19 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The Madison Memorial and Remonstrance, dealing as it does with enforced contribution to religion rather than public acknowledgment of God, is irrelevant; one of the letters is utterly ambiguous as to the point at issue here, and should not be read to contradict Madison\xe2\x80\x99s statements in his first inaugural address, quoted earlier; even the other letter does not disapprove public acknowledgment of God, unless one posits (what Madison\xe2\x80\x99s own actions as President would contradict) that reference to God contradicts \xe2\x80\x9cthe equality of <em>all</em> religious sects.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Letter from James Madison to Edward Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution 105\xe2\x80\x93106 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987).  And as to Jefferson: the notoriously self-contradicting Jefferson did not choose to have his nonauthorship of a Thanksgiving Proclamation inscribed on his tombstone.  What he did have inscribed was his authorship of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a governmental act which begins \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas Almighty God hath created the mind free . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa757\xe2\x80\x931 (Lexis 2003). </p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer for Justice Stevens to say that the understanding that these official and quasi-official actions reflect was not \xe2\x80\x9censhrined in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 18 (dissenting opinion).  The Establishment Clause, upon which Justice Stevens would rely, <em>was </em>enshrined in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text, and these official actions show <em>what it meant.  </em>There were doubtless some who thought it should have a broader meaning, but those views were plainly rejected.  Justice Stevens says that reliance on these actions is \xe2\x80\x9cbound to paint a misleading picture,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 19, but it is hard to see why.  What is more probative of the meaning of the Establishment Clause than the actions of the very Congress that proposed it, and of the first President charged with observing it?</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also appeals to the undoubted fact that some in the founding generation thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should have a <em>narrower </em>meaning, protecting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protestantism.  See <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  I am at a loss to see how this helps his case, except by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke.  (Since most thought the Clause permitted government invocation of monotheism, and some others thought it permitted government invocation of Christianity, he proposes that it be construed not to permit any government invocation of religion at all.)  At any rate, those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more expansive ones.  Washington\xe2\x80\x99s First Thanksgiving Proclamation is merely an example.  <em>All </em>of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied, virtually all<em> </em>Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our history,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and <em>all </em>the other examples of our Government\xe2\x80\x99s favoring religion that I have cited, have invoked God, but not Jesus Christ.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Rather than relying upon Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 assurance that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he original understanding of the type of \xe2\x80\x98religion\xe2\x80\x99 that qualified for constitutional protection under the First amendment certainly did not include . . . followers of Judaism and Islam,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 22; see also <em>ante</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333, I would prefer to take the word of George Washington, who, in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, wrote that,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.  It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 The Papers of George Washington, Presidential Series 285 (D.

See <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9326 (dissenting opinion).  This is more smoke.  Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term, when he joined an opinion insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, but nonetheless applying it against the State of Washington.  See <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004).  The notion that incorporation empties the incorporated provisions of their original meaning has no support in either reason or precedent.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens argues that original meaning should not be the touchstone anyway, but that we should rather \xe2\x80\x9cexpoun[d] the meaning of constitutional provisions with one eye towards our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and the other fixed on its democratic aspirations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (dissenting opinion).<em> </em>This is not the place to debate the merits of the \xe2\x80\x9cliving Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d though I must observe that Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 quotation from <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819), refutes rather than supports that approach.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming, however, that the meaning of the Constitution ought to change according to \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic aspirations,\xe2\x80\x9d why are those aspirations to be found in Justices\xe2\x80\x99 notions of what the Establishment Clause ought to mean, rather than in the democratically adopted dispositions of our current society?  As I have observed above, numerous provisions of our laws and numerous continuing practices of our people demonstrate that the government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of God (and hence the government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the Ten Commandments) is unobjectionable\xe2\x80\x94including a statute enacted by Congress almost unanimously less than three years ago, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional, see 116 Stat., at 2058.  To ignore all this is not to give effect to \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic aspirations\xe2\x80\x9d but to frustrate them.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I must respond to Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that I would \xe2\x80\x9cmarginaliz[e] the belief systems of more than 7 million Americans\xe2\x80\x9d who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic.  <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, n.\xc2\xa018 (dissenting opinion).  Surely that is a gross exaggeration.  The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free Exercise Clause, and by those aspects of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to government acknowledgment of the Creator.  Invocation of God despite their beliefs is permitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recognized by the religion clauses of the First Amendment, but because governmental invocation of God is not an establishment.  Justice Stevens fails to recognize that in the context of public acknowledgments of God there are legitimate <em>competing</em> interests: On the one hand, the interest of that minority in not feeling \xe2\x80\x9cexcluded\xe2\x80\x9d; but on the other, the interest of the overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and supplication <em>as a people, </em>and with respect to our national endeavors.  Our national tradition has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It is not for this Court to change a disposition that accounts, many Americans think, for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quotation attributed to various authors, including Bismarck, but which I prefer to associate with Charles de Gaulle: \xe2\x80\x9cGod watches over little children, drunkards, and the United States of America.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As bad as the <em>Lemon </em>test is, it is worse for the fact that, since its inception, its seemingly simple mandates have been manipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is no different.  In two respects it modifies <em>Lemon </em>to ratchet up the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hostility to religion.  First, the Court justifies inquiry into legislative purpose, not as an end itself, but as a means to ascertain the appearance of the government action to an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective observer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Because in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view the true danger to be guarded against is that the objective observer would feel like an \xe2\x80\x9coutside[r]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnot [a] full membe[r] of the political community,\xe2\x80\x9d its inquiry focuses not on the <em>actual purpose</em> of government action, but the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose apparent from government action.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 12<em>.</em> Under this approach, even if a government could show that its actual purpose was not to advance religion, it would presumably violate the Constitution as long as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s objective observer would think otherwise.  See <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. </em>v. <em>Pinette</em>, 515 U.S. 753, 776\xe2\x80\x93777 (1995) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the reasonable observer would view a government practice as endorsing religion, . . . it is our <em>duty</em> to hold the practice invalid,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the law at issue was neutral and the benefit conferred on the religious entity was incidental).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence that bases the unconstitutionality of a government practice that does not <em>actually</em> advance religion on the hopes of the government that it <em>would</em> do so.  See <em>Edwards</em>, 482 U. S., at 639.  But that oddity pales in comparison to the one invited by today\xe2\x80\x99s analysis: the legitimacy of a government action with a wholly secular effect would turn on the <em>misperception</em> of an imaginary observer that the government officials behind the action had the intent to advance religion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court replaces <em>Lemon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the government have \xe2\x80\x9c<em>a</em> secular . . . purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d 403 U. S., at 612 (emphasis added), with the heightened requirement that the secular purpose \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate\xe2\x80\x9d over any purpose to advance religion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  The Court treats this extension as a natural outgrowth of the longstanding requirement that the government\xe2\x80\x99s secular purpose not be a sham, but simple logic shows the two to be unrelated.  If the government\xe2\x80\x99s proffered secular purpose is not genuine, then the government has no secular purpose at all.  The new demand that secular purpose predominate contradicts <em>Lemon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s more limited requirement, and finds no support in our cases.  In all but one of the five cases in which this Court has invalidated a government practice on the basis of its purpose to benefit religion, it has first declared that the statute was motivated entirely by the desire to advance religion.  See <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/290/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/290/index.html">530 U.

S. 97</a>, 107\xe2\x80\x93109 (1968).  In <em>Edwards</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court did say that the state action was invalid because its \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpreeminent\xe2\x80\x9d purpose was to advance a particular religious belief, 482 U. S., at 590, 593, 594, but that statement was unnecessary to the result, since the Court rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s only proffered secular purpose as a sham.

But today\xe2\x80\x99s extension makes things even worse.  By shifting the focus of <em>Lemon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s purpose prong from the search for a genuine, secular motivation to the hunt for a predominantly religious purpose, the Court converts what has in the past been a fairly limited inquiry into a rigorous review of the full record.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Those responsible for the adoption of the Religion Clauses would surely regard it as a bitter irony that the religious values they designed those Clauses to <em>protect</em> have now become so distasteful to this Court that if they constitute anything more than a subordinate motive for government action they will invalidate it.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even accepting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Lemon</em>-based premises, the displays at issue here were constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To any person who happened to walk down the hallway of the McCreary or Pulaski County Courthouse during the roughly nine months when the Foundations Displays were exhibited, the displays must have seemed unremarkable\xe2\x80\x94if indeed they were noticed at all.  The walls of both courthouses were already lined with historical documents and other assorted portraits; each Foundations Display was exhibited in the same format as these other displays and nothing in the record suggests that either County took steps to give it greater prominence.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Foundations of American Law and Government Display,\xe2\x80\x9d each display consisted of nine equally sized documents: the original version of the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Star Spangled Banner, the Mayflower Compact of 1620, a picture of Lady Justice, the National Motto of the United States (\xe2\x80\x9cIn God We Trust\xe2\x80\x9d), the Preamble to the Kentucky Constitution, and the Ten Commandments.  The displays did not emphasize any of the nine documents in any way: The frame holding the Ten Commandments was of the same size and had the same appearance as that which held each of the other documents.  See 354 F.\xc2\xa03d 438, 443 (CA6 2003). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Posted with the documents was a plaque, identifying the display, and explaining that it \xe2\x80\x9ccontains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The explanation related to the Ten Commandments was third in the list of nine and did not serve to distinguish it from the other documents.  It stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and the formation of our country.  That influence is clearly seen in the Declaration of Independence, which declared that, \xe2\x80\x98We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\xe2\x80\x99  The Ten Commandments provide the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face, the Foundations Displays manifested the purely secular purpose that the Counties asserted before the District Court: \xe2\x80\x9cto display documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Affidavit of Judge Jimmie Green in Support of Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Opposition to Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Motion for Contempt or, in the Alternative, for Supplemental Preliminary Injunction in Civ. A. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93507 (ED Ky.), p. 2.  That the Displays included the Ten Commandments did not transform their apparent secular purpose into one of impermissible advocacy for Judeo-Christian beliefs.  Even an isolated display of the Decalogue conveys, at worst, \xe2\x80\x9can equivocal message, perhaps of respect for Judaism, for religion in general, or for law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 652 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  But when the Ten Commandments appear alongside other documents of secular significance in a display devoted to the foundations of American law and government, the context communicates that the Ten Commandments are included, not to teach their binding nature as a religious text, but to show their unique contribution to the development of the legal system.  See <em>id</em>., at 652\xe2\x80\x93653.  This is doubly true when the display is introduced by a document that informs passersby that it \xe2\x80\x9ccontains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same result follows if the Ten Commandments display is viewed in light of the government practices that this Court has countenanced in the past.  The acknowledgment of the contribution that religion in general, and the Ten Commandments in particular, have made to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s legal and governmental heritage is surely no more of a step towards establishment of religion than was the practice of legislative prayer we approved in<em> Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html">463 U.

The parallels between this case and <em>Marsh </em>and <em>Lynch</em> are sufficiently compelling that they ought to decide this case, even under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s misguided Establishment Clause jurisprudence.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acknowledgment of the contribution that religion has made to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s legal and governmental heritage partakes of a centuries-old tradition.

Federal, State, and local governments across the Nation have engaged in such display.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The Supreme Court Building itself includes depictions of Moses with the Ten Commandments in the Courtroom and on the east pediment of the building, and symbols of the Ten Commandments \xe2\x80\x9cadorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 9 (plurality opinion).  Similar depictions of the Decalogue appear on public buildings and monuments throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The frequency of these displays testifies to the popular understanding that the Ten Commandments are a foundation of the rule of law, and a symbol of the role that religion played, and continues to play, in our system of government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps in recognition of the centrality of the Ten Commandments as a widely recognized symbol of religion in public life, the Court is at pains to dispel the impression that its decision will require governments across the country to sandblast the Ten Commandments from the public square.  See <em>ante</em>, at 26.  The constitutional problem, the Court says, is with the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 <em>purpose</em> in erecting the Foundations Displays, not the displays themselves.  The Court adds in a footnote: \xe2\x80\x9cOne consequence of taking account of the purpose underlying past actions is that the same government action may be constitutional if taken in the first instance and unconstitutional if it has a sectarian heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa014.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This inconsistency may be explicable in theory, but I suspect that the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective observer\xe2\x80\x9d with whom the Court is so concerned will recognize its absurdity in practice.   By virtue of details familiar only to the parties to litigation and their lawyers, McCreary and Pulaski Counties, Kentucky, and Rutherford County, Tennessee, have been ordered to remove the same display that appears in courthouses from Mercer County, Kentucky to Elkhart County, Indiana.  Compare <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Tenn. </em>v. <em>Rutherford County</em>, 209 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 799, 808\xe2\x80\x93809 (MD Tenn. 2002) (holding Foundations Display to be unconstitutional based on prior actions of county commission) with <em>Books </em>v. <em>Elkhart County</em>, 401 F.\xc2\xa03d 857, 869 (CA7 2005) (sustaining Foundations Display as \xe2\x80\x9csecular . . . in its purpose and effect\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.</em> v. <em>Mercer County</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 777, 787\xe2\x80\x93789 (ED Ky. 2002) (rejecting Establishment Clause challenge to an identical Foundations Display and distinguishing <em>McCreary County</em> on the ground that the County\xe2\x80\x99s purpose had not been \xe2\x80\x9ctainted with any prior history\xe2\x80\x9d).  Displays erected in silence (and under the direction of good legal advice) are permissible, while those hung after discussion and debate are deemed unconstitutional.  Reduction of the Establishment Clause to such minutiae trivializes the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection against religious establishment; indeed, it may inflame religious passions by making the passing comments of every government official the subject of endless litigation.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Counties exhibited the Foundations Displays with the purpose of promoting religion is doubtful.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the impermissible motive was apparent from the initial displays of the Ten Commandments all by themselves: When that occurs, the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9ca religious object is unmistakable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  Surely that cannot be.  If, as discussed above, the Commandments have a proper place in our civic history, even placing them by themselves can be civically motivated\xe2\x80\x94especially when they are placed, not in a school (as they were in the <em>Stone </em>case upon which the Court places such reliance), but in a courthouse.  Cf. <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 4 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances surrounding the display\xe2\x80\x99s placement on the capital grounds, and its physical setting suggest that the State itself intended the \xe2\x80\xa6 nonreligious aspects of the tablets\xe2\x80\x99 message to predominate\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the fact that at the posting of the exhibit a clergyman was present is unremarkable (clergymen taking particular pride in the role of the Ten Commandments in our civic history); and even more unremarkable the fact that the clergyman \xe2\x80\x9ctestified to the certainty of the existence of God,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has in the past prohibited government actions that \xe2\x80\x9cproselytize or advance any one, or . . . disparage any other, faith or belief,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Marsh</em>, 463 U. S., at 794\xe2\x80\x93795, or that apply some level of coercion (though I and others have disagreed about the form that coercion must take),<em> </em>see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Weisman</em>, 505 U. S., at 592 (prayer at high-school graduation invalid because of \xe2\x80\x9csubtle coercive pressure\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 642 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The passive display of the Ten Commandments, even standing alone, does not begin to do either.  What Justice Kennedy said of the cr\xc4\x8dche in <em>Allegheny County</em> is equally true of the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 original Ten Commandments\ndisplays:  </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo one was compelled to observe or participate in any religious ceremony or activity.  [T]he count[ies] [did not] contribut[e] significant amounts of tax money to serve the cause of one religious faith.  [The Ten Commandments] are purely passive symbols of [the religious foundation for many of our laws and governmental institutions].  Passersby who disagree with the message conveyed by th[e] displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their backs, just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of government speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 U. S., at 664 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  </p>\n<p align="left">\nNor is it the case that a solo display of the Ten Commandments advances any one faith.  They are assuredly a religious symbol, but they are not so closely associated with a single religious belief that their display can reasonably be understood as preferring one religious sect over another.  The Ten Commandments are recognized by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam alike as divinely given.  See 13 Encyclopedia of Religion 9074 (2d ed. 2005).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also points to the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 second displays, which featured a number of statements in historical documents reflecting a religious influence, and the resolutions that accompanied their erection, as evidence of an impermissible religious purpose.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [second] display\xe2\x80\x99s unstinting focus . . . on religious passages, show[s] that the Counties were posting the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  No, all it necessarily shows is that the exhibit was meant to focus upon the historic role of religious belief in our national life\xe2\x80\x94which is entirely permissible.  And the same can be said of the resolution.  To forbid any government focus upon this aspect of our history is to display what Justice Goldberg called \xe2\x80\x9cuntutored devotion to the concept of neutrality,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Abington Township,</em> 374 U. S., at 306 (concurring opinion), that would commit the Court (and the Nation) to a revisionist agenda of secularization.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning at last to the displays actually at issue in this case, the Court faults the Counties for not <em>repealing</em> the resolution expressing what the Court believes to be an impermissible intent.  Under these circumstances, the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9cno reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Counties had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  Even were I to accept all that the Court has said before, I would not agree with that assessment.  To begin with, of course, it is unlikely that a reasonable observer <em>would even have been aware </em>of the resolutions, so there would be nothing to \xe2\x80\x9ccast off.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court implies that the Counties may have been able to remedy the \xe2\x80\x9ctaint\xe2\x80\x9d from the old resolutions by enacting a new one.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  But that action would have been wholly unnecessary in light of the explanation that the Counties included<em> with the displays themselves</em>: A plaque next to the documents informed all who passed by that each display \xe2\x80\x9ccontains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Additionally, there was no reason for the Counties to repeal or repudiate the resolutions adopted with the hanging of the second displays, since they related <em>only to the second displays</em>.<font super="1">  After complying with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order to remove the second displays \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d and erecting new displays that in content and by express assertion reflected a <em>different </em>purpose from that identified in the resolutions, the Counties had no reason to believe that their previous resolutions would be deemed to be the basis for their actions.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  After the Counties discovered that the sentiments expressed in the resolutions could be attributed to their most recent displays (in oral argument before this Court), they repudiated them immediately. </font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum: The first displays did not necessarily evidence an intent to further religious practice; nor did the second displays, or the resolutions authorizing them; and there is in any event no basis for attributing whatever intent motivated the first and second displays to the third.  Given the presumption of regularity that always accompanies our review of official action, see <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319 n.\xc2\xa09, the Court has identified no evidence of a purpose to advance religion in a way that is inconsistent with our cases.  The Court may well be correct in identifying the third displays as the fruit of a desire to display the Ten Commandments, <em>ante</em>, at 24, but neither our cases nor our history support its assertion that such a desire renders the fruit poisonous.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, President\xe2\x80\x99s Thanksgiving Day 2004 Proclamation (Nov. 23, 2004), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/11/\n20041123-4.html (all internet materials as visited June 24, 2005 and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The fountainhead of this jurisprudence, <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing</em>, based its dictum that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]either a state nor the Federal Government . . . can pass laws which . . . aid all religions,\xe2\x80\x9d 330 U.

It seems to me patently untrue\xe2\x80\x94given the Decalogue\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundeniable historical meaning\xe2\x80\x9d as a symbol of the religious foundations of law, see <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11 (plurality opinion)\xe2\x80\x94when they are posted in a courthouse display of historical documents.  The observer would no more think himself \xe2\x80\x9ccalled upon to act\xe2\x80\x9d in conformance with the Commandments than he would think himself called upon to think and act like William Bradford because of the courthouse posting of the Mayflower Compact\xe2\x80\x94especially when he is <em>told</em> that the exhibit consists of documents that contributed to American law and government.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The significant number of cases involving Ten Commandments displays in the last two years suggests the breadth of their appearance.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Books </em>v. <em>Elkhart County</em>, 401 F.\xc2\xa03d 857, 858\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA7 2005) (Ten Commandments included in a display identical to the Foundations display); <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Fraternal Order of Eagles</em>, 395 F.\xc2\xa03d 693, 696 (CA7 2005) (Ten Commandments monument in city park since 1965);<em> Modrovich </em>v. <em>Allegheny County</em>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d 397, 399 (CA3 2004) (Ten Commandments plaque, donated in 1918, on wall of Allegheny County Courthouse); <em>Freethought Soc. of Greater Philadelphia</em> v. <em>Chester County</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 247, 249 (CA3 2003) (Ten Commandment plaque, donated in 1920, on wall of Chester County Courthouse);<em> King </em>v. <em>Richmond County</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa03d 1271, 1273\xe2\x80\x931274 (CA11 2003) (Ten Commandments depicted in county seal since 1872).</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because there are interpretational differences between faiths and within faiths concerning the meaning and perhaps even the text of the Commandments, Justice Stevens maintains that <em>any</em> display of the text of the Ten Commandments is impermissible because it \xe2\x80\x9cinvariably places the [government] at the center of a serious sectarian dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Orden</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13 (dissenting opinion).  I think not.  The sectarian dispute regarding text, if serious, is not widely known.  I doubt that most religious adherents are even aware that there are competing versions with doctrinal consequences (I certainly was not).  In any event, the context of the display here could not conceivably cause the viewer to believe that the government was taking sides in a doctrinal controversy.   </p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Posted less than a month after respondents filed suit, the second displays included an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence, the Preamble to the Kentucky Constitution, a page from the Congressional Record declaring 1983 to be the Year of the Bible and the proclamation of President Reagan stating the same, a proclamation of President Lincoln designating April 30, 1863 as a National Day of Prayer and Humiliation, an excerpt from Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cReply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon Presentation of a Bible\xe2\x80\x9d stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Mayflower Compact.  96 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 679, 684 (ED Ky., 2000). The Counties erected the displays in accordance with a resolution passed by their legislative bodies, authorizing the County-Judge Executives \xe2\x80\x9cto read or post the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky are founded,\xe2\x80\x9d and to display alongside the Ten Commandments copies of the documents listed above \xe2\x80\x9cwithout censorship because of any Christian or religious references in these writings, documents, and historical records.\xe2\x80\x9d  Def. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in Support of Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss in Civ. A. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93507, p.\xc2\xa01 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def. Exh. 1).</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa020, it is clear that the resolutions were closely tied to the second displays, but not to the third.  Each of the documents included in the second displays was authorized by the resolutions, and those displays, consistent with the resolutions\xe2\x80\x99 direction to \xe2\x80\x9cpost the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky are founded,\xe2\x80\x9d Def. Exh. 1, consisted of a large copy of the Ten Commandments alongside much smaller framed copies of other historical, religious documents.  The third displays, in contrast, included documents not mentioned in the resolutions (the Magna Carta and a picture of Lady Justice) and did not include documents authorized by the resolutions (correspondence and proclamations of Abraham Lincoln and the Resolution of Congress declaring 1983 to be the Year of the Bible).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The resolutions also provided that they were to be posted beside the displays that they authorized.  Def. Exh. 1, at\xc2\xa09.  Yet respondents have never suggested the resolutions were posted next to the third displays, and the record before the Court indicates that they were not.  The photos included in the Appendix show that the third displays included 10 frames\xe2\x80\x94the nine historical documents and the prefatory statement explaining the relevance of each of the documents.
