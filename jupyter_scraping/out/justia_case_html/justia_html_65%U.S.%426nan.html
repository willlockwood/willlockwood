CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case has been brought here by a writ of error directed to the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.  But upon looking into the transcript, it appears that the judgment which it is proposed to revise is a judgment reversing the decision of the court below and awarding a new trial.  There is, therefore, no final judgment in the case, and the writ must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
