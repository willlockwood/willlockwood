Sellers are required to collect and remit the tax to the State, but if they do not then in-state consumers are responsible for paying a use tax at the same rate.  Under<i> National Bellas Hess, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Revenue of Ill.</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753, and <i>Quill Corp.</i> v. <i>North Dakota</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298, South Dakota may not require a business that has no physical presence in the State to collect its sales tax.  Consumer compliance rates are notoriously low, however, and it is estimated that <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill </i>cause South Dakota to lose between $48 and $58 million annually.  Concerned about the erosion of its sales tax base and corresponding loss of critical funding for state and local services, the South Dakota Legislature enacted a law requiring out-of-state sellers to collect and remit sales tax \xe2\x80\x9cas if the seller had a physical presence in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act covers only sellers that, on an annual basis, deliver more than $100,000 of goods or services into the State or engage in 200 or more separate transactions for the delivery of goods or services into the State.  Respondents, top online retailers with no employees or real estate in South Dakota, each meet the Act\xe2\x80\x99s minimum sales or transactions requirement, but do not collect the State\xe2\x80\x99s sales tax.  South Dakota filed suit in state court, seeking a declaration that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are valid and applicable to respondents and an injunction requiring respondents to register for licenses to collect and remit the sales tax.  Respondents sought summary judgment, arguing that the Act is unconstitutional.  The trial court granted their motion.  The State Supreme Court affirmed on the ground that <i>Quill</i> is controlling precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because the physical presence rule of <i>Quill</i> is unsound and incorrect, <i>Quill Corp.</i> v. <i>North Dakota</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298, and <i>National Bellas Hess, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Revenue of Ill.</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753,<i> </i>are overruled.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0An understanding of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause principles and their application to state taxes is instructive here.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Two primary principles mark the boundaries of a State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate interstate commerce: State regulations may not discriminate against interstate commerce; and States may not impose undue burdens on interstate commerce.  These principles guide the courts in adjudicating challenges to state laws under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0They also animate Commerce Clause precedents addressing the validity of state taxes, which will be sustained so long as they (1) apply to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, (2) are fairly apportioned, (3) do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4) are fairly related to the services the State provides.  See <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 274, 279.  Before <i>Complete Auto</i>, the Court held in <i>Bellas Hess</i> that a \xe2\x80\x9cseller whose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. mail\xe2\x80\x9d lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State required by the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause, and that unless the retailer maintained a physical presence in the State, the State lacked the power to require that retailer to collect a local tax.  386 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 758.  In <i>Quill</i>, the Court<i> </i>overruled the due process holding, but not the Commerce Clause holding, grounding the physical presence rule in <i>Complete Auto</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a tax have a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d with the activity being taxed.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The physical presence rule<i> </i>has long been criticized as giving out-of-state sellers an advantage.  Each year, it becomes further removed from economic reality and results in significant revenue losses to the States.  These critiques underscore that the rule, both as first formulated and as applied today, is an incorrect interpretation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0<i>Quill </i>is flawed on its own terms.  First, the physical presence rule is not a necessary interpretation of <i>Complete Auto\xe2\x80\x99</i>s nexus requirement.  That requirement is \xe2\x80\x9cclosely related,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bellas Hess</i>, 386 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 756, to the due process requirement that there be \xe2\x80\x9csome definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Miller Brothers Co.</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 340, 344\xe2\x80\x93345.  And, as <i>Quill</i> itself recognized, a business need not have a physical presence in a State to satisfy the demands of due process.  When considering whether a State may levy a tax, Due Process and Commerce Clause standards, though not identical or coterminous, have significant parallels.  The reasons given in <i>Quill </i>for rejecting the physical presence rule for due process purposes apply as well to the question whether physical presence is a requisite for an out-of-state seller\xe2\x80\x99s liability to remit sales taxes.  Other aspects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine can better and more accurately address potential burdens on interstate commerce, whether or not <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence rule is satisfied.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Second, <i>Quill </i>creates rather than resolves market distortions.  In effect, it is a judicially created tax shelter for businesses that limit their physical presence in a State but sell their goods and services to the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumers, something that has become easier and more prevalent as technology has advanced.  The rule also produces an incentive to avoid physical presence in multiple States, affecting development that might be efficient or desirable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Third, <i>Quill</i> imposes the sort of arbitrary, formalistic distinction that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s modern Commerce Clause precedents disavow in favor of \xe2\x80\x9ca sensitive, case-by-case analysis of purposes and effects,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>West Lynn Creamery, Inc.</i> v. <i>Healy</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 201.  It treats economically identical actors differently for arbitrary reasons.  For example, a business that maintains a few items of inventory in a small warehouse in a State is required to collect and remit a tax on all of its sales in the State, while a seller with a pervasive Internet presence cannot be subject to the same tax for the sales of the same items.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0When the day-to-day functions of marketing and distribution in the modern economy are considered, it becomes evident that <i>Quill\xe2\x80\x99</i>s physical presence rule is artificial, not just \xe2\x80\x9cat its edges,\xe2\x80\x9d 504 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 315, but in its entirety.  Modern e-commerce does not align analytically with a test that relies on the sort of physical presence defined in <i>Quill</i>.  And the Court should not maintain a rule that ignores substantial virtual connections to the State.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0The physical presence rule of <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill</i> is also an extraordinary imposition by the Judiciary on States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to collect taxes and perform critical public functions.  Forty-one States, two Territories, and the District of Columbia have asked the Court to reject <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x99s test.  Helping respondents\xe2\x80\x99 customers evade a lawful tax unfairly shifts an increased share of the taxes to those consumers who buy from competitors with a physical presence in the State.  It is essential to public confidence in the tax system that the Court avoid creating inequitable exceptions.  And it is also essential to the confidence placed in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause decisions.  By giving some online retailers an arbitrary advantage over their competitors who collect state sales taxes, <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence rule has limited States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0<i>Stare decisis</i> can no longer support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of a valid exercise of the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power.  If it becomes apparent that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause decisions prohibit the States from exercising their lawful sovereign powers, the Court should be vigilant in correcting the error.  It is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s own creation.  The Internet revolution has made <i>Quill\xe2\x80\x99</i>s<i> </i>original error all the more egregious and harmful.  The <i>Quill </i>Court did not have before it the present realities of the interstate marketplace, where the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s prevalence and power have changed the dynamics of the national economy.  The expansion of e-commerce has also increased the revenue shortfall faced by States seeking to collect their sales and use taxes, leading the South Dakota Legislature to declare an emergency.  The argument, moreover, that the physical presence rule is clear and easy to apply is unsound, as attempts to apply the physical presence rule to online retail sales have proved unworkable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Because the physical presence rule as defined by <i>Quill </i>is no longer a clear or easily applicable standard, arguments for reliance based on its clarity are misplaced.  <i>Stare decisis</i> may accommodate \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate reliance interest[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ross</i>,\n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 798, 824, but a business \xe2\x80\x9cis in no position to found a constitutional right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the practical opportunities for tax avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Nelson</i> v. <i>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359, 366.  Startups and small businesses may benefit from the physical presence rule, but here South Dakota affords small merchants a reasonable degree of protection.  Finally, other aspects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause doctrine can protect against any undue burden on interstate commerce, taking into consideration the small businesses, startups, or others who engage in commerce across state lines.  The potential for such issues to arise in some later case cannot justify retaining an artificial, anachronistic rule that deprives States of vast revenues from major businesses.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0In the absence of <i>Quill </i>and <i>Bellas Hess</i>, the first prong of the <i>Complete Auto </i>test simply asks whether the tax applies to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 279.  Here, the nexus is clearly sufficient.  The Act applies only to sellers who engage in a significant quantity of business in the State, and respondents are large, national companies that undoubtedly maintain an extensive virtual presence.  Any remaining claims regarding the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x99s application in the absence of <i>Quill </i>and <i>Bellas Hess </i>may be addressed in the first instance on remand.

This case requires the Court to determine when an out-of-state seller can be required to collect and remit that tax.  All concede that taxing the sales in question here is lawful.  The question is whether the out-of-state seller can be held responsible for its payment, and this turns on a proper interpretation of the Commerce Clause, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In two earlier cases the Court held that an out-of-state seller\xe2\x80\x99s liability to collect and remit the tax to the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s State depended on whether the seller had a physical presence in that State, but that mere shipment of goods into the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s State, following an order from a catalog, did not satisfy the physical presence requirement.  <i>National Bellas Hess, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Revenue of Ill.</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753 (1967); <i>Quill Corp.</i> v. <i>North Dakota</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298 (1992).  The Court granted certiorari here to reconsider the scope and validity of the physical presence rule mandated by those cases.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Like most States, South Dakota has a sales tax.  It taxes the retail sales of goods and services in the State.  S.\xc2\xa0D. Codified Laws \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x9345\xe2\x80\x932, 10\xe2\x80\x9345\xe2\x80\x934 (2010 and Supp. 2017).  Sellers are generally required to collect and remit this tax to the Department of Revenue.  \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x9345\xe2\x80\x9327.3.  If for some reason the sales tax is not remitted by the seller, then in-state consumers are separately responsible for paying a use tax at the same rate.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x9346\xe2\x80\x932, 10\xe2\x80\x9346\xe2\x80\x934, 10\xe2\x80\x9346\xe2\x80\x936.  Many States employ this kind of complementary sales and use tax regime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill</i>, South Dakota may not require a business to collect its sales tax if the business lacks a physical presence in the State.  Without that physical presence, South Dakota instead must rely on its residents to pay the use tax owed on their purchases from out-of-state sellers.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he impracticability of [this] collection from the multitude of individual purchasers is obvious.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> National Geographic Soc.</i> v. <i>California Bd. of Equalization</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551, 555 (1977).  And consumer compliance rates are notoriously low.  See,<i> e.g.,</i> GAO, Report to Congressional Requesters: Sales Taxes, States Could Gain Revenue from Expanded Authority, but Businesses Are Likely to Experience Compliance Costs 5 (GAO\xe2\x80\x9318\xe2\x80\x93114, Nov. 2017) (Sales Taxes Report); California State Bd. of Equalization, Revenue Estimate: Electronic Commerce and Mail Order Sales 7 (2013) (Table 3) (estimating a 4 percent collection rate).  It is estimated that <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill </i>cause the States to lose between $8 and $33 billion every year.  See Sales Taxes Report, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (estimating $8 to $13 billion); Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (citing estimates of $23 and $33.9 billion).  In South Dakota alone, the Department of Revenue estimates revenue loss at $48 to $58 million annually.  App. 24.  Particularly because South Dakota has no state income tax, it must put substantial reliance on its sales and use taxes for the revenue necessary to fund essential services.  Those taxes account for over 60 percent of its general fund.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2016, South Dakota confronted the serious inequity <i>Quill </i>imposes by enacting S. 106\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to provide for the collection of sales taxes from certain remote sellers, to establish certain Legislative findings, and to declare an emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. 106, 2016 Leg. Assembly, 91st Sess. (S. D. 2016) (S. B. 106).  The legislature found that the inability to collect sales tax from remote sellers was \xe2\x80\x9cseriously eroding the sales tax base\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccausing revenue losses and imminent harm .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. through the loss of critical funding for state and local services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78(1).  The legislature also declared an emergency: \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79.  Fearing further erosion of the tax base, the legislature expressed its intention to \xe2\x80\x9capply South Dakota\xe2\x80\x99s sales and use tax obligations to the limit of federal and state constitutional doctrines\xe2\x80\x9d and noted the urgent need for this Court to reconsider its precedents.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78(11), (8).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To that end, the Act requires out-of-state sellers to collect and remit sales tax \xe2\x80\x9cas if the seller had a physical presence in the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71.  The Act applies only to sellers that, on an annual basis, deliver more than $100,000 of goods or services into the State or engage in 200 or more separate transactions for the delivery of goods or services into the State.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Act also forecloses the retroactive application of this requirement and provides means for the Act to be appropriately stayed until the constitutionality of the law has been clearly established.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75, 3, 8(10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents Wayfair, Inc., Overstock.com, Inc., and Newegg, Inc., are merchants with no employees or real estate in South Dakota.  Wayfair, Inc., is a leading online retailer of home goods and furniture and had net revenues of over $4.7 billion last year.  Overstock.com, Inc., is one of the top online retailers in the United States, selling a wide variety of products from home goods and furniture to clothing and jewelry; and it had net revenues of over $1.7 billion last year.  Newegg, Inc., is a major online retailer of consumer electronics in the United States.  Each of these three companies ships its goods directly to purchasers throughout the United States, including South Dakota.  Each easily meets the minimum sales or transactions requirement of the Act, but none collects South Dakota sales tax.  2017 S.\xc2\xa0D. 56, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 901 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 754, 759\xe2\x80\x93760.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Pursuant to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions for expeditious judicial review, South Dakota filed a declaratory judgment action against respondents in state court, seeking a declaration that the requirements of the Act are valid and applicable to respondents and an injunction requiring respondents to register for licenses to collect and remit sales tax.  App. 11, 30.  Respondents moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Act is unconstitutional.  901 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 759\xe2\x80\x93760.

The Commerce Clause \xe2\x80\x9creflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hughes</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322, 325\xe2\x80\x93326 (1979).  Although the Commerce Clause is written as an affirmative grant of authority to Congress, this Court has long held that in some instances it imposes limitations on the States absent congressional action.  Of course, when Congress exercises its power to regulate commerce by enacting legislation, the legislation controls.  <i>Southern Pacific Co.</i> v. <i>Arizona ex rel.

Chief Justice Marshall explained that commerce included both \xe2\x80\x9cthe interchange of commodities\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial intercourse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 189, 193.  A concurring opinion further stated that Congress had the exclusive power to regulate commerce.  See <i>id.,</i> at 236 (opinion of Johnson, J.).  Had that latter submission prevailed and States been denied the power of concurrent regulation, history might have seen sweeping federal regulations at an early date that foreclosed the States from experimentation with laws and policies of their own, or, on the other hand, proposals to reexamine <i>Gibbons</i>\xe2\x80\x99 broad definition of commerce to accommodate the necessity of allowing States the power to enact laws to implement the political will of their people.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just five years after <i>Gibbons</i>, however, in another opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, the Court sustained what in substance was a state regulation of interstate commerce.  In <i>Willson</i> v. <i>Black Bird Creek Marsh Co.</i>, 2 Pet. 245 (1829), the Court allowed a State to dam and bank a stream that was part of an interstate water system, an action that likely would have been an impermissible intrusion on the national power over commerce had it been the rule that only Congress could regulate in that sphere.  See <i>id., </i>at 252.  Thus, by implication at least, the Court indicated that the power to regulate commerce in some circumstances was held by the States and Congress concurrently.  And so both a broad interpretation of interstate commerce and the concurrent regulatory power of the States can be traced to <i>Gibbons</i> and <i>Willson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Over the next few decades, the Court refined the doctrine to accommodate the necessary balance between state and federal power.  In <i>Cooley</i> v. <i>Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots</i>, 12 How. 299 (1852), the Court addressed local laws regulating river pilots who operated in interstate waters and guided many ships on interstate or foreign voyages.  The Court held that, while Congress surely could regulate on this subject had it chosen to act, the State, too, could regulate.  The Court distinguished between those subjects that by their nature \xe2\x80\x9cimperatively deman[d] a single uniform rule, operating equally on the commerce of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and those that \xe2\x80\x9cdeman[d] th[e] diversity, which alone can meet .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. local necessities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 319.  Though considerable uncertainties were yet to be overcome, these precedents still laid the groundwork for the analytical framework that now prevails for Commerce Clause cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine has developed further with time.  Modern precedents rest upon two primary principles that mark the boundaries of a State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate interstate commerce.  First, state regulations may not discriminate against interstate commerce; and second, States may not impose undue burdens on interstate commerce.  State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face \xe2\x80\x9ca virtually <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i> rule of invalidity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Granholm</i> v. <i>Heald</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460, 476 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  State laws that \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[e] even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137, 142 (1970); see also <i>Southern Pacific</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 779.  Al- though subject to exceptions and variations, see, <i>e.g., Hughes</i> v. <i>Alexandria Scrap Corp.</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 794 (1976); <i>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.</i> v. <i>New York State Liquor Authority</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573 (1986), these two principles guide the courts in adjudicating cases challenging state laws under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">These principles also animate the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause precedents addressing the validity of state taxes.  The Court explained the now-accepted framework for state taxation in <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 274 (1977).  The Court held that a State \xe2\x80\x9cmay tax exclusively interstate commerce so long as the tax does not create any effect forbidden by the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 285.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>D. H. Holmes Co.</i> v. <i>McNamara</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24, 31 (1988).  The Court will sustain a tax so long as it (1) applies to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, (2) is fairly apportioned, (3) does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4) is fairly related to the services the State provides.  See <i>Complete Auto</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 279.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before <i>Complete Auto</i>, the Court had addressed a challenge to an Illinois tax that required out-of-state retailers to collect and remit taxes on sales made to consumers who purchased goods for use within Illinois.  <i>Bellas Hess</i>, 386 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 754\xe2\x80\x93755.  The Court held that a mail-order company \xe2\x80\x9cwhose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or the United States mail\xe2\x80\x9d lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State required by both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause.  <i>Id., </i>at 758.  Unless the retailer maintained a physical presence such as \xe2\x80\x9cretail outlets, solicitors, or property within a State,\xe2\x80\x9d the State lacked the power to require that retailer to collect a local use tax.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The dissent dis- agreed: \xe2\x80\x9cThere should be no doubt that this large-scale, systematic, continuous solicitation and exploitation of the Illinois consumer market is a sufficient \xe2\x80\x98nexus\xe2\x80\x99 to require Bellas Hess to collect from Illinois customers and to remit the use tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 761\xe2\x80\x93762 (opinion of Fortas, J., joined by Black and Douglas, JJ.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1992, the Court reexamined the physical presence rule in <i>Quill</i>.  That case presented a challenge to North Dakota\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to require an out-of-state mail-order house that has neither outlets nor sales representatives in the State to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301.  Despite the fact that <i>Bellas Hess</i> linked due process and the Commerce Clause together, the Court in <i>Quill </i>overruled the due process holding, but not the Commerce Clause holding; and it thus reaffirmed the physical presence rule.  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 307\xe2\x80\x93308, 317\xe2\x80\x93318.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court in <i>Quill </i>recognized that intervening precedents, specifically <i>Complete Auto</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cmight not dictate the same result were the issue to arise for the first time today.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311.  But, nevertheless, the <i>Quill </i>majority concluded that the physical presence rule was necessary to prevent undue burdens on interstate commerce.  <i>Id., </i>at 313, and n.\xc2\xa06.  It grounded the physical presence rule in <i>Complete Auto</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a tax have a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial nexus\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with the activity being taxed.  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three Justices based their decision to uphold the physical presence rule on <i>stare decisis</i> alone.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 320 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Dissenting in relevant part, Justice White argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no relationship between the physical-presence/nexus rule the Court retains and Commerce Clause considerations that allegedly justify it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 327 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The physical presence rule<i> </i>has \xe2\x80\x9cbeen the target of criticism over many years from many quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Direct Marketing Assn.</i> v. <i>Brohl</i>, 814 F.\xc2\xa03d 1129, 1148, 1150\xe2\x80\x931151 (CA10 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  <i>Quill</i>, it has been said,<i> </i>was \xe2\x80\x9cpremised on assumptions that are unfounded\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9criddled with internal inconsistencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rothfeld, <i>Quill</i>: Confusing the Commerce Clause, 56 Tax Notes 487, 488 (1992<i>).</i> <i>Quill</i> created an inefficient \xe2\x80\x9conline sales tax loophole\xe2\x80\x9d that gives out-of-state businesses an advantage.  A. Laffer &amp; D. Arduin, Pro-Growth Tax Reform and E-Fairness 1, 4 (July 2013).  And \xe2\x80\x9cwhile nexus rules are clearly necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court \xe2\x80\x9cshould focus on rules that are appropriate to the twenty-first century, not the nineteenth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hellerstein, Deconstructing the Debate Over State Taxation of Electronic Commerce, 13 Harv. J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Tech. 549, 553 (2000).  Each year, the physical presence rule becomes further removed from economic reality and results in significant revenue losses to the States.  These critiques underscore that the physical presence rule, both as first formulated and as applied today, is an incorrect interpretation of the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Quill </i>is flawed on its own terms.  First, the physical presence rule is not a necessary interpretation of the requirement that a state tax must be \xe2\x80\x9capplied to an activ- ity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Complete Auto</i>, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 279.  Second, <i>Quill </i>creates rather than resolves market distortions.  And third, <i>Quill</i> im- poses the sort of arbitrary, formalistic distinction that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s modern Commerce Clause precedents disavow.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">All agree that South Dakota has the authority to tax these transactions.  S. B. 106 applies to sales of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible personal property, products transferred electronically, or services <i>for delivery into South Dakota</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cIt has long been settled\xe2\x80\x9d that the sale of goods or services \xe2\x80\x9chas a sufficient nexus to the State in which the sale is consummated to be treated as a local transaction taxable by that State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Jefferson Lines, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 175, 184 (1995); see also 2 C.

The Court has previously stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he imposition on the seller of the duty to insure collection of the tax from the purchaser does not violate the [C]ommerce [C]lause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McGoldrick</i> v. <i>Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, 50, n. 9 (1940).  It is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98familiar and sanctioned device.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Scripto, Inc. </i>v.<i> Carson</i>,\n\n362 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207, 212 (1960).  There just must be \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial nexus with the taxing State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Complete Auto</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 279.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This nexus requirement is \xe2\x80\x9cclosely related,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bellas Hess</i>, 386 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 756, to the due process requirement that there be \xe2\x80\x9csome definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Miller Brothers Co.</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 340, 344\xe2\x80\x93345 (1954).  It is settled law that a business need not have a physical presence in a State to satisfy the demands of due process.  <i>Burger King Corp.</i> v. <i>Rudzewicz</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462, 476 (1985).  Although physical presence \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98frequently will enhance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a business\xe2\x80\x99 connection with a State, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [with no] need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Quill</i>,<i> </i>504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308.  <i>Quill </i>itself recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he requirements of due process are met irrespective of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s lack of physical presence in the taxing State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When considering whether a State may levy a tax, Due Process and Commerce Clause standards may not be identical or coterminous, but there are significant parallels.  The reasons given in <i>Quill </i>for rejecting the physical presence rule for due process purposes apply as well to the question whether physical presence is a requisite for an out-of-state seller\xe2\x80\x99s liability to remit sales taxes.  Physical presence is not necessary to create a substantial nexus.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Quill </i>majority expressed concern that without the physical presence rule \xe2\x80\x9ca state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d by subjecting retailers to tax-collection obligations in thousands of different taxing jurisdictions.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 313, n.\xc2\xa06.  But the administrative costs of compliance, especially in the modern economy with its Internet technology, are largely unrelated to whether a company happens to have a physical presence in a State.  For example, a business with one salesperson in each State must collect sales taxes in every jurisdiction in which goods are delivered; but a business with 500 salespersons in one central location and a website accessible in every State need not collect sales taxes on otherwise identical nationwide sales.  In other words, under <i>Quill</i>, a small company with diverse physical presence might be equally or more burdened by compliance costs than a large remote seller.  The physical presence rule is a poor proxy for the compliance costs faced by companies that do business in multiple States.  Other aspects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine can better and more accurately address any potential burdens on interstate commerce, whether or not <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence rule is satisfied.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court has consistently explained that the Commerce Clause was designed to prevent States from engaging in economic discrimination so they would not divide into isolated, separable units.  See <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 617, 623 (1978).  But it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot the purpose of the [C]ommerce [C]lause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Complete Auto</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 288 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it is certainly not the purpose of the Commerce Clause to permit the Judiciary to create market distortions.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Commerce Clause was intended to put businesses on an even playing field, the [physical presence] rule is hardly a way to achieve that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Quill</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 329 (opinion of White, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Quill</i> puts both local businesses and many interstate businesses with physical presence at a competitive disadvantage relative to remote sellers.  Remote sellers can avoid the regulatory burdens of tax collection and can offer <i>de\xc2\xa0facto</i> lower prices caused by the widespread failure of consumers to pay the tax on their own.  This \xe2\x80\x9cguarantees a competitive benefit to certain firms simply because of the organizational form they choose\xe2\x80\x9d while the rest of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9cis all about preventing discrimination between firms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Direct Marketing</i>, 814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1150\xe2\x80\x931151 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  In effect, <i>Quill</i> has come to serve as a judicially created tax shelter for businesses that decide to limit their physical presence and still sell their goods and services to a State\xe2\x80\x99s consumers\xe2\x80\x94something that has become easier and more prevalent as technology has advanced.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worse still, the rule produces an incentive to avoid physical presence in multiple States.  Distortions caused by the desire of businesses to avoid tax collection mean that the market may currently lack storefronts, distribution points, and employment centers that otherwise would be efficient or desirable.  The Commerce Clause must not prefer interstate commerce only to the point where a merchant physically crosses state borders.  Rejecting the physical presence rule is necessary to ensure that artificial competitive advantages are not created by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  This Court should not prevent States from collecting lawful taxes through a physical presence rule that can be satisfied only if there is an employee or a building in the State.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause jurisprudence has \xe2\x80\x9ceschewed formalism for a sensitive, case-by-case analysis of purposes and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>West Lynn Creamery, Inc.</i> v. <i>Healy</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 201 (1994).  <i>Quill</i>, in contrast, treats economically identical actors differently, and for arbitrary reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider, for example, two businesses that sell furniture online.  The first stocks a few items of inventory in a small warehouse in North Sioux City, South Dakota.  The second uses a major warehouse just across the border in South Sioux City, Nebraska, and maintains a sophisticated website with a virtual showroom accessible in every State, including South Dakota.  By reason of its physical presence, the first business must collect and remit a tax on all of its sales to customers from South Dakota, even those sales that have nothing to do with the warehouse.  See <i>National Geographic</i>, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561; <i>Scripto, Inc.</i>, 362 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211\xe2\x80\x93212.  But, under <i>Quill</i>, the second, hypothetical seller cannot be subject to the same tax for the sales of the same items made through a pervasive Internet presence.  This distinction simply makes no sense.  So long as a state law avoids \xe2\x80\x9cany effect forbidden by the Commerce Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Complete Auto</i>, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 285, courts should not rely on anachronistic formalisms to invalidate it.  The basic principles of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause jurisprudence are grounded in functional, marketplace dynamics; and States can and should consider those realities in enacting and enforcing their tax laws.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The <i>Quill </i>Court<i> </i>itself acknowledged that the physical presence rule is \xe2\x80\x9cartificial at its edges.\xe2\x80\x9d 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 315.  That was an understatement when <i>Quill </i>was decided; and when the day-to-day functions of marketing and distribution in the modern economy are considered, it is all the more evident that the physical presence rule is artificial in its entirety.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Modern e-commerce does not align analytically with a test that relies on the sort of physical presence defined in <i>Quill</i>.  In a footnote, <i>Quill </i>rejected the argument that \xe2\x80\x9ctitle to \xe2\x80\x98a few floppy diskettes\xe2\x80\x99 present in a State\xe2\x80\x9d was sufficient to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 315, n.\xc2\xa08.  But it is not clear why a single employee or a single warehouse should create a substantial nexus while \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d aspects of pervasive modern technology should not.  For example, a company with a website accessible in South Dakota may be said to have a physical presence in the State via the customers\xe2\x80\x99 computers.  A website may leave cookies saved to the customers\xe2\x80\x99 hard drives, or customers may download the company\xe2\x80\x99s app onto their phones.  Or a company may lease data storage that is permanently, or even occasionally, located in South Dakota.  Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Microsoft Corp.</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018) (<i>per curiam</i>).

A virtual showroom can show far more inventory, in far more detail, and with greater opportunities for consumer and seller interaction than might be possible for local stores.  Yet the continuous and pervasive virtual presence of retailers today is, under <i>Quill</i>, simply irrelevant.  This Court should not maintain a rule that ignores these substantial virtual connections to the State.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The physical presence rule as defined and enforced in <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill</i> is not just a technical legal problem\xe2\x80\x94it<i> </i>is an extraordinary imposition by the Judiciary on States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to collect taxes and perform critical public functions.  Forty-one States, two Territories, and the District of Columbia now ask this Court to reject the test formulated in <i>Quill</i>.  See Brief for Colorado et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i>.  <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence rule intrudes on States\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable choices in enacting their tax systems.  And that it allows remote sellers to escape an obligation to remit a lawful state tax is unfair and unjust.  It is unfair and unjust to those competitors, both local and out of State, who must remit the tax; to the consumers who pay the tax; and to the States that seek fair enforcement of the sales tax, a tax many States for many years have considered an indispensable source for raising revenue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In essence, respondents ask this Court to retain a rule that allows their customers to escape payment of sales taxes\xe2\x80\x94taxes that are essential to create and secure the active market they supply with goods and services.  An example may suffice.  Wayfair offers to sell a vast selection of furnishings.  Its advertising seeks to create an image of beautiful, peaceful homes, but it also says that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]ne of the best things about buying through Wayfair is that we do not have to charge sales tax.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 55.  What Wayfair ignores in its subtle offer to assist in tax evasion is that creating a dream home assumes solvent state and local governments.

But there is nothing unfair about requiring companies that avail themselves of the States\xe2\x80\x99 benefits to bear an equal share of the burden of tax collection.  Fairness dictates quite the opposite result.  Helping respondents\xe2\x80\x99 customers evade a lawful tax unfairly shifts to those consumers who buy from their competitors with a physical presence that satisfies <i>Quill</i>\xe2\x80\x94even one warehouse or one salesperson\xe2\x80\x94an increased share of the taxes.  It is essential to public confidence in the tax system that the Court avoid creating inequitable exceptions.  This is also essential to the confidence placed in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause decisions.  Yet the physical presence rule undermines that necessary confidence by giving some online retailers an arbitrary advantage over their competitors who collect state sales taxes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the name of federalism and free markets, <i>Quill </i>does harm to both.  The physical presence rule it defines has limited States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>Although we approach the reconsideration of our decisions with the utmost caution, <i>stare decisis</i> is not an inexorable command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pearson</i> v. <i>Callahan</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, 233 (2009) (quoting <i>State Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Khan</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 3, 20 (1997); alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).<i> </i>Here, <i>stare decisis</i> can no longer support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of a valid exercise of the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If it becomes apparent that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause decisions prohibit the States from exercising their lawful sovereign powers in our federal system, the Court should be vigilant in correcting the error.  While it can be conceded that Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.  It is inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s own creation.  Courts have acted as the front line of review in this limited sphere; and hence it is important that their principles be accurate and logical, whether or not Congress can or will act in response.  It is currently the Court, and not Congress, that is limiting the lawful prerogatives of the States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, the real world implementation of Commerce Clause doctrines now makes it manifest that the physical presence rule as defined by <i>Quill </i>must give way to the \xe2\x80\x9cfar-reaching systemic and structural changes in the economy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmany other societal dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d caused by the Cyber Age.  <i>Direct Marketing</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  Though <i>Quill </i>was wrong on its own terms when it was decided in 1992, since then the Internet revolution has made its earlier error all the more egregious and harmful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Quill </i>Court did not have before it the present realities of the interstate marketplace.  In 1992, less than 2 percent of Americans had Internet access.  See Brief for Retail Litigation Center, Inc., et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11, and n.\xc2\xa010.  Today that number is about 89 percent.  <i>Ibid., </i>and n.\xc2\xa011.  When it decided <i>Quill</i>, the Court could not have envisioned a world in which the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest retailer would be a remote seller, S. Li, Amazon Overtakes Wal-Mart as Biggest Retailer, L.\xc2\xa0A. Times, July 24, 2015, http://www. latimes.com/business/la-fi-amazon-walmart-20150724-story.html (all Internet materials as last visited June 18, 2018).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Internet\xe2\x80\x99s prevalence and power have changed the dynamics of the national economy.  In 1992, mail-order sales in the United States totaled $180 billion.  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329 (opinion of White, J.).  Last year, e-commerce retail sales alone were estimated at $453.5 billion.  Dept. of Commerce, U.\xc2\xa0S. Census Bureau News, Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales: 4th Quarter 2017 (CB18\xe2\x80\x9321, Feb. 16, 2018).  Combined with traditional remote sellers, the total exceeds half a trillion dollars.  Sales Taxes Report, at 9.  Since the Department of Commerce first began tracking e-commerce sales, those sales have increased tenfold from 0.8 percent to 8.9 percent of total retail sales in the United States.  Compare Dept. of Commerce, U.\xc2\xa0S. Census Bureau, Retail E-Commerce Sales in Fourth Quarter 2000 (CB01\xe2\x80\x9328, Feb. 16, 2001), https://www.census.gov/mrts/ www/data/pdf/00Q4.pdf, with U.\xc2\xa0S. Census Bureau News, Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales: 4th Quarter 2017.  And it is likely that this percentage will increase.  Last year, e-commerce grew at four times the rate of traditional retail, and it shows no sign of any slower pace.  See <i>ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This expansion has also increased the revenue shortfall faced by States seeking to collect their sales and use taxes.  In 1992, it was estimated that the States were losing between $694 million and $3 billion per year in sales tax revenues as a result of the physical presence rule.  Brief for Law Professors et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11, n.\xc2\xa07.  Now estimates range from $8 to $33 billion.  Sales Taxes Report, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312; Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  The South Dakota Legislature has declared an emergency, S. B. 106, \xc2\xa79, which again demonstrates urgency of overturning the physical presence rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The argument, moreover, that the physical presence rule is clear and easy to apply is unsound.  Attempts to apply the physical presence rule to online retail sales are proving unworkable.  States are already confronting the complexities of defining physical presence in the Cyber Age.  For example, Massachusetts proposed a regulation that would have defined physical presence to include making apps available to be downloaded by in-state residents and placing cookies on in-state residents\xe2\x80\x99 web browsers.  See 830 Code Mass. Regs. 64H.1.7 (2017).  Ohio recently adopted a similar standard.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75741.01(I)(2)(i) (Lexis Supp. 2018).  Some States have enacted so-called \xe2\x80\x9cclick through\xe2\x80\x9d nexus statutes, which define nexus to include out-of-state sellers that contract with in-state residents who refer customers for compensation.  See <i>e.g., </i>N.\xc2\xa0Y. Tax Law Ann. \xc2\xa71101(b)(8)(vi) (West 2017); Brief for Tax Foundation as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20\xe2\x80\x9322 (listing 21 States with similar statutes).  Others still, like Colorado, have imposed notice and reporting requirements on out-of-state retailers that fall just short of actually collecting and remitting the tax.  See <i>Direct Marketing</i>, 814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1133 (discussing Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x9321\xe2\x80\x93112(3.5)); Brief for Tax Foundation 24\xe2\x80\x9326 (listing nine States with similar statutes).  Statutes of this sort are likely to embroil courts in technical and arbitrary disputes about what counts as physical presence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reliance interests are a legitimate consideration when the Court weighs adherence to an earlier but flawed precedent.  See <i>Kimble</i> v. <i>Marvel Entertainment, LLC</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).  But even on its own terms, the physical presence rule as defined by <i>Quill </i>is no longer a clear or easily applicable standard, so arguments for reliance based on its clarity are misplaced.  And, importantly, <i>stare decisis</i> accommodates only \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate reliance interest[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ross</i>,\n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 798, 824 (1982).  Here, the tax distortion created by <i>Quill </i>exists in large part because consumers regularly fail to comply with lawful use taxes.  Some remote retailers go so far as to advertise sales as tax free.  See S. B. 106, \xc2\xa78(3); see also Brief for Petitioner 55.  A business \xe2\x80\x9cis in no position to found a constitutional right on the practical opportunities for tax avoidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nelson</i> v. <i>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359, 366 (1941).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents argue that \xe2\x80\x9cthe physical presence rule has permitted start-ups and small businesses to use the Internet as a means to grow their companies and access a national market, without exposing them to the daunting complexity and business-development obstacles of nationwide sales tax collection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 29.  These burdens may pose legitimate concerns in some instances, particularly for small businesses that make a small volume of sales to customers in many States.  State taxes differ, not only in the rate imposed but also in the categories of goods that are taxed and, sometimes, the relevant date of purchase.  Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems.  Indeed, as the physical presence rule no longer controls, those systems may well become available in a short period of time, either from private providers or from state taxing agencies themselves.  And in all events, Congress may legislate to address these problems if it deems it necessary and fit to do so. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, however, South Dakota affords small merchants a reasonable degree of protection.  The law at issue requires a merchant to collect the tax only if it does a considerable amount of business in the State; the law is not retroactive; and South Dakota is a party to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, see <i>infra </i>at 23.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, other aspects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause doctrine can protect against any undue burden on interstate commerce, taking into consideration the small businesses, startups, or others who engage in commerce across state lines.  For example, the United States argues that tax-collection requirements should be analyzed under the balancing framework of <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137.  Others have argued that retroactive liability risks a double tax burden in violation of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment jurisprudence because it would make both the buyer and the seller legally liable for collecting and remitting the tax on a transaction intended to be taxed only once.  See Brief for Law Professors et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7, n.\xc2\xa05.  Complex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.  Concerns that complex state tax systems could be a burden on small business are answered in part by noting that, as discussed below, there are various plans already in place to simplify collection; and since in-state businesses pay the taxes as well, the risk of discrimination against out-of-state sellers is avoided.  And, if some small businesses with only <i>de minimis</i> contacts seek relief from collection systems thought to be a burden, those entities may still do so under other theories.  These issues are not before the Court in the instant case; but their potential to arise in some later case cannot justify retaining this artificial, anachronistic rule that deprives States of vast revenues from major businesses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the Court concludes that the physical presence rule of <i>Quill</i> is unsound and incorrect.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <i>Quill Corp.</i> v. <i>North Dakota</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298 (1992), and <i>National Bellas Hess, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Revenue of Ill.</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753 (1967),<i> </i>should be, and now are, overruled.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the absence of <i>Quill </i>and <i>Bellas Hess</i>, the first prong of the <i>Complete Auto </i>test simply asks whether the tax applies to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State.  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 279.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]uch a nexus is established when the taxpayer [or collector] \xe2\x80\x98avails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business\xe2\x80\x99 in that jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Polar Tankers, Inc.</i> v. <i>City of Valdez</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 11 (2009).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the nexus is clearly sufficient based on both the economic and virtual contacts respondents have with the State.  The Act applies only to sellers that deliver more than $100,000 of goods or services into South Dakota or engage in 200 or more separate transactions for the delivery of goods and services into the State on an annual basis.  S. B. 106, \xc2\xa71.  This quantity of business could not have occurred unless the seller availed itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business in South Dakota.  And respondents are large, national companies that undoubtedly maintain an extensive virtual presence.  Thus, the substantial nexus requirement of <i>Complete Auto </i>is satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question remains whether some other principle in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act.  Because the <i>Quill </i>physical presence rule was an obvious barrier to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s validity, these issues have not yet been litigated or briefed, and so the Court need not resolve them here.  That said, South Dakota\xe2\x80\x99s tax system includes several features that appear designed to prevent discrimination against or undue burdens upon interstate commerce.  First, the Act applies a safe harbor to those who transact only limited business in South Dakota.  Second, the Act ensures that no obligation to remit the sales tax may be applied retroactively.  S. B. 106, \xc2\xa75.  Third, South Dakota is one of more than 20 States that have adopted the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.  This system standardizes taxes to reduce administrative and compliance costs: It requires a single, state level tax administration, uniform definitions of products and services, simplified tax rate structures, and other uniform rules.  It also provides sellers access to sales tax administration software paid for by the State.  Sellers who choose to use such software are immune from audit liability.  See App. 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Any remaining claims regarding the application of the Commerce Clause in the absence of <i>Quill </i>and <i>Bellas Hess </i>may be addressed in the first instance on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3918487">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 17\xe2\x80\x93494</p><p>_________________</p><p>SOUTH DAKOTA, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> WAYFAIR, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p><p>on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of  south dakota</p><p>[June 21, 2018 ]</p><p></p><p>Justice Gorsuch, concurring.</p><p>Our dormant commerce cases usually prevent States from discriminating between in-state and out-of-state firms.  <i>National Bellas Hess, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Revenue of Ill</i>.,386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753 (1967), and <i>Quill Corp.</i> v. <i>North Dakota</i>,504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298 (1992), do just the opposite.

The Court is right to correct the mistake and I am pleased to join its opinion.</p><p>My agreement with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the history of our dormant commerce clause jurisprudence, however, should not be mistaken for agreement with all aspects of the doctrine.  The Commerce Clause is found in Article I and authorizes <i>Congress</i> to regulate interstate commerce.  Meanwhile our dormant commerce cases suggest Article III <i>courts</i> may invalidate state laws that offend no congressional statute.  Whether and how much of this can be squared with the text of the Commerce Clause, justified by <i>stare decisis</i>, or defended as misbranded products of federalism or antidiscrimination imperatives flowing from Article IV\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges and Immunities Clause are questions for another day.

We postulated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe better part of both wisdom and valor [may be] to respect the judgment of the other branches of the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 319; see <i>id.,</i> at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (recognizing that <i>stare decisis</i> has \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force\xe2\x80\x9d in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinal say over regulation of interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d).<i> </i>The Court thus left it to Congress \xe2\x80\x9cto decide whether, when, and to what extent the States may burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to collect use taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 318 (majority opinion).  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This is neither the first, nor the second, but the third<i> </i>time this Court has been asked whether a State may obligate sellers with no physical presence within its borders to collect tax on sales to residents.  Whatever salience the adage \xe2\x80\x9cthird time\xe2\x80\x99s a charm\xe2\x80\x9d has in daily life, it is a poor guide to Supreme Court decisionmaking.  If <i>stare decisis</i> applied with special force in <i>Quill</i>, it should be an even greater impediment to overruling precedent now, particularly since this Court in <i>Quill</i> \xe2\x80\x9ctossed [the ball] into Congress\xe2\x80\x99s court, for acceptance or not as that branch elects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kimble</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); see <i>Quill</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress is now free to decide\xe2\x80\x9d the circumstances in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe States may burden interstate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. concerns with a duty to collect use taxes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress has in fact been considering whether to alter the rule established in <i>Bellas Hess</i> for some time.  See Addendum to Brief for Four United States Senators as <i>Amici Curiae </i>1\xe2\x80\x934 (compiling efforts by Congress between 2001 and 2017 to pass legislation respecting interstate sales tax collection); Brief for Rep. Bob Goodlatte et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>20\xe2\x80\x9323 (Goodlatte Brief) (same).  Three bills addressing the issue are currently pending.  See Marketplace Fairness Act of 2017, S. 976, 115th Cong., 1st Sess. (2017); Remote Transactions Parity Act of 2017, H.\xc2\xa0R. 2193, 115th Cong., 1st Sess. (2017); No Regulation Without Representation Act, H. R. 2887, 115th Cong., 1st Sess. (2017).  Nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision precludes Congress from continuing to seek a legislative solution.  But by suddenly changing the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the issue.  Armed with today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, state officials can be expected to redirect their attention from working with Congress on a national solution, to securing new tax revenue from remote retailers.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Sen. Ted Cruz et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (\xe2\x80\x9cOverturning <i>Quill </i>would undo much of Con- gress\xe2\x80\x99 work to find a workable national compromise under the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court proceeds with an inexplicable sense of urgency.  It asserts that the passage of time is only increasing  the need to take the extraordinary step of overruling <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cEach year, the physical presence rule becomes further removed from economic reality and results in significant revenue losses to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  The factual predicates for that assertion include a Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimate that, under the physical-presence rule, States lose billions of dollars annually in sales tax revenue.  See <i>ante</i>, at 2, 19 (citing GAO, Report to Congressional Requesters: Sales Taxes, States Could Gain Revenue from Expanded Authority, but Businesses Are Likely to Experience Compliance Costs 5 (GAO\xe2\x80\x9318\xe2\x80\x93114, Nov. 2017) (Sales Taxes Report)).  But evidence in the same GAO report indicates that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, and has been for some time.  States and local governments are already able to collect approximately 80 percent of the tax revenue that would be available if there were no physical-presence rule.  See Sales Taxes Report 8.  Among the top 100 Internet retailers that rate is between 87 and 96 percent.  See <i>id.,</i> at 41.  Some companies, including the online behemoth Amazon,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]* now voluntarily collect and remit sales tax in every State that assesses one\xe2\x80\x94even those in which they have no physical presence.  See <i>id.,</i> at 10.  To the extent the physical-presence rule is harming States, the harm is apparently receding with time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court rests its decision to overrule <i>Bellas Hess </i>on the \xe2\x80\x9cpresent realities of the interstate marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 18.  As the Court puts it, allowing remote sellers to escape remitting a lawful tax is \xe2\x80\x9cunfair and unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nfair and unjust to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. competitors .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. who must remit the tax; to the consumers who pay the tax; and to the States that seek fair enforcement of the sales tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe present realities of the interstate marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d include the possibility that the marketplace itself could be affected by abandoning the physical-presence rule.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on unfairness and injustice does not appear to embrace consideration of that current public policy concern.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, for example, breezily disregards the costs that its decision will impose on retailers.  Correctly calculating and remitting sales taxes on all e-commerce sales will likely prove baffling for many retailers.  Over 10,000 jurisdictions levy sales taxes, each with \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent tax rates, different rules governing tax-exempt goods and services, different product category definitions, and different standards for determining whether an out-of-state seller has a substantial presence\xe2\x80\x9d in the jurisdiction.  Sales Taxes Report 3.  A few examples: New Jersey knitters pay sales tax on yarn purchased for art projects, but not on yarn earmarked for sweaters.  See Brief for eBay, Inc., et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8, n.\xc2\xa03 (eBay Brief\xc2\xa0).  Texas taxes sales of plain deodorant at 6.25 percent but imposes no tax on deodorant with antiperspirant.  See <i>id.</i>, at 7.  Illinois categorizes Twix and Snickers bars\xe2\x80\x94chocolate-and-caramel confections usually displayed side-by-side in the candy aisle\xe2\x80\x94as food and candy, respectively (Twix have flour; Snickers don\xe2\x80\x99t), and taxes them differently.  See <i>id.,</i> at 8; Brief for Etsy, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14\xe2\x80\x9317 (Etsy Brief\xc2\xa0) (providing additional illustrations).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The burden will fall disproportionately on small businesses.  One vitalizing effect of the Internet has been connecting small, even \xe2\x80\x9cmicro\xe2\x80\x9d businesses to potential buyers across the Nation.  People starting a business selling their embroidered pillowcases or carved decoys can offer their wares throughout the country\xe2\x80\x94but probably not if they have to figure out the tax due on every sale.  See Sales Taxes Report 22 (indicating that \xe2\x80\x9ccosts will likely increase the most for businesses that do not have established legal teams, software systems, or outside counsel to assist with compliance related questions\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the software said to facilitate compliance is still in its infancy, and its capabilities and expense are subject to debate.  See Etsy Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9319 (describing the inadequacies of such software); eBay Brief 8\xe2\x80\x9312 (same); Sales Taxes Report 16\xe2\x80\x9320 (concluding that businesses will incur \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d compliance costs).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today will surely have the effect of dampening opportunities for commerce in a broad range of new markets.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A good reason to leave these matters to Congress is that legislators may more directly consider the competing interests at stake.  Unlike this Court, Congress has the flexibility to address these questions in a wide variety of ways.  As we have said in other dormant Commerce Clause cases, Congress \xe2\x80\x9chas the capacity to investigate and analyze facts beyond anything the Judiciary could match.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>General Motors Corp. </i>v. <i>Tracy</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 278, 309 (1997); see <i>Department of Revenue of Ky.</i> v. <i>Davis</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 328, 356 (2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, after investigation, Congress could reasonably decide that current trends might sufficiently expand tax revenues, obviating the need for an abrupt policy shift with potentially adverse consequences for e-commerce.  Or Congress might decide that the benefits of allowing States to secure additional tax revenue outweigh any foreseeable harm to e-commerce.  Or Congress might elect to accommodate these competing interests, by, for example, allowing States to tax Internet sales by remote retailers only if revenue from such sales exceeds some set amount per year.  See Goodlatte Brief 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (providing varied examples of how Congress could address sales tax collection).  In any event, Congress can focus directly on current policy concerns rather than past legal mistakes.  Congress can also provide a nuanced answer to the troubling question whether any change will have retroactive effect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An erroneous decision from this Court may well  have been an unintended factor contributing to the  growth of e-commerce.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> W. Taylor, Who\xe2\x80\x99s Writing the Book on Web Business? Fast Company (Oct. 31, 1996), https:\xc2\xa0//\xc2\xa0www.fastcompany.com\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa027309\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0whos-writing-book-web-business.  The Court is of course correct that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy has changed dramatically since the time that <i>Bellas Hess </i>and <i>Quill </i>roamed the earth.  I fear the Court today is compounding its past error by trying to fix it in a totally different era.  The Constitution gives Congress the power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.  I would let Congress decide whether to depart from the physical-presence rule that has governed this area for half a century.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">*\xc2\xa0C.
