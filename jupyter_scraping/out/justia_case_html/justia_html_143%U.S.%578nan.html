An act was passed by Congress to prevent the introduction of contagious diseases into the United States, and establishing the National Board of Health, to consist of seven members, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,</p>\n<p>"whose compensation, during the time when actually engaged in the performance of their duties under this act, shall be ten dollars <em>per diem</em> each, and reasonable expenses,"</p>\n<p>four members of the board to be detailed from the army, navy, marine hospital service, and the Department of Justice, respectively, and to receive no compensation.  The sum of $50,000 was appropriated "to pay the salaries and expenses" of the board, and "to carry out the purposes" of the act.  20 Stat. 484, c. 202.</p>\n<p><em>April</em> 5, 1879.  The appellant, Dunwoody, was appointed by the board its chief clerk, with compensation at the rate of $100 per month, dating from April 3, 1879.</p>\n<p><em>June</em> 2, 1879.  Congress passed an act to prevent the introduction of contagious or infectious diseases into the United States, requiring the National Board of Health to cooperate with, and, so far as it lawfully might, aid state and municipal boards of health to that end.  The act appropriated $500,000, or so much thereof as might be necessary, to meet the expenses incurred in carrying out its provisions, and to be disbursed by the Secretary of the Treasury on estimates made by the National Board of Health and approved by him.  This act was to continue in force four years.  21 Stat. 5, 8, c. 11.</p>\n<p><em>June</em> 5, 1879.  Dunwoody was nominated by the board to the Secretary of the Treasury as its disbursing clerk.</p>\n<p><em>June</em> 6, 1879.  The Secretary sent to Dunwoody this communication:</p>\n<p>"Upon the recommendation of the National Board of Health, you are hereby appointed a disbursing agent of this department for the purpose of disbursing the funds appropriated by Congress for the National Board of Health; this appointment to be without compensation.  You will be requested to furnish a bond, with two or more sureties, in the penal sum of $20,000."</p>\n<p>The bond so required was given. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="580">Page 143 U.

An act was passed authorizing the board to procure suitable offices for the transaction of its business at a rent not exceeding $1,800 a year, and to pay past rent, and providing:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 5.  That the chief clerk of the National Board of Health shall act as disbursing agent for the board, and shall give bond, conformably to \xc2\xa7 176 of the Revised Statutes, for the faithful performance of that duty, and for such service he shall receive $300 per annum, in addition to his salary as chief clerk, and the Board of Health may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, pay to its Secretary such sum, in addition to his pay as a member of the board, as it may deem proper, not exceeding $100 per month."</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 7.  That all the money hereinbefore authorized to be expended and all contracts made and liabilities incurred by the National Board of Health shall be paid out of the appropriation of five hundred thousand dollars made in the act of Congress . . . approved June 2, 1879."</p>\n<p>21 Stat. 46, c. 61.</p>\n<p><em>June</em> 16, 1880.

During the recess of the Senate, the President appointed Dunwoody from civil life, a member of the National Board of Health, and, on the 4th of December of the same year, appointed him to that position by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Immediately upon his appointment as a member of the board, he was designated by it as its secretary.  An order was made by the board -- on what day it does not appear -- appointing him its Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury -- which order was not revoked -- with pay at the rate of $100 per month in addition to his pay as a member of the board.  He continued to be Secretary, and performed duty as such from November, 1884, to the filing of the petition herein, August 18, 1886.  He has received no compensation as Secretary. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="583">Page 143 U. S. 583</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>March</em> 3, 1885.

S. 585</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Does this case come within the principle announced in <em>United States v. Langston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/389/case.html">118 U. S. 389</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/394/case.html">118 U. S. 394</a></span>?  Langston was minister resident and consul general of the United States at the Republic of Hayti from September 28, 1877, until July 24, 1885, under a statute providing for a diplomatic representative of the United States to the Republic of Hayti at an annual salary of $7,500.  That amount was annually appropriated for the salary of that officer from the creation of the office until 1883.  But the diplomatic and consular appropriation acts for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1883, 1884, and 1885, appropriated only $5,000 for the minister of Hayti.  And the question was whether Langston was entitled to $7,500 for each of the fiscal years last named.  This Court said:</p>\n<p>"While the case is not free from difficulty, the Court is of opinion that, according to the settled rules of interpretation, a statute fixing the annual salary of a public officer at a named sum, without limitation as to time, should not be deemed abrogated or suspended by subsequent enactments which merely appropriated a less amount for the services of that officer for particular fiscal years and which contained no words that expressly, or by clear implication, modified or repealed the previous law."</p>\n<p>We do not think the present case comes within the principle of Langston\'s case.  While the act of 1879, establishing the National Board of Health, may be said to have created the office of member of that board, with a fixed salary and without express limitation as to time, the accompanying appropriation of a round sum to pay "the salaries and expenses" of the board, and to "carry out the purposes" of the act, indicates that Congress intended that sum to be the limit of expenditure for such objects unless further appropriations were made.  But all doubt upon this subject is removed by subsequent legislation.  The Act of June 2, 1879, appropriating $500,000 to be disbursed on estimates to be furnished by the board to the Secretary of the Treasury expired, by limitation on the second of June, 1883, and that of July 1, 1879, required all money authorized by it to be expended, and all contracts and liabilities incurred by the board, to be paid out of the appropriation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 143 U. S. 586</a></p><p> of $500,000.  The appropriation of $75,000 by the Act of June 16, 1880, was for salaries and expenses of the board, and to carry out the purposes of the various acts creating it.  That made by the Act of March 3, 1881, for "salaries and expenses" of the board, was accompanied by a direction that no more money should be expended for the purposes of the various acts creating it, out of any appropriations previously made, or by virtue of any previous law, and the act of 1882 expressly provided that "no other public money than that hereby appropriated shall be expended for the purposes of the Board of Health."  These enactments evince the purpose upon the part of Congress not to create any liability upon the part of the United States in respect to the work of the National Board of Health beyond the amounts specifically appropriated by it from time to time for that work.  This purpose, if not clearly indicated by the act of 1879 establishing the board, became manifest before the plaintiff rendered the services for which, in this action, he claims compensation as upon an implied contract.  If the plaintiff is equitably entitled to be paid for any of the services in question rendered by him as a member of the board, and if the special appropriation made for the salaries and expenses of its officers and employees have been exhausted, his appeal must be made to Congress.  Looking at all the acts of Congress passed before he became a member of the board, it is clear that he did not perform services as such member under any implied contract that he should be compensated otherwise than out of the moneys specially appropriated to meet the expenses incurred by the board in the performance of the duties imposed upon it.  In other words, that board had no authority to incur any liability upon the part of the government for salaries or other expenses in excess of the amounts appropriated by Congress for such purposes.</p>\n<p>These views dispose of the case adversely to the plaintiff as to his claim for compensation as a member of the board.  There is still less ground for a judgment in his favor in respect to services rendered as chief clerk, disbursing agent, and secretary.  Congress never intended to incur liability for such services beyond the sums appropriated from time to time for the work of the Board of Health.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
