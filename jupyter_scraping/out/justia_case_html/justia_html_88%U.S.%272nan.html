United States,</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/272/case.html">*</a></span> ruled that this was no defense to the action.  The defendant excepted and brought this writ of error.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Dair v. United States,</em> just mentioned, two persons, as sureties, signed a bond to the government at the instance of a third person, who had signed it as principal, the two signing as sureties doing so upon the condition that the instrument was not to be delivered to the government until it should have been executed by a third person named, as surety, and then placing it in the hands of the person who had signed it as principal, who without the performance of the condition and without the consent of the two persons signing as sureties delivered the bond to the government, the bond being regular on its face and the government having had no notice of the condition, but where, on suit by the United States, the parties who had signed as sureties were held by this Court bound.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We cannot distinguish this case in principle from <em>Dair v. United States.</em>  The printed form, with its blank spaces, was signed by Butler and delivered to Emory with authority to fill the blanks and perfect the instrument as a bond to secure his faithful service in the office of collector of internal revenue.  He was also authorized to present it when perfected to the proper officer of the government for approval and acceptance.  If accepted, it was expected that he would at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="275">Page 88 U. S. 275</a></p><p> once be permitted to enter upon the performance of the duties of the office to which it referred.</p>\n<p>It is true that according to the plea this authority was accompanied by certain private understandings between the parties intended to limit its operations, but it was apparently unqualified.  Every blank space in the form was open.  To all appearances, any sum that should be required by the government might be designated as the penalty, and the names of any persons signing as co-sureties might be inserted in the space left for that purpose.  It was easy to have limited this authority by filling the blanks, and the filling of any one was a limitation to that extent.  By inserting in the appropriate places the amount of the penalty or the names of the sureties or their residences, Butler could have taken away from Emory the power to bind him otherwise than as thus specified.  This, however, he did not do.  Instead, he relied upon the good faith of Emory and clothed him with apparent power to fill all the blanks in the paper signed in such appropriate manner as might be necessary to convert it into a bond that would be accepted by the government as security for the performance of his contemplated official duties.  It is not pretended that the acts of Emory are beyond the scope of his apparent authority.  The bond was accepted in the belief that it had been properly executed.  There is no claim that the officer who accepted it had any notice of the private agreements.  He acted in good faith, and the question now is which of two innocent parties shall suffer.  The doctrine of <em>Dair\'s Case</em> is that it must be Butler, because he confided in Emory and the government did not.  He is in law and equity estopped by his acts from claiming, as against the government, the benefit of his private instructions to his agent.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>*  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/1/case.html">83 U.
