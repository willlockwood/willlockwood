The Act does not require notice for an abortion necessary to prevent the minor\xe2\x80\x99s death if there is insufficient time to provide notice, and permits a minor to petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification.  The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.  Respondents, who provide abortions for pregnant minors and expect to provide emergency abortions for them in the future, filed suit under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, claiming that the Act is unconstitutional because it lacks a health exception and because of the inadequacy of the life exception and the judicial bypass\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality provision.  The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement, and the First Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>If enforcing a statute that regulates access to abortion would be unconstitutional in medical emergencies, invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0As the case comes to this Court, three propositions are established.  First, States have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy.  Second, a State may not restrict access to abortions that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for preservation of the life or health of the mother.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, 879 (plurality opinion).  Third, New Hampshire has not taken issue with the case\xe2\x80\x99s factual basis:\xc2\xa0In a very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health.  New Hampshire has conceded that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Generally speaking, when confronting a statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional flaw, this Court tries to limit the solution to the problem, preferring to enjoin only the statute\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional applications while leaving the others in force, see<em> United States</em> v. <em>Raines,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 20\xe2\x80\x9322, or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 227\xe2\x80\x93229.  Three interrelated principles inform the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to remedies.  First, the Court tries not to nullify more of a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s work than is necessary.  Second, mindful that its constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, the Court restrains itself from \xe2\x80\x9crewrit[ing] state law to confirm it to constitutional requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/383/index.html">484 U. S. 383</a>, 397.  Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent.  After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, the Court must ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all?  See generally, <em>e.g., Booker, supra, </em>at 227.  Here, the courts below chose the most blunt remedy\xe2\x80\x94permanently enjoining the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement and thereby invalidating it entirely.  They need not have done so.  In <em>Stenberg</em> v. <em>Carhart,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/914/index.html">530 U. S. 914</a>\xe2\x80\x94where this Court invalidated Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpartial birth abortion\xe2\x80\x9d law in its entirety for lacking a health exception\xe2\x80\x94the parties did not ask for, and this Court did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn, but here New Hampshire asked for and respondents recognized the possibility of a more modest remedy.  Only a few applications of the Act would present a constitutional problem.  So long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the Act\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional application.  On remand, they should determine in the first instance whether the legislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invalidating the statue <em>in toto </em>should obviate any concern about the Act\xe2\x80\x99s life exception, this Court need not pass on the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 alternative holding.  If the Act survives in part on remand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents\xe2\x80\x99 separate objection to the judicial bypass\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality provision.

We hold that invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, New Hampshire enacted the Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act.  N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7132:24\xe2\x80\x93132:28 (Supp. 2004).  The Act prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor (or a woman for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed) until 48 hours after written notice of the pending abortion is delivered to her parent or guardian.  \xc2\xa7132:25(I).  Notice may be delivered personally or by certified mail.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7132:25(II), (III).  Violations of the Act are subject to criminal and civil penalties.  \xc2\xa7132:27.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act allows for three circumstances in which a physician may perform an abortion without notifying the minor\xe2\x80\x99s parent.  First, notice is not required if \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he attending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor\xe2\x80\x99s record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor\xe2\x80\x99s death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7132:26(I)(a).  Second, a person entitled to receive notice may certify that he or she has already been notified.<em> </em>\xc2\xa7132:26(I)(b).  Finally, a minor may petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification.  The judge must so authorize if he or she finds that the minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent, or that an abortion without notification is in the minor\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.  \xc2\xa7132:26(II).  These judicial bypass proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cshall be confidential and shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,\xe2\x80\x9d and access to the courts \xe2\x80\x9cshall be afforded [to the] pregnant minor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7132:26(II)(b), (c).  The trial and appellate courts must each rule on bypass petitions within seven days.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are Dr. Wayne Goldner, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has a private practice in Manchester, and three clinics that offer reproductive health services.  All provide abortions for pregnant minors, and each anticipates having to provide emergency abortions for minors in the future.  Before the Act took effect, respondents brought suit under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the Act is unconstitutional because it fails \xe2\x80\x9cto allow a physician to provide a prompt abortion to a minor whose health would be endangered\xe2\x80\x9d by delays inherent in the Act.  App. 10 (Complaint, \xc2\xb624).  Respondents also challenged the adequacy of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s life exception and of the judicial bypass\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality provision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72201(a), and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  It held, first, that the Act was invalid for failure \xe2\x80\x9con its face \xe2\x80\xa6 to comply with the constitutional requirement that laws restricting a woman\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion must provide a health exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. </em>v. <em>Heed, </em>296 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 59, 65 (NH 2003).  It also found that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s judicial bypass would not operate expeditiously enough in medical emergencies.  In the alternative, the District Court held the Act\xe2\x80\x99s life exception unconstitutional because it requires physicians to certify with impossible precision that an abortion is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid death, and fails to protect their good faith medical judgment.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.<font b="1">  Citing our decisions in <em>Stenberg</em> v. <em>Carhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/914/index.html">530 U.

S. 113</a>, 164\xe2\x80\x93165 (1973), it observed: \xe2\x80\x9cComplementing the general undue burden standard [for reviewing abortion regulations], the Supreme Court has also identified a specific and independent constitutional requirement<em> </em>that an abortion regulation must contain an exception for the preservation of the pregnant woman\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. </em>v. <em>Heed, </em>390 F.\xc2\xa03d 53, 58 (2004).  It went on to conclude that the Act is unconstitutional because it does not contain an explicit health exception, and its judicial bypass, along with other provisions of state law, is no substitute.  The Court of Appeals further found the Act unconstitutional because, in its view, the life exception forces physicians to gamble with their patients\xe2\x80\x99 lives by prohibiting them from performing an abortion without notification until they are certain that death is imminent, and is intolerably vague.  Because the district and appellate courts permanently enjoined the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement on the basis of the above infirmities, neither reached respondents\xe2\x80\x99 objection to the judicial bypass\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality provision.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 544 U.

We now vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to reconsider its choice of remedy.</p>\n<p>\n\nII</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the case comes to us, three propositions\xe2\x80\x94two legal and one factual\xe2\x80\x94are established.  First, States unquestionably have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy, because of their \xe2\x80\x9cstrong and legitimate interest in the welfare of [their] young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hodgson</em> v. <em>Minnesota,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/index.html">497 U. S. 417</a>, 444\xe2\x80\x93445 (1990) (opinion of Stevens, J.).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Accordingly, we have long upheld state parental involvement statutes like the Act before us, and we cast no doubt on those holdings today.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lambert</em> v. <em>Wicklund</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/292/index.html">520 U.

S., at 879 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Roe</em>, 410 U.

S. 52</a>, 79 (1976).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, New Hampshire has not taken real issue with the factual basis of this litigation: In some very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors, like adult women, need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health.  See 296 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 65, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New Hampshire has maintained that in most if not all cases, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s judicial bypass and the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting harms\xe2\x80\x9d statutes should protect both physician and patient when a minor needs an immediate abortion.  See N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7627:3(I) (1996) (for criminal liability, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid harm to \xe2\x80\xa6 another is justifiable if the desirability and urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense charged\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7627:1 (similar for civil liability).  But the District Court and Court of Appeals found neither of these provisions to protect minors\xe2\x80\x99 health reliably in all emergencies.  296 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 65\xe2\x80\x9366; 390 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362.  And New Hampshire has conceded that, under our cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 2, 8, 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 14. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the question of remedy: When a statute restricting access to abortion may be applied in a manner that harms women\xe2\x80\x99s health, what is the appropriate relief?  Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem.  We prefer, for example, to enjoin only the unconstitutional applications of a statute while leaving other applications in force, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 20\xe2\x80\x9322 (1960), or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 227\xe2\x80\x93229 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three interrelated principles inform our approach to remedies.  First, we try not to nullify more of a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s work than is necessary, for we know that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Time</em>, <em>Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/641/index.html">468 U. S. 641</a>, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion).  It is axiomatic that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dahnke-Walker Milling Co.</em> v. <em>Bondurant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/257/282/index.html">257 U. S. 282</a>, 289 (1921).  Accordingly, the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule\xe2\x80\x9d is that \xe2\x80\x9cpartial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\xe2\x80\x9d such that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatute may \xe2\x80\xa6 be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brockett</em> v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/index.html">472 U. S. 491</a>, 504 (1985); see also <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a> (1985); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grace</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/index.html">461 U. S. 171</a>, 180\xe2\x80\x93183 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves from \xe2\x80\x9crewrit[ing] state law to conform it to constitutional requirements\xe2\x80\x9d even as we strive to salvage it.  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>American Booksellers Assn.</em>, <em>Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/383/index.html">484 U. S. 383</a>, 397 (1988).  Our ability to devise a judicial remedy that does not entail quintessentially legislative work often depends on how clearly we have already articulated the background constitutional rules at issue and how easily we can articulate the remedy.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grace</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 180\xe2\x80\x93183, for example, we crafted a narrow remedy much like the one we contemplate today, striking down a statute banning expressive displays only as it applied to public sidewalks near the Supreme Court but not as it applied to the Supreme Court Building itself.  We later explained that the remedy in <em>Grace</em> was a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively simple matter\xe2\x80\x9d because we had previously distinguished between sidewalks and buildings in our First Amendment jurisprudence.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U. S. 454</a>, 479, n.\xc2\xa026 (1995).  But making distinctions in a murky constitutional context, or where line-drawing is inherently complex, may call for a \xe2\x80\x9cfar more serious invasion of the legislative domain\xe2\x80\x9d than we ought to undertake.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot \xe2\x80\x9cuse its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Califano</em> v. <em>Westcott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/76/index.html">443 U. S. 76</a>, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also <em>Dorchy</em> v. <em>Kansas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/264/286/index.html">264 U. S. 286</a>, 289\xe2\x80\x93290 (1924) (opinion for the Court by Brandeis, J.).  After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, we must next ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all?

All the while, we are wary of legislatures who would rely on our intervention,<font b="1"> for \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside\xe2\x80\x9d to announce to whom the statute may be applied.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reese</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/214/index.html">92 U. S. 214</a>, 221 (1876).  \xe2\x80\x9cThis would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the courts below chose the most blunt remedy\xe2\x80\x94permanently enjoining the enforcement of New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s parental notification law and thereby invalidating it entirely.  That is understandable, for we, too, have previously invalidated an abortion statute in its entirety because of the same constitutional flaw.  In <em>Stenberg</em>, we addressed a Nebraska law banning so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpartial birth abortion\xe2\x80\x9d unless the procedure was necessary to save the pregnant woman\xe2\x80\x99s life.  We held Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s law unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception.  530 U. S., at 930 (lack of a health exception was an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent reaso[n]\xe2\x80\x9d for finding the ban unconstitutional).  But the parties in <em>Stenberg</em> did not ask for, and we did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case that is before us, however, we agree with New Hampshire that the lower courts need not have invalidated the law wholesale.  Respondents, too, recognize the possibility of a modest remedy: They pleaded for any relief \xe2\x80\x9cjust and proper,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 13 (Complaint), and conceded at oral argument that carefully crafted injunctive relief may resolve this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, 40.  Only a few applications of New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s parental notification statute would present a constitutional problem.  So long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the statute\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is some dispute as to whether New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s legislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy.  New Hampshire notes that the Act contains a severability clause providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provisions or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7132:28.  Respondents, on the other hand, contend that New Hampshire legislators preferred no statute at all to a statute enjoined in the way we have described.  Because this is an open question, we remand for the lower courts to determine legislative intent in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Either an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invalidating the statute <em>in toto</em> should obviate any concern about the Act\xe2\x80\x99s life exception.  We therefore need not pass on the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 alternative holding.  Finally, if the Act does survive in part on remand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents\xe2\x80\x99 separate objection to the judicial bypass\xe2\x80\x99 confidentiality provision.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Forty-four States, including New Hampshire, have parental involvement (that is, consent or notification) laws.
