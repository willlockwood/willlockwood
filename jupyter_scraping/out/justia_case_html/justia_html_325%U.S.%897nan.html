Practice of the Justices over the years has not been uniform, and the diversity of attitudes to the question doubtless leads to some confusion as to what the bar may expect and as to whether the action in any case is a matter of individual or collective responsibility.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1938511">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation v.

It is always obvious that unless one or more of them is willing to reconsider his position, no good can come of reargument.  Hence, being in dissent, I have no voice as to rehearing, except that I continue to adhere to the dissent.</p>\n<p>Because of these considerations, I concur in denial of the petition.</p>\n<p>MR.
