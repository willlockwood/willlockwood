While using that pass to board a train in Austria operated by petitioner OBB Personenverkehr AG (OBB), the Austrian state-owned railway, Sachs fell to the tracks and suffered traumatic personal injuries.  She sued OBB in Federal District Court.  OBB moved to dismiss, claiming that her suit was barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which shields foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities from suit in United States courts, unless a specified exception applies.  Sachs countered that her suit fell within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s commercial activity exception, which abrogates sovereign immunity for suits \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by [a] foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(2), reasoning that her suit was \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the Massachusetts-based travel agent\xe2\x80\x99s sale of the Eurail pass in the United States, and that the travel agent\xe2\x80\x99s sale of that pass could be attributed to OBB through common law principles of agency.  The District Court held that Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s suit did not fall within \xc2\xa71605(a)(2) and dismissed the suit, but the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court first concluded that the Eurail pass sale by the travel agent could be attributed to OBB through common law principles of agency, and then determined that Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s suit was \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d that Eurail pass sale because the sale established a single element necessary to recover under each cause of action brought by Sachs.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s suit falls outside the commercial activity exception and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity.

There, the Court held that the \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry requires a court to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular conduct on which the action is \xe2\x80\x98based,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 356, and identified that conduct by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98gravamen of the complaint,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 357.

The court concluded that The Rail Pass Experts had acted as OBB\xe2\x80\x99s agent and, using common law principles of agency, attributed that Eurail pass sale to OBB.  <i>Id.,</i> at 591\xe2\x80\x93598.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court next asked whether Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the sale of the Eurail pass within the meaning of \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  The \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d determination, the court explained, requires that the commercial activity within the United States be \xe2\x80\x9cconnected with the conduct that gives rise to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>.<i>,</i> at 590.  But, the court continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not necessary that the entire claim be based upon the commercial activity of OBB.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 599.  Rather, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, Sachs would satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d requirement for a particular claim \xe2\x80\x9cif <i>an element</i> of [that] claim consists in conduct that occurred in commercial activity carried on in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying California law, see <i>id.</i>, at 600, n.\xc2\xa014, the court analyzed Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s causes of action individually and concluded that the sale of the Eurail pass established a necessary element of each of her claims.  Turning first to the negligence claim, the court found that Sachs was required to show that OBB owed her a duty of care as a passenger as one element of that claim.  The court concluded that such a duty arose from the sale of the Eurail pass.  <i>Id.</i>, at 600\xe2\x80\x93602.  Turning next to the other claims, the court determined that the existence of a \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction between a seller and a consumer\xe2\x80\x9d was a necessary element of Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s strict liability and breach of implied warranty claims.  <i>Id.,</i> at 602.  The sale of the Eurail pass, the court noted, provided proof of such a transaction.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Having found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sale of the Eurail pass in the United States forms an essential element of each of Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s claims,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that each claim was \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d by OBB.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari.  574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">OBB contends that the sale of the Eurail pass is not attributable to the railway, reasoning that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not allow attribution through principles found in the common law of agency.

In <i>Nelson</i>, a husband and wife brought suit against Saudi Arabia and its state-owned hospital, seeking damages for intentional and negligent torts stemming from the husband\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly wrongful arrest, imprisonment, and torture by Saudi police while he was employed at a hospital in Saudi Arabia.  <i>Id.</i>, at 351, 353\xe2\x80\x93354.  The Saudi defendants claimed sovereign immunity under the Act, arguing, <i>inter alia</i>, that \xc2\xa71605(a)(2) was inapplicable because the suit was \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d sovereign acts\xe2\x80\x94the exercise of Saudi police authority\xe2\x80\x94and not upon commercial activity.

The Nelsons countered that their suit was \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 commercial activities in \xe2\x80\x9crecruit[ing] Scott Nelson for work at the hospital, sign[ing] an employment contract with him, and subsequently employ[ing] him.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358.

Considering dictionary definitions and lower court decisions, we explained that a court should identify that \xe2\x80\x9cparticular conduct\xe2\x80\x9d by looking to the \xe2\x80\x9cbasis\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation\xe2\x80\x9d for a claim, <i>id.,</i> at 357 (citing dictionary definitions), \xe2\x80\x9cthose elements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that, if proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98gravamen of the complaint,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Callejo</i> v. <i>Bancomer, S.\xc2\xa0A.</i>, 764 F.\xc2\xa02d 1101, 1109 (CA5 1985)).  Under that analysis, we found that the commercial activities, while they \xe2\x80\x9cled to the conduct that eventually injured the Nelsons,\xe2\x80\x9d were not the particular conduct upon which their suit was based.  The suit was instead based upon the Saudi sovereign acts that actually injured them.  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358.  The Nelsons\xe2\x80\x99 suit therefore did not fit within \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  <i>Id.</i>, at 361\xe2\x80\x93362.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit held that Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the sale of the Eurail pass because the sale of the pass provided \xe2\x80\x9c<i>an element</i>\xe2\x80\x9d of each of her claims.  737 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 599.  Under <i>Nelson</i>, however, the mere fact that the sale of the Eurail pass would establish a single element of a claim is insufficient to demonstrate that the claim is \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d that sale for purposes of \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit apparently derived its one-element test from an overreading of one part of one sentence in <i>Nelson</i>, in which we observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase [\xe2\x80\x98based upon\xe2\x80\x99] is read most naturally to mean those elements of a claim that, if proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357.  We do not see how that mention of elements\xe2\x80\x94plural\xe2\x80\x94could be considered an endorsement of a <i>one</i>-element test, nor how the particular element the Ninth Circuit singled out for each of Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s claims could be construed to entitle her to relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Be that as it may, our analysis in <i>Nelson</i> is flatly incompatible with a one-element approach.  A one-element test necessarily requires a court to identify <i>all</i> the elementsof each claim in a complaint before that court may re-ject those claims for falling outside \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  But we did not undertake such an exhaustive claim-by-claim, element-by-element analysis of the Nelsons\xe2\x80\x99 16 causes of action, nor did we engage in the choice-of-law analysis that would have been a necessary prelude to such an undertaking.  Compare <i>id.</i>, at 356\xe2\x80\x93358, with 737 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 600, n.\xc2\xa014 (noting disagreement over whether state or federal common law principles govern suits under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Nelson</i> instead teaches that an action is \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular conduct\xe2\x80\x9d that constitutes the \xe2\x80\x9cgravamen\xe2\x80\x9d of the suit.  Rather than individually analyzing each of the Nelsons\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action, we zeroed in on the core of their suit: the Saudi sovereign acts that actually injured them.  As the Court explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cEven taking each of the Nelsons\xe2\x80\x99 allegations about Scott Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s recruitment and employment as true, those facts alone entitle the Nelsons to nothing under their theory of the case.  The Nelsons have .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. alleged .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. personal injuries caused by [the defendants\xe2\x80\x99] intentional wrongs and by [the defendants\xe2\x80\x99] negligent failure to warn Scott Nelson that they might commit those wrongs.  Those torts, and not the arguably commercial activities that preceded their commission, form the basis for the Nelsons\xe2\x80\x99 suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 358.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under this analysis, the conduct constituting the gravamen of Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s suit plainly occurred abroad.  All of her claims turn on the same tragic episode in Austria, alleg-edly caused by wrongful conduct and dangerous conditions in Austria, which led to injuries suffered in Austria.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sachs maintains that some of those claims are not limited to negligent conduct or unsafe conditions in Austria, but rather involve at least some wrongful action in the United States.  Her strict liability claim for failure to warn, for example, alleges that OBB should have alerted her to the dangerous conditions at the Innsbruck train station when OBB sold the Eurail pass to her <i>in the United States</i>.  Under any theory of the case that Sachs pre-sents, however, there is nothing wrongful about the sale of the Eurail pass standing alone.  Without the existence of the unsafe boarding conditions in Innsbruck, there would have been nothing to warn Sachs about when she bought the Eurail pass.  However Sachs frames her suit, the incident in Innsbruck remains at its foundation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As we explained in <i>Nelson</i>, any other approach would allow plaintiffs to evade the Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions through artful pleading.  For example, any plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9ccould recast virtually any claim of intentional tort .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a claim of failure to warn, simply by charging the defendant with an obligation to announce its own tortious propensity before indulging it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 363.  To allow such \xe2\x80\x9crecast[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d of a complaint, we reasoned, would \xe2\x80\x9cgive jurisdictional significance to [a] feint of language,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively thwart[ing] the Act\xe2\x80\x99s manifest purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A century ago, in a letter to then-Professor Frankfurter, Justice Holmes wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9cessentials\xe2\x80\x9d of a personal injury narrative will be found at the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint of contact\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe place where the boy got his fingers pinched.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter (Dec. 19, 1915), in Holmes and Frankfurter: Their Correspondence, 1912\xe2\x80\x931934, p. 40 (R. Mennel &amp; C. Compston eds. 1996).  At least in this case, that insight holds true.  Regardless of whether Sachs seeks relief under claims for negligence, strict liability for failure to warn, or breach of implied warranty, the \xe2\x80\x9cessentials\xe2\x80\x9d of her suit for purposes of \xc2\xa71605(a)(2) are found in Austria.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Sachs raises a new argument in this Court in an attempt to fit her claims within \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  In addition to arguing that her claims are \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the sale of the Eurail pass, she now contends that her suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOBB\xe2\x80\x99s overall commercial railway enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 24; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ommercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa71605(a)(2), is defined to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial activity carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71603(e).  Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s new theory is that OBB\xe2\x80\x99s <i>entire</i> railway enterprise constitutes the \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial activity\xe2\x80\x9d that has the requisite \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial contact with the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d because OBB reaches out to American customers by marketing and selling Eurail passes in the United States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That argument was never presented to any lower court and is therefore forfeited.  Sachs argued in the courts below only that her claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the sale of the Eurail pass, and the lower courts resolved the case on that understanding.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>737 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 591, n.\xc2\xa04 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district court concluded, based on the agreement of the parties, that \xe2\x80\x98the only relevant commercial activity within the United States was plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s March 2007 purchase of a Eurail Pass from the Rail Pass Experts.\xe2\x80\x99  We consider only the relevant conduct as defined by the district court.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Indeed, when we granted certiorari, the relevant question presented for our review was whether Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9csale of the ticket in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i; accord, Brief for Respondent i.
