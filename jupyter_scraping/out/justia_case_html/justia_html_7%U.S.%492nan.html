The defendants pleaded the general issue, and at the trial a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a demurrer to evidence, which stated in substance that the defendants signed and delivered the said note to McPherson -- that he applied to the agent of the plaintiff for the corn, and offered three dollars a barrel, payable in twelve months -- that the agent consulted the plaintiff, who agreed that McPherson should have the corn on those terms, if he would give security -- that McPherson then offered as his security, Lawrason &amp; Smoot.  The agent agreed to take them if they would give their assumption in writing.  In a few days afterwards, McPherson sent to the agent the said note of Lawrason &amp; Smoot.  Before the corn was delivered, the agent informed the plaintiff what had passed between himself and McPherson relative to the corn, and also showed him the note and asked him whether it would do, to which he replied he supposed it would.  But they called upon Lawrason and asked him if he was content to be McPherson\'s security for this corn.

S. 495</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>This action is grounded upon a note in writing which was certainly intended by the defendants to give a credit to McPherson.  They are bound by every principle of moral rectitude and good faith to fulfill those expectations which they thus raised, and which induced the plaintiff to part with his property.  The evidence was clear that the credit was given upon the faith of the letter.</p>\n<p>Unless, therefore, there is some plain and positive rule of law against it, the action ought to be supported.</p>\n<p>In the case cited from Espinasse, the rule is laid down too broadly.  If compared with analogous cases, it will be found to be considerably modified.</p>\n<p>Thus, if money be delivered by A. to B. to be paid over to C., although no promise is made by B. to C., yet C. may recover the money from B. by an action of assumpsit.</p>\n<p>If it be said that in such a case the law raises the assumpsit from the facts, and if the facts do not imply </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 7 U. S. 496</a></p><p> an assumpsit, no action will lay, it may be answered that in the present case there is an actual assumpsit to all the world, and any person who trusts in consequence of that promise has a right of action.</p>\n<p>It has been suggested by the counsel for the defendants that, although an action of assumpsit will not lie, yet possibly the plaintiff might support an action for the deceit.  But an action for the deceit must be grounded upon the breach of the promise.  And if an action will lie in any form, the present seems to be at least as proper as any other.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
