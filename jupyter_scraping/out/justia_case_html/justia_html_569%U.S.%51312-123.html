One such order, the California Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a particular year\xe2\x80\x99s production should be included in the pool.

When they refused to surrender the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceedings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to retain raisins in reserve and pay assessments.  Petitioners countered that as producers, they were not subject to the Order.  They also raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against taking property without just compensation.  An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order, and rejected their takings defense.  On appeal, a judicial officer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to address the takings claim.  Petitioners sought review in the Federal District Court.  Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found that substantial evidence supported the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination that petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It agreed that petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims.  It recognized that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAA\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive remedial scheme, see \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608c(15), but found that petitioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim.

Petitioners argued that they were producers\xe2\x80\x94and thus not subject to the AMAA or the Marketing Order\xe2\x80\x94but both the USDA and the District Court concluded that they were handlers.  And the fines and civil penalties for failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity.  Because the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers, their takings claim raised as a defense against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity.  In finding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit confused petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 statutory argument that they were producers with their constitutional argument that, assuming they were handlers, their fine violated the \n \nFifth Amendment.  The relevant question is whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order.

Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 172\n, is misplaced.  There, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a zoning decision effected a taking without just compensation was not ripe.  But the claim failed because the plaintiff could not show that it had been injured by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s action when there had been no final decision.  Here, petitioners were subject to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties.  The takings claim in Williamson County was also not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation through the procedures [provided by] the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 194.  The Government argues that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim is premature because the Tucker Act affords a remedy, but, in fact, the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handler\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim.  As a result, there is no alternative remedy.

The provision\xe2\x80\x99s text does not bar handlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement action.  Allowing handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges to marketing orders under \xc2\xa7608c(15)(A), for a handler who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitutional challenge fails.  It would also make little sense to force a party to pay an assessed fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.

The AMAA and the Marketing Order were adopted to stabilize prices by limiting the supply of raisins on the market.  Petitioners are California raisin growers who believe that this regulatory scheme violates the \n \nFifth Amendment.  After petitioners refused to surrender the requisite portion of their raisins, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative pro-ceedings against petitioners that led to the imposition of more than $650,000 in fines and civil penalties.  Petitioners sought judicial review, claiming that the monetary sanctions were an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation.  The Ninth Circuit held that petitioners were required to bring their takings claim in the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to review petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  We disagree.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim, raised as an affirmative defense to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement action, was properly before the court because the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over takings claims brought by raisin handlers.

See \xc2\xa7989.26.  The Marketing Order authorizes the RAC to recommend setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market.  See \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608c(6)(E); 7 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7989.54(d) and 989.65.  Each year, the RAC reviews crop yield, inventories, and shipments and makes recommendations to the Secretary whether or not there should be a reserve pool. \xc2\xa7989.54.  If the RAC recommends a reserve pool, it also recommends what portion of that year\xe2\x80\x99s production should be included in the pool (\xe2\x80\x9creserve-tonnage\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rest of that year\xe2\x80\x99s production remains available for sale on the open market (\xe2\x80\x9cfree-tonnage\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7989.54(d), (a).  The Secretary approves the recommendation if he determines that the recommen-dation would \xe2\x80\x9ceffectuate the declared policy of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7989.55.  The reserve-tonnage, calculated as a percentage of a producer\xe2\x80\x99s crop, varies from year to year.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the Marketing Order\xe2\x80\x99s reserve requirements, a producer is only paid for the free-tonnage raisins.  \xc2\xa7989.65.  The reserve-tonnage raisins, on the other hand, must be held by the handler in segregated bins \xe2\x80\x9cfor the account\xe2\x80\x9d of the RAC.  \xc2\xa7989.66(f\xc2\xa0).  The RAC may then sell the reserve-tonnage raisins to handlers for resale in overseas markets, or may alternatively direct that they be sold or given at no cost to secondary, noncompetitive domestic markets, such as school lunch programs.  \xc2\xa7989.67(b).  The reserve pool sales proceeds are used to finance the RAC\xe2\x80\x99s administrative costs.  \xc2\xa7989.53(a).

The Hornes do business as Raisin Valley Farms, a general partnership.  For more than 30 years, the Hornes operated only as raisin producers.  But, af- ter becoming disillusioned with the AMAA regulatory scheme,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t they began looking for ways to avoid the mandatory reserve program.  Since the AMAA applies only to handlers, the Hornes devised a plan to bring their raisins to market without going through a traditional handler.  To this end, the Hornes entered into a partnership with Mrs. Horne\xe2\x80\x99s parents called Lassen Vineyards.  In addition to its grape-growing activities, Lassen Vineyards purchased equipment to clean, stem, sort, and package the raisins from Raisin Valley Farms and Lassen Vineyards.  It also contracted with more than 60 other raisin growers to clean, stem, sort, and, in some cases, box and stack their raisins for a fee.  The Hornes\xe2\x80\x99 facilities processed more than 3 million pounds of raisins in\xc2\xa0toto during the 2002\xe2\x80\x932003 and 2003\xe2\x80\x932004 crop years.

Nor did they set aside reserve-tonnage raisins from those produced and owned by the more than 60 other farmers who contracted with Lassen Vineyards for packing services.  They also declined to arrange for RAC inspection of  the rai- sins they received for processing, denied the RAC access to their records, and held none of their own raisins in reserve.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn April 1, 2004, the Administrator of the Agriculture Marketing Service (Administrator) initiated an enforcement action against the Hornes, Raisin Valley Farms, and Lassen Vineyards (petitioners).

It also alleged that petitioners violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order by submitting inaccurate forms to the RAC and failing to hold inspections of incoming raisins, retain raisins in reserve, pay assessments, and allow access to their records.  Petitioners denied the allegations, countering that they were not \xe2\x80\x9chandlers\xe2\x80\x9d and asserting that they did not acquire physical possession of the other producers\xe2\x80\x99 raisins within the meaning of the regulations.

The court did not resolve petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim, however, because it concluded that that it lacked jurisdiction to do so.  The court explained that \xe2\x80\x9ca takings claim against the federal government must be brought [in the Court of Federal Claims] in the first instance, \xe2\x80\x98unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1079 (quoting Eastern Enterprises v.

The court recognized that \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608c(15) provides an administrative remedy to handlers wishing to challenge marketing orders under the AMAA, and it agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a handler, or a producer-handler in its capacity as a handler, challenges a marketing order on takings grounds, Court of Federal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to section [60]8c(15)\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive procedural scheme and administrative exhaustion requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  673 F. 3d, at 1079.  But, the Ninth Circuit determined, petitioners brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers, not handlers.  Id., at 1080.  Consequently, the court was of the view that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the AMAA precludes the Hornes from alleging in the Court of Federal Claims that the reserve program injures them in their capacity as producers by subjecting them to a taking requiring compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

This determination is not correct. Although petitioners argued that they were producers\xe2\x80\x94and thus not subject to the AMAA or Marketing Order at all\xe2\x80\x94both the USDA and the District Court concluded that petitioners were \xe2\x80\x9chandlers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the civil penalty, assessment, and reimbursement for fail-ure to reserve raisins were all levied on petitioners in their capacity as \xe2\x80\x9chandlers.\xe2\x80\x9d  If petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they were producers had prevailed, they would not have been subject to any of the monetary sanctions imposed on them.  See \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608c(13)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo order issued under this chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his capacity as a producer\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is undisputed that the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers.  As a result, any defense raised against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity.  Petitioners ar-gue that it would be unconstitutional for the Government to come on their land and confiscate raisins, or to con-fiscate the proceeds of raisin sales, without paying just com-pensation; and, that it is therefore unconstitutional to fine petitioners for not complying with the unconstitutional requirement.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Brief for Petitioners 54.  Given that fines can only be levied on handlers, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim makes sense only as a defense to penalties imposed upon them in their capacity as handlers.  The Ninth Circuit confused petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 statutory argument (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cwe are producers, not handlers\xe2\x80\x9d) with their constitutional argument (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cassuming we are handlers, fining us for refusing to turn over reserve-tonnage raisins violates the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe relevant question, then, is whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings-based defense was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds.

According to the Government, be-cause a takings claim can be pursued later in the Court of Federal Claims, the Ninth Circuit correctly refused to adjudicate petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings defense.  In support of its position, the Government relies largely on Williamson County Regional Planning Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, \n\n473 U. S. 172 (1985)\n.  Brief for Respondent 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (\xe2\x80\x9cJust compensation need not \xe2\x80\x98be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is re-quired is that a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation\xe2\x80\x99 exist at the time of the taking\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Williamson County, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 194)).  In that case, the plaintiff filed suit against the Regional Planning Commission, claiming that a zoning decision by the Commission effected a taking of property without just compensation.  Id., at 182.  We found that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cripe\xe2\x80\x9d for two reasons, neither of which supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, we explained that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim in Williamson County failed because the plaintiff could not show that it had been injured by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s action.  Specifically, the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 186.  Here, by contrast, petitioners were subject to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties at the time they sought judicial review under \xc2\xa7608c(14)(B).  This was clearly sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d for federal jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Williamson County plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim was not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation through the procedures the State ha[d] provided for doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 194.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the government has provided an adequate process for obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process yields just compensation, then the property owner has no claim against the Government for a taking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 194\xe2\x80\x93195 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Stated differently, a \n \nFifth Amendment claim is premature until it is clear that the Government has both taken property and denied just compensation.

We disagree with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, however, because the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handler\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim.  As a result, there is no alternative \xe2\x80\x9creasonable, certain, and adequate\xe2\x80\x9d remedial scheme through which petitioners (as handlers) must proceed before obtaining review of their claim under the AMAA.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over Tucker Act claims \xe2\x80\x9cfounded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive de-partment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71491(a)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] claim for just compensation under the Takings Clause must be brought to the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance, unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Eastern Enterprises, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 520 (plurality opinion); see also United States v.

Pursuant to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7608c(15) (A)\xe2\x80\x93(B), a handler may file with the Secretary a direct challenge to a marketing order and its applicability to  him.  We have held that \xe2\x80\x9cany handler\xe2\x80\x9d subject to a mar-keting order must raise any challenges to the order, including constitutional challenges, in administrative proceedings.  See United States v. Ruzicka, \n\n329 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287, \n294 (1946)\n.

These statutory provisions afford handlers a ready avenue to bring takings claim against the USDA.  We thus conclude that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 takings claim.  Petitioners (as handlers) have no alternative remedy, and their takings claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cpremature\xe2\x80\x9d when presented to the Ninth Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cpremature\xe2\x80\x9d for Tucker Act purposes, the question remains whether a takings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the USDA under \xc2\xa7608c(14).  We hold that it may.  The  AMAA provides that the handler may not be subjected to an adverse order until he has been given \xe2\x80\x9cnotice and an opportunity for an agency hearing on the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7608c(14)(B).  The text of \xc2\xa7608c(14)(B) does not bar handlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement action.  Allowing handlers to raise constitutional challenges in the course of enforcement proceedings would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges to marketing orders under \xc2\xa7608c(15)(A) because a handler who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if his constitutional challenge fails.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the case of an administrative enforcement proceeding, when a party raises a constitutional defense to an assessed fine, it would make little sense to require the party to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.  See Eastern Enterprises, supra, at 520.  We see no indication that Congress intended this result for handlers subject to enforcement proceedings under the AMAA.  Petitioners were therefore free to raise their takings-based defense before the USDA.  And, because \xc2\xa7608c(14)(B) allows a handler to seek judicial review of an adverse order, the district court and Ninth Circuit were not precluded from reviewing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional challenge.  The grant of jurisdiction necessarily includes the power to review any constitutional challenges properly presented to and rejected by the agency.

The USDA argued that they had no standing to file the petition because they had not admitted that they were handlers. The judicial officer granted the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.  Petitioners filed a complaint in District Court, but the court dismissed it as untimely.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  See Horne v. Dept. of Agriculture, 395 Fed. Appx. 486 (2010).\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
