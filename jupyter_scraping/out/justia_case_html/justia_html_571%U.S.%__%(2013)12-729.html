(Hartford) is the administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (Wal-Mart) Group Long Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The Plan\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant to the judicial review provision in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after \xe2\x80\x9cproof of loss\xe2\x80\x9d is due.  Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford.  After petitioner exhausted the mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial.  Almost three years after that final denial but more than three years after proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pursuant to ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was untimely.  The District Court granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent.  The Second Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Plan\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision is enforceable.

A plan participant\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action under ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until the plan issues a final denial.  But it does not follow that a plan and its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period before that time.

Wolfe, \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586\n, provides that a contractual limitations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary.  That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability of the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision.  The Wolfe approach necessarily allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and to its commencement.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0The principle that contractual limitations provisions should ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the context of an ERISA plan.  Heimeshoff\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action is bound up with the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to bring suit \xe2\x80\x9cto enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  This Court has thus recognized the particular importance of enforcing plan terms as written in \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) claims,  see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and will not presume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different approach here.

Applicable regulations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about one year.  Here, the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrative review process (\xe2\x80\x9cinternal review\xe2\x80\x9d) required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with approximately one year to file suit.  Her reliance on Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, \n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 355\n, in which this Court declined to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII employment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavailing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to bringing a timely ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) claim.

The record for judicial review generally has been limited to the administrative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during internal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.  In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such determinations only for abuse of discretion.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(ii)\xc2\xa0It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will endanger judicial review.  To the extent that administrators attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant.  Evidence from forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual provision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review will not diminish the availability of judicial review either.  Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3-year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights.  More- over, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as waiver or estoppel, see, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n\n136 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287\n\xe2\x80\x93299, and equitable tolling, see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89\n, that nevertheless may allow participants to proceed.  Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolution beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time.  29 CFR \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(c)(3)(ii).  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(3)\xc2\xa0Heimeshoff\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments are unpersuasive.  The limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during internal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the limitations provision, which is enforceable.  And federal courts need not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not borrowed from state law.

S. C. \xc2\xa71001 et seq., may bring a civil action under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) to re- cover benefits due under the terms of the plan.  \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  Courts have generally required participants to exhaust the plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrative remedies before filing suit to recover benefits.  ERISA does not, however, specify a statute of limitations for filing suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Filling that gap, the plan at issue here requires participants to bring suit within three years after \xe2\x80\x9cproof of loss\xe2\x80\x9d is due.  Because proof of loss is due before a plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrative process can be completed, the ad- ministrative exhaustion requirement will, in practice, shorten the contractual limitations period.  The question presented is whether the contractual limitations provision is enforceable.  We hold that it is.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2005, petitioner Julie Heimeshoff began to report chronic pain and fatigue that interfered with her duties as a senior public relations manager for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Her claim form, supported by a statement from her rheumatologist, listed her symptoms as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extreme fatigue, significant pain, and difficulty in concentration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7.  In November 2005, Hartford notified Heimeshoff that it could not determine whether she was disabled because her rheumatologist had never responded to Hartford\xe2\x80\x99s request for additional information.  Hartford denied the claim the following month for failure to provide satisfactory proof of loss.  Hartford instructed Heimeshoff that it would con- sider an appeal filed within 180 days, but later informed her that it would reopen her claim, without the need for an appeal, if her rheumatologist provided the requested information.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn July 2006, another physician evaluated Heimeshoff and concluded that she was disabled.  Heimeshoff sub- mitted that evaluation and additional medical evidence in October 2006.  Hartford then retained a physician to review Heimeshoff\xe2\x80\x99s records and speak with her rheumatologist.  That physician issued a report in November 2006 concluding that Heimeshoff was able to perform the activities required by her sedentary occupation.  Hartford denied Heimeshoff\xe2\x80\x99s claim later that November.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn May 2007, Heimeshoff requested an extension of the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s appeal deadline until September 30, 2007, in order to provide additional evidence.  Hartford granted the extension.  On September 26, 2007, Heimeshoff submitted her appeal along with additional cardiopulmonary and neuropsychological evaluations.  After two additional physicians retained by Hartford reviewed the claim, Hartford issued its final denial on November 26, 2007.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn November 18, 2010, almost three years later (but more than three years after proof of loss was due), Heimeshoff filed suit in District Court seeking review of her denied claim pursuant to ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that Heimeshoff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was barred by the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision, which stated: \xe2\x80\x9cLegal action cannot be taken against The Hartford .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Recognizing that ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations for actions under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), the court explained that the limitations period provided by the most nearly analogous state statute applies.  See North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29\n\xe2\x80\x9334 (1995).

Because proof of loss is due before a participant can exhaust internal review, Heimeshoff contends that this limitations provision runs afoul of the general rule that statutes of limitations commence upon accrual of the cause of action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons that follow, we reject that argument.  Absent a controlling statute to the contrary, a participant and a plan may agree by contract to a particular limitations period, even one that starts to run before the cause of action accrues, as long as the period is reasonable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRecognizing that Congress generally sets statutory limitations periods to begin when their associated causes of action accrue, this Court has often construed statutes of limitations to commence when the plaintiff is permitted to file suit.  See, e.g., Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409, \n418 (2005)\n (resolving an ambiguity in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Bay Area Laundry, supra, at 201)); Rawlings v. Ray, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 96, \n98 (1941)\n.  At the same time, we have recognized that statutes of limitations do not inexorably commence upon accrual.  See Reiter v. Cooper, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258, \n267 (1993)\n (noting the possibility that a cause of action may \xe2\x80\x9caccru[e] at one time for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run, but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Dodd v.

For that reason, we find more appropriate guidance in precedent confronting whether to enforce the terms of a contractual limitations provision.  Those cases provide a well-established framework suitable for resolving the ques- tion in this case:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the absence of a controlling statute to the con-trary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, between the parties, the time for bringing an action on such contract to a period less than that prescribed in the general statute of limitations, provided that the shorter period itself shall be a reasonable period.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Wolfe, \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586, \n608 (1947)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tWe have recognized that some statutes of limitations do not permit parties to choose a shorter period by contract.  See, e.g., Louisiana &amp; Western R. Co. v. Gardiner, \n\n273 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280, \n284 (1927)\n (contractual provision requiring suit against common carrier within two years and one day after delivery was invalid under a federal statute \xe2\x80\x9cdeclar[ing] unlawful any limitation shorter than two years from the time notice is given of the disallowance of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rule set forth in Wolfe recognizes, however, that other statutes of limitations provide only a default rule that permits parties to choose a shorter limitations period.  See Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Ins. Co., 7 Wall. 386, 390 (1869) (finding \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in th[e] language or object [of statutes of limitations] which inhibits parties from stipulating for a shorter period within which to assert their respective claims\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n\n227 U.\xc2\xa0S. 657\n\xe2\x80\x93673 (1913) (citing examples).  If parties are permitted to contract around a default statute of limitations, it follows that the same rule applies where the statute creating the cause of action is silent regarding a limitations period.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Wolfe rule necessarily allows parties to agree not only to the length of a limitations period but also to its commencement.  The duration of a limitations period can be measured only by reference to its start date.  Each is therefore an integral part of the limitations provision, and there is no basis for categorically preventing parties from agreeing on one aspect but not the other.  See Electrical Workers v.

They contend that participants will shortchange their own rights during that process in order to have more time in which to seek judicial review.  Their premise\xe2\x80\x94that participants will sacrifice the benefits of internal review to preserve additional time for filing suit\xe2\x80\x94is highly dubious in light of the consequences of that course of action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, to the extent participants fail to develop evidence during internal review, they risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.  The Courts of Appeals have generally limited the record for judicial review to the administrative record compiled during internal review.  See, e.g., Foster v. PPG Industries, Inc., 693 F.\xc2\xa03d 1226, 1231 (CA10 2012); Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 121 (CA3 2012); McCartha v. National City Corp., 419 F.\xc2\xa03d 437, 441 (CA6 2005).  Second, participants are not likely to value judicial review of plan determinations over internal review.  Many plans (including this Plan) vest discretion over benefits determinations in plan administrators.  See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101\n\xe2\x80\x93112 (1989) (permitting the vesting of discretion); see also App. in No. 12\xe2\x80\x93651\xe2\x80\x93cv (CA2), p. 34.  Courts ordinarily review determinations by such plans only for abuse of discretion.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 105\n\xe2\x80\x93116 (2008).  In short, participants have much to lose and little to gain by giving up the full measure of internal review in favor of marginal extra time to seek judicial review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHeimeshoff and the United States next warn that it will endanger judicial review to allow plans to set limitations periods that begin to run before internal review is complete.  The United States suggests that administrators may attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19; see also White, 488 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 247\xe2\x80\x93248.  But administrators are required by the regulations governing the internal review process to take prompt action, see supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and the penalty for failure to meet those deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant.  29 CFR \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(l).  In addition, that sort of dilatory behavior may implicate one of the traditional defenses to a statute of limitations.  See infra, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States suggests that even good-faith administration of internal review will significantly diminish the availability of judicial review if this limitations provision is enforced.  Forty years of ERISA administration sug- gest otherwise.  The limitations provision at issue is quite common; the vast majority of States require certain insurance policies to include 3-year limitations periods that run from the date proof of loss is due.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But there is no significant evidence that limitations provisions like the one here have similarly thwarted judicial review.  As explained above, see supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, ERISA regulations structure internal review to proceed in an expeditious manner.  It stands to reason that the cases in which internal review leaves participants with less than one year to file suit are rare.  Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs are actually time barred as a result of this 3-year limitations provision.  See Abena v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 544 F.\xc2\xa03d 880 (CA7 2008); Touqan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 2012 WL 3465493 (ED Mich., Aug. 14, 2012); Smith v. Unum Provident, 2012 WL 1436458 (WD Ky., Apr. 24, 2012); Fry v. Hartford Ins. Co., 2011 WL 1672474 (WDNY, May 3, 2011); Rotondi v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Group, 2010 WL 3720830 (SDNY, Sept. 22, 2010).  Those cases suggest that this barrier falls on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights.  See Abena, supra, at 884 (by his own admission, there was \xe2\x80\x9cno reason\xe2\x80\x9d plaintiff could not have filed suit during the remaining seven months of limitations period); Smith, supra, at *2 (plaintiff filed suit four years after the limitations period expired, and six years after final de- nial); Rotondi, supra, at *8 (\xe2\x80\x9cApplication of the .\xc2\xa0. . limitations period works no unfairness here\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Rice, 578 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 457 (the participant \xe2\x80\x9chas not established that he has been diligently pursuing his rights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas given no reason for his late filing\xe2\x80\x9d); Burke, 572 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 81 (following exhaustion, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo years and five months of the limitations period remained\xe2\x80\x9d); Salerno v.

The evidence that this 3-year limitations provision harms diligent participants is far too insubstantial to set aside the plain terms of the contract.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Moreover, even in the rare cases where internal review prevents participants from bringing \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) actions within the contractual period, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines that may nevertheless allow participants to proceed.  If the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s conduct causes a participant to miss the deadline for judicial review, waiver or estoppel may prevent the administrator from invoking the limitations provision as a defense.  See, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n\n136 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287\n\xe2\x80\x93299 (1890); LaMantia v. Voluntary Plan Adm\xe2\x80\x99rs, Inc., 401 F.\xc2\xa03d 1114, 1119 (CA9 2005).  To the extent the participant has diligently pursued both internal review and judicial review but was prevented from filing suit by extraordinary circumstances, equitable tolling may apply.  Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89, \n95 (1990)\n (limitations defenses \xe2\x80\x9cin lawsuits between private litigants are customarily subject to \xe2\x80\x98equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Finally, in addition to those traditional remedies, plans that offer appeals or dispute resolution beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time.  29 CFR \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(c)(3)(ii).  Thus, we are not persuaded that the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision is inconsistent with ERISA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo additional arguments warrant mention.  First, Heimeshoff argues\xe2\x80\x94for the first time in this litigation\xe2\x80\x94that the limitations period should be tolled as a matter of course during internal review.  By effectively delaying the commencement of the limitations period until the conclusion of internal review, however, this approach reconstitutes the contractual revision we declined to make.  As we explained, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement should be enforced unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or foreclosed by ERISA.  The limitations period here is neither.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 11\xe2\x80\x9314, and this page.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do the ERISA regulations require tolling during internal review.  A plan must agree to toll the limitations provision only in one particular circumstance: when a plan offers voluntary internal appeals beyond what is permitted by regulation.  \xc2\xa72560.503\xe2\x80\x931(c)(3)(ii).  Even then, the limitations period is tolled only during that specific portion of internal review.  This limited tolling requirement would be superfluous if the regulations contemplated tolling throughout the process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, relying on our decision in Hardin v. Straub, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536 (1989)\n, Heimeshoff contends that we must inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period throughout the exhaustion process.  In Hardin, we interpreted \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 to borrow a State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory limitations period.  We recognized that when a federal statute is deemed to borrow a State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period, the State\xe2\x80\x99s tolling rules are ordinarily borrowed as well because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n virtually all statutes of limitations the chronological length of the limitation period is interrelated with provisions regarding tolling . . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 539 (quoting Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., \n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 454, \n464 (1975)\n); see also Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, \n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478, \n484 (1980)\n (in \xc2\xa71983 actions \xe2\x80\x9ca state statute of limitations and the coordinate tolling rules\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cbinding rules of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here, unlike in Hardin, the parties have adopted a limitations period by contract.  Under these circumstances, where there is no need to borrow a state statute of limitations there is no need to borrow concomitant state tolling rules.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe hold that the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision is enforceable.
