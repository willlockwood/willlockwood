V. CITY OF VALDEZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">POLAR TANKERS, INC. <em>v</em>. CITY OF VALDEZ, ALASKA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of alaska</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93310.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 1, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 15, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">A Valdez, Alaska, ordinance that imposes a personal property tax on certain boats and vessels contains exceptions which, in effect, largely limit its applicability to large oil tankers.  Petitioner Polar Tankers, Inc., whose vessels transport crude oil from the Port of Valdez to refineries in other States, challenged the ordinance in state court, claiming (1) that the tax was unconstitutional under Art. I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 3, which forbids a \xe2\x80\x9cState \xe2\x80\xa6 without the Consent of Congress, [to] lay any Duty of Tonnage,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) that the tax\xe2\x80\x99s value-allocation method violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses.  The court rejected the Tonnage Clause claim, but accepted the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim.  On appeal, the State Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding that because it was a value-based property tax, the tax was not a duty of tonnage.  The State Supreme Court also held the allocation method was fair and thus valid under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">182 P.\xc2\xa03d 614, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II\xe2\x80\x93A, and II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931, concluding that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax violates the Tonnage Clause.  Consequently, Polar Tankers\xe2\x80\x99 alternative Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause arguments need not be considered.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has consistently interpreted the language of the Tonnage Clause in light of its purpose, which mirrors the intent of other constitutional provisions that seek to restrain the States from exercising the taxing power in a way that is injurious to the interests of other States.  The Clause seeks to prevent States from nullifying Art. I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 2\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against import and export duties by taxing \xe2\x80\x9cthe vessels transporting the merchandise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/261/index.html">296 U. S. 261</a>, 265.  It also reflects an effort to diminish a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain tax advantages based on its favorable geographic position.  Because the Clause forbids a State to \xe2\x80\x9cdo that indirectly which she is forbidden \xe2\x80\xa6 to do directly,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Passenger Cases</em>, 7 How. 283, 458, the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Clyde Mallory Lines, supra</em>, at 265\xe2\x80\x93266.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause forbids.  The ordinance seems designed to impose \xe2\x80\x9ca charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tax applies almost exclusively to oil tankers, but to no other form of personal property.  An oil tanker can be subject to the tax based on a single entry into the port.  Moreover, the tax is closely correlated with cargo capacity.  Contrary to Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the fact that the tax is designed to raise revenue for general municipal services argues for, not against, application of the Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Ginsburg, rejected, in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s claim that, under <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, 12 Wall. 204, its tax is \xe2\x80\x9cnot within the prohibition of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d because it is \xe2\x80\x9clevied \xe2\x80\xa6 upon ships \xe2\x80\xa6 as property, based on a valuation of the same as property,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 213 (emphasis deleted).  This Court later made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition\xe2\x80\x9d against tonnage duties \xe2\x80\x9ccomes into play\xe2\x80\x9d where vessels \xe2\x80\x9care not taxed in the <em>same manner </em>as the other property of the citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Transportation Co.</em> v. <em>Wheeling</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/273/index.html">99 U. S. 273</a>, 284.  This qualification, important in light of the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, means that, in order to fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon other businesses.  Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement.  The Court can find little, if any, other personal property that Valdez taxes.  Because its value-related property tax on mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles applies only if they are \xe2\x80\x9caffixed\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular site, it taxes those vehicles as a form of real, not personal, property.  Valdez also claims that its ship tax is simply another form of a value-based tax on oil-related property provided by state law.  But Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax, a purely a municipal tax, differs from the tax on other oil-related property, which is primarily a state-level tax, in several ways.  As a result of these differences, an ordinary oil-related business finding the tax on its movable property too burdensome must complain to the State, which is in charge of setting the manner of assessment and valuation.  At the same time, an oil tanker finding its vessel tax too burdensome must complain to Valdez, for the State has nothing to do with that tax\xe2\x80\x99s rate, valuation, or assessment.  There is also no effective electorate-related check on Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s vessel-taxing power comparable to the check available when a property tax is more broadly imposed.  Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s property tax hits only ships; it is not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business property alike.  Thus, Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax lacks the safeguards implied by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that a property tax on ships escapes the Tonnage Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope only when that tax is imposed upon ships \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as it is imposed on other forms of property.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the city\xe2\x80\x99s argument that its tax may be sustained as a property tax similar to ones the city imposes on other property should be rejected because an unconstitutional tax on maritime commerce does not become permissible when bundled with taxes on other activities or property.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito agreed that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the tax is an unconstitutional duty of tonnage even if the Tonnage Clause permits a true, evenhanded property tax to be applied to vessels.

I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 3.  The city of Valdez, Alaska, has enacted an ordinance that imposes a personal property tax upon the value of large ships that travel to and from that city.  We hold that the ordinance violates the Clause. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n     In 1999, the city of Valdez, Alaska (City), adopted an ordinance imposing a personal property tax upon \xe2\x80\x9c[b]oats and vessels of at least 95 feet in length\xe2\x80\x9d that regularly travel to the City, are kept or used within the City, or which annually take on at least $1 million worth of cargo or engage in other business transactions of comparable value in the City.  Valdez Ordinance No. 99\xe2\x80\x9317 (1999) (codified as Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.020 (2008)).  The ordinance contains exceptions that, in effect, limit the tax\xe2\x80\x99s applicability primarily to large oil tankers.  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the City applies the tax in accordance with a value-allocation system that adjusts the amount owed downwards insofar as the tankers spend time in other ports.  Valdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00\xe2\x80\x9315, App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\xe2\x80\x9356a.</p>\n<p align="left">     Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, owns vessels that transport crude oil from a terminal in the Port of Valdez (located at the southern end of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System) to refineries in California, Hawaii, and Washington.  In August 2000, Polar Tankers filed a lawsuit in Alaska Superior Court challenging the tax as unconstitutional.  Polar Tankers argued that the tax effectively imposed a fee on certain vessels for the privilege of entering the port; hence it amounted to a constitutionally forbidden \xe2\x80\x9cDuty of Tonnage.\xe2\x80\x9d  It also argued that the tax calculation method (as applied to vessels with a tax situs elsewhere) violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses by failing to take account of the time a ship spent at sea or being serviced or repaired.  Polar Tankers said that the method thereby overstated the percentage of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s total earning capacity reasonably allocated to time spent in the Port of Valdez.</p>\n<p>\n\n      The Alaska Superior Court rejected the Tonnage Clause claim, but it accepted the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim.  And, for that reason, it held the tax unconstitutional.  On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court, rejecting both claims, upheld the tax.  In respect to the Tonnage Clause claim, the Supreme Court noted that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax was a value-based property tax designed to pay for \xe2\x80\x9cservices available to all taxpayers in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d including Polar Tankers; and it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ca charge based on the value of property is not a duty of tonnage.\xe2\x80\x9d 182 P.\xc2\xa03d 614, 623 (2008) (citing <em>Transportation Co.</em> v. <em>Wheeling</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/273/index.html">99 U. S. 273</a> (1879))<em>. </em>  In respect to the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim, the Supreme Court held that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s allocation method was fair, hence constitutional.  182 P. 3d, at 617\xe2\x80\x93622.</p>\n<p>\n\n      Polar Tankers asked us to review the Alaska Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.

And we consequently need not consider Polar Tankers\xe2\x80\x99 alternative Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n      When the Framers originally wrote the Tonnage Clause, the words it uses, \xe2\x80\x9cDuty of Tonnage,\xe2\x80\x9d referred in commercial parlance to \xe2\x80\x9ca duty\xe2\x80\x9d imposed upon a ship, which duty varies according to \xe2\x80\x9cthe internal cubic capacity of a vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, its tons of carrying capacity.  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/261/index.html">296 U. S. 261</a>, 265 (1935) (citing <em>Inman S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</em> v. <em>Tinker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/94/238/index.html">94 U. S. 238</a>, 243 (1877)); see also T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 596 (6th ed. 1890).  Over a century ago, however, this Court found that the Framers intended those words to refer to more than \xe2\x80\x9ca duty\xe2\x80\x9d that sets a \xe2\x80\x9ccertain rate on each ton\xe2\x80\x9d of capacity. <em>Steamship Co.</em> v. <em>Portwardens</em>, 6 Wall. 31, 34 (1867). </p>\n<p align="left">     The Court over the course of many years has consistently interpreted the language of the Clause in light of its purpose, a purpose that mirrors the intent of other constitutional provisions which, like the Tonnage Clause itself, seek to \xe2\x80\x9crestrai[n] the states themselves from the exercise\xe2\x80\x9d of the taxing power \xe2\x80\x9cinjuriously to the interests of each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa7497, p. 354 (1833) (abridged version).  Article I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 2, for example, forbids States to \xe2\x80\x9clay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.\xe2\x80\x9d  It thereby seeks to prevent states with \xe2\x80\x9cconvenient ports\xe2\x80\x9d from placing other States at an economic disadvantage by laying levies that would \xe2\x80\x9cta[x] the consumption of their neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 542, 519 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (reprinting James Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787 and letter from James Madison to Professor Davis, 1832).  The coastal States were not to \xe2\x80\x9ctake advantage of their favorable geographical position in order to exact a price for the use of their ports from the consumers dwelling in less advantageously situated parts of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Bowers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/534/index.html">358 U. S. 534</a>, 556\xe2\x80\x93557 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).   </p>\n<p>\n\n     In writing the Tonnage Clause, the Framers recognized that, if \xe2\x80\x9cthe states had been left free to tax the privilege of access by vessels to their harbors the prohibition against duties on imports and exports could have been nullified by taxing the vessels transporting the merchandise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 265.  And the Court has understood the Tonnage Clause as seeking to prevent that nullification.  See <em>Steamship Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335; see also <em>Packet Co.</em> v. <em>Keokuk</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/95/80/index.html">95 U. S. 80</a>, 87 (1877); <em>Gibbons</em> v. <em>Ogden</em>, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824).  It has also understood the Clause as reflecting an effort to diminish a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain certain geographical vessel-related tax advantages whether the vessel in question transports goods between States and foreign nations or, as here, only between the States.  Compare <em>Inman, supra</em> (invalidating a fee applied to ships engaged in foreign commerce), with <em>Steamship Co</em>., <em>supra</em> (invalidating a tax applied to ships engaged in interstate commerce).  </p>\n<p>\n\n     Interpreting the Clause in light of its \xe2\x80\x9cintent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 34, the Court has read its language as forbidding a State to \xe2\x80\x9cdo that indirectly which she is forbidden . . . to do directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Passenger Cases</em>, 7 How. 283, 458 (1849).   Thus, the Court has said that the Clause, which literally forbids a State to \xe2\x80\x9clevy a duty or tax . . . graduated on the tonnage,\xe2\x80\x9d must also forbid a State to \xe2\x80\x9ceffect the same purpose by merely changing the ratio, and graduating it on the number of masts, or of mariners, the size and power of the steam-engine, or the number of passengers which she carries.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id</em>., at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  A State cannot take what would otherwise amount to a tax on the ship\xe2\x80\x99s capacity and evade the Clause by calling that tax \xe2\x80\x9ca charge on the owner or supercargo,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby \xe2\x80\x9cjustify[ing] this evasion of a great principle by producing a dictionary or a dictum to prove that a ship-captain is not a vessel, nor a supercargo an import.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 459.</p>\n<p>\n\n    The Court has consequently stated that the Tonnage Clause prohibits, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only a <em>pro\xc2\xa0rata </em>tax . . ., but any duty on the ship, whether a fixed sum upon its whole tonnage, or a sum to be ascertained by comparing the amount of tonnage with the rate of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Steamship Co., supra</em>, at 35.  And, summarizing earlier cases while speaking for a unanimous Court, Justice Stone concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines, supra</em>, at 265\xe2\x80\x93266.  Cf.  <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>New Orleans</em>, 20 Wall. 577 (1874) (invalidating a tax imposed on ships entering a port, which tax was graduated based on the ships\xe2\x80\x99 capacity and length of stay); <em>Inman</em>, <em>supra</em> (invalidating a fee imposed on ships of a certain capacity that entered a port); <em>Steamship Co., supra</em> (invalidating a flat tax imposed on every ship that entered a port, regardless of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s capacity).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Clause forbids all charges, whatever their form, that impose \xe2\x80\x9ca charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port,\xe2\x80\x9d nothing in the history of the adoption of the Clause, the purpose of the Clause, or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Clause suggests that it operates as a ban on <em>any and all</em> taxes which fall on vessels that use a State\xe2\x80\x99s port, harbor, or other waterways.  See <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Such a radical proposition would transform the Tonnage Clause from one that protects vessels, and their owners, from discrimination by seaboard States, to one that gives vessels preferential treatment vis-\xc3\x80-vis all other property, and its owners, in a seaboard State.  The Tonnage Clause cannot be read to give vessels such \xe2\x80\x9cpreferential treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Michelin Tire Corp.</em> v. <em>Wages</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/276/index.html">423 U. S. 276</a>, 287 (1976) (noting, in a related context, that the Import-Export Clause \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be read to accord imported goods preferential treatment that permits escape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to foreign origin for services which the State supplies\xe2\x80\x9d).

Certainly, the ordinance that imposes the tax would seem designed to do so.  It says that the tax applies to ships that travel to (and leave) the City\xe2\x80\x99s port regularly for business purposes, that are kept in the City\xe2\x80\x99s port, that take on more than $1 million in cargo in that port, or that are involved in business transactions in that amount there.  In practice, the tax applied in its first year to 28 vessels, of which 24 were oil tankers, 3 were tugboats, and 1 was a passenger cruise ship.  App. 53.  The ordinance applies the tax to no other form of personal property.  See Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.030(A)(2) (2008).  </f></p>\n<p>\n\n     Moreover, the tax\xe2\x80\x99s application and its amount depend upon the ship\xe2\x80\x99s capacity.  That is to say, the tax applies only to large ships (those at least 95 feet in length), while exempting small ones.  See \xc2\xa73.12.020(A)(1).  </p>\n<p align="left">     Nor can Valdez escape application of the Clause by claiming that the ordinance imposes, not a duty or a tax, but a fee or a charge for \xe2\x80\x9cservices rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cpilotage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwharfage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmedical inspection,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of locks,\xe2\x80\x9d or the like.  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines, </em>296 U.

See 182 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 623; Valdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00\xe2\x80\x9315, App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\xe2\x80\x9356a. Tonnage Clause precedent makes clear that, where a tax otherwise qualifies as a duty of tonnage, a general, revenue-raising purpose argues in favor of, not against, application of the Clause.  See <em>Steamship Co., </em>6 Wall.<em>, </em>at 34. </p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause forbids.  The ordinance applies almost exclusively to oil tankers.  And a tax on the value of such vessels is closely correlated with cargo capacity.  Because the imposition of the tax depends on a factor related to tonnage and that tonnage-based tax is not for services provided to the vessel, it is unconstitutional.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent contends that the tax does not operate as \xe2\x80\x9ca charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines, supra</em>, at 265\xe2\x80\x93266\xe2\x80\x94that is, as an impermissible tonnage duty\xe2\x80\x94because Valdez levies its tax only upon vessels that meet a \xe2\x80\x9ctax situs\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  But in this case, the distinction the dissent draws between tonnage duties and property taxes is a distinction without a difference.  That is because to establish a tax situs under the tax challenged here, an oil tanker needs only to enter the port and load oil worth more than $1 million.  And, as Polar Tankers notes, oil tankers routinely carry millions of barrels of oil at a time worth well in excess of $1 million.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 6.  Thus, by virtue of a single entry into the port, \xe2\x80\x9ctrading\xe2\x80\x9d once in that port, or \xe2\x80\x9clying\xe2\x80\x9d once in that port, a tanker automatically establishes a tax situs in Valdez.  No one claims that this basis for establishing a tax situs is insufficient under the Constitution.  After all, a nondomiciliary jurisdiction may constitutionally tax property when that property has a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d with that jurisdiction, and such a nexus is established when the taxpayer \xe2\x80\x9cavails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business\xe2\x80\x9d in that jurisdiction.  See <em>Japan Line, Ltd.</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/index.html"></a><a href="/us/441/434/index.html">441 U.

Here, the City identified the 28 vessels that were subject to the tax in the year 2000.  But the City fails to point to a single oil tanker, or any vessel greater than 95 feet in length, that both entered the port and failed to establish a tax situs.  See App. 53.  What else is needed to show that a tax characterized as one on property may nevertheless function as a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge for the privilege of entering . . . a port\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p>\n\n     Valdez does not deny that its tax operates much like a duty applied exclusively to ships.  But, like the Alaska Supreme Court, it points to language in an earlier Court opinion explicitly stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]axes levied . . . upon ships . . . as property, based on a valuation of the same as property, are not within the prohibition of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, 12 Wall. 204, 213 (1871) (emphasis deleted); cf. 182 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 622, and n. 43.  Valdez says that its tax is just such a value-related tax on personal property and consequently falls outside the scope of the Clause.  Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n     Our problem with this argument, however, is that the Court later made clear that the Clause does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9ctaxation\xe2\x80\x9d of vessels \xe2\x80\x9cas property <em>in the same manner </em>as other personal property owned by citizens of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here\xe2\x80\x9d vessels \xe2\x80\x9care not taxed <em>in the same manner </em>as the other property of the citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition . . . comes into play.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wheeling</em>, 99 U. S., at 284 (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p>\n\n      Viewed in terms of the purpose of the Clause, this qualification is important.  It means that, in order to fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon other businesses.  And that fact may well operate as a check upon a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to impose a tax on ships at rates that reflect an effort to take economic advantage of the port\xe2\x80\x99s geographically based position.  After all, the presence of other businesses subject to the tax, particularly businesses owned and operated by state residents, threatens political concern and a potential ballot-box issue, were rates, say, to get out of hand.  See <em>Cooley</em> v. <em>Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots</em>, 12 How. 299, 315 (1852); cf. <em>South Carolina Highway Dept.</em> v. <em>Barnwell Brothers, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/303/177/index.html">303 U.

It does not tax vessels \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner as other personal property\xe2\x80\x9d of those who do business in Valdez.  <em>Wheeling</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 284.  We can find little, if any, other personal property that it taxes.  According to the State of Alaska, Valdez specifically exempts from property taxation motor vehicles, aircraft, and other vehicles, as well as  business machinery.  See Dept. of Community and Economic Development, Division of Community and Business Development, Office of the State Assessor, Alaska Taxable 2001, p.\xc2\xa020 (Jan. 2002), (Table 4), online at http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/Taxable/AKTaxable2001.pdf (as visited June 10, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).   </f></p>\n<p align="left">     We concede, as Valdez points out, that a different Valdez ordinance imposes what it characterizes as a  value-based property tax on mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles. Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.022 (2008); Brief for Respondent 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  But that same ordinance exempts those vehicles from its property tax unless they are \xe2\x80\x9caffixed\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular site.   Hence, whatever words the City uses to describe the tax imposed on mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles, Valdez in fact taxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form, not of personal property, but of real property (like a home).  See \xc2\xa73.12.022  (providing that \xe2\x80\x9ctrailers and mobile homes\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9csubject to taxation\xe2\x80\x9d when they are classified as \xe2\x80\x9creal property\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n     Valdez also points to a separate City ordinance that imposes a tax \xe2\x80\x9con all taxable property taxable under Alaska Statutes Chapter 43.56.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73.28.010 (2008). The Alaska Statutes Chapter identifies as taxable \xe2\x80\x9caircraft and motor vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d the operation of which \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cexploration for, production of, or pipeline transportation of gas or unrefined oil.\xe2\x80\x9d  Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa743.56.210 (2008).  Valdez claims that its tax on ships is simply another form of this value-related tax on oil-related property. </p>\n<p>\n\n     Valdez did not make this claim in the lower courts, however.  Nor does the State of Alaska (which has filed a brief in support of Valdez) support this particular claim. Brief for State of Alaska et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  Thus, we lack the State\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of just how the tax on oil-related vehicles works.  And, lacking precise information, we might ordinarily decline to consider this claim.  See, <em>e.g., Clingman</em> v. <em>Beaver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/581/index.html">544 U. S. 581</a>, 597\xe2\x80\x93598 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n     Nonetheless, the parties have argued the matter in their briefs here; and our deciding the matter now will reduce the likelihood of further litigation.  We may make exceptions to our general approach to claims not raised below; and for these reasons we shall do so.  See <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/33/index.html">492 U. S. 33</a>, 39 (1989). </p>\n<p>\n\n     Addressing the claim on the basis of the briefs and what we have gleaned from publicly available sources, we note that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s ship tax differs from the tax on other oil-related property in several ways.  The former is a purely municipal tax.  The City imposes it; the City alone determines what property is subject to the tax; the City establishes the rate of taxation; the City values the property; the City resolves evaluation disputes; the City issues assessment notices; the City collects the tax; and the City (as far as we can tell) keeps the revenue without any restrictions.  See Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.020(A)(1) (2008); \xc2\xa73.12.060; \xc2\xa73.12.020(B); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73.12.090\xe2\x80\x933.12.100; \xc2\xa73.12.210(A) (2001); Valdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00\xe2\x80\x9315, App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\xe2\x80\x9356a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     The latter is primarily a state-level tax. The State imposes it. In fact, Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s city manager characterized the oil-property tax as involving \xe2\x80\x9cproperty taxed by the State . . . and [raising revenue] subsequently shared with the City.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 46 (affidavit of Dave Dengel).  In addition, the State determines the type of property subject to the tax; the State forbids the municipality to exempt any property it designates as taxable; the State regulates the rate of taxation that may be applied to property it designates as taxable; the State issues assessment notices; the State resolves evaluation disputes; and the State, while permitting the municipality to set the precise tax rate and to collect the tax, imposes certain kinds of limits upon the amount of the resulting revenue that the municipality may raise that, in effect, provide a check against excessive rates.  See Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa743.56.010(b) (2008); \xc2\xa743.56.210(5)(A); 15 Alaska Admin. Code \xc2\xa756.010 (2009); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa756.015\xe2\x80\x9356.040; Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa729.45.080(b), (c) (2008); \xc2\xa743.56.010(c).    </p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These differences matter.  For one thing, they mean that any ordinary oil-related business, other than ships, that finds the tax imposed upon its movable property too burdensome must complain to the State, not to the City, for it is the State that is in charge of setting the manner of assessment and valuation.  At the same time, an oil tanker that finds the vessel tax too burdensome must complain to the City, not to the State, for the State has nothing to do with the rate, valuation, or assessment of that particular tax.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, they mean that there is no effective electorate-related check (comparable to the check available where a property tax is more broadly imposed) upon the City\xe2\x80\x99s vessel-taxing power.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s property tax hits ships and only ships; it is not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business property alike.  Taken together, these two considerations mean that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s property tax lacks the safeguards implied by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that a property tax on ships escapes the scope of the Tonnage Clause only when that tax is imposed upon ships \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner\xe2\x80\x9d as it is imposed on other forms of property.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice contends that a State may never impose a property tax on a vessel belonging to a citizen of another State, even if that vessel is taxed in the \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d as other personal property in the taxing state.  See <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But, as The Chief Justice concedes, this Court held in the <em>State Tonnage Tax</em> <em>Cases</em> and <em>Wheeling</em> that vessels belonging to a State\xe2\x80\x99s own citizens may be subject to a property tax when the vessels are taxed in the same manner as other personal property owned by citizens of that State.  At the time those cases were decided, the home port doctrine was still in effect, which meant that vessels were taxable solely by the owner\xe2\x80\x99s domicile State.  Since the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em> and <em>Wheeling</em>, the home port doctrine has been abandoned and States are now permitted to tax vessels belonging to citizens of other States that develop a tax situs in the nondomiciliary State, provided the tax is fairly apportioned.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ott</em> v. <em>Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/169/index.html">336 U. S. 169</a>, 172\xe2\x80\x93174 (1949); <em>Japan Line, Ltd. </em>v.<em> County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/index.html"></a><a href="/us/441/434/index.html">441 U. S. 434</a>, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (1979).  Given this evolution in the law governing interstate taxation since our decisions in the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases </em>and <em>Wheeling</em>, there is little reason to think that the ability of a State to tax vessels in the \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d as other personal property applies only to vessels owned by citizens of the taxing State.  In any event, we need not decide this issue because it is clear that the vessels subject to the City\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance are not taxed in the same manner as other personal property.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n     As far as we can tell, then, Valdez applies a value-based personal property tax to ships and to no other property at all.  It does so in order to obtain revenue for general city purposes.  The tax, no less than a similar duty, may (depending upon rates) \xe2\x80\x9cta[x] the consumption\xe2\x80\x9d of those in other states.  See 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 519 (reprinting letter from James Madison to Professor Davis, 1832).  It is consequently the kind of tax that the Tonnage Clause forbids Valdez to impose without the consent of Congress, consent that Valdez lacks.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the tax is unconstitutional.

The plurality goes on, however, to reject the city\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the tax may be sustained as a property tax similar to ones the city imposes on other property.  The plurality rejects that argument on the ground that the city in fact does <em>not</em> impose similar taxes on other property.  <em>Ante,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  I would instead reject the argument on the ground that it does not matter.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tonnage Clause applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany Duty of Tonnage,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of how that duty compares to other commercial taxes.  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 3.  The free flow of maritime commerce was so important to the Framers that they grouped the prohibition on tonnage duties with bans on keeping troops or ships of war, entering into compacts with other States or foreign powers, and engaging in war.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In light of the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 goal to promote trade, and the language of the Clause, I do not see how an unconstitutional tax on maritime commerce becomes permissible when bundled with taxes on other activities or property.  If States wish to use their geographical position to tax national maritime commerce, they must get Congress\xe2\x80\x99s consent\xe2\x80\x94just as they must to engage in the other activities prohibited by Clause 3.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority responds that nothing in the history of the Clause, its purpose, or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of it suggests that it bans all taxes on vessels using a port.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s list of interpretive tools tellingly leaves out one\xe2\x80\x94the words the Framers used.  The Clause by its terms provides that \xe2\x80\x9cNo State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay <em>any</em> Duty of Tonnage.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I., \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa03 (emphasis added).  The majority correctly concludes that the Valdez tax is a tonnage duty, <em>ante</em>, at 7, and that should be the end of the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also objects that this approach would give vessels \xe2\x80\x9cpreferential treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d when the Clause only protects vessels from discrimination.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But the Clause says nothing about discrimination, and it should hardly come as a surprise that a constitutional ban on tonnage duties would give preferential treatment to vessels.  Such protection reflects the high value the Framers placed on the free flow of maritime commerce.  See <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, 12 Wall. 204, 214 (1871) (\xe2\x80\x9cPrior to the adoption of the Constitution the States . . . levied duties on imports and exports and duties of tonnage, and it was the embarrassments growing out of such regulations and conflicting obligations which mainly led to the abandonment of the Confederation and to the more perfect union under the present Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality appears to be driven to its tax-comparison analysis only in responding to the city\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the tax is exempt from the Tonnage Clause under the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>,<em> supra</em>, and <em>Transportation Co.</em> v. <em>Wheeling</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/273/index.html">99 U. S. 273</a> (1879).  Neither of those cases has any bearing here.  Both cases make clear that they apply only to taxation of property owned by citizens of the State.  See <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 213 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]axes levied by a State upon ships and vessels <em>owned by the citizens of the State</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Wheeling</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 284 (\xe2\x80\x9cProperty . . . <em>when belonging to a citizen of the State</em> living within her territory . . . is the subject of State taxation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  We have never held that the Tonnage Clause allows such property taxes to be imposed on visiting ships.  Doing so would allow easy evasion of the important principles of the Clause.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the plurality and Justice Stevens suggest that the evolution of the \xe2\x80\x9chome port doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d sheds light on how to read the Tonnage Clause.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313; <em>post</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa01 (dissenting opinion).  I disagree.  Under the home port doctrine, Polar Tankers \xe2\x80\x9ccould not be taxed in [Valdez] at all,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the tax were not a tonnage duty.  <em>Japan Line, Ltd.</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/index.html">441 U. S. 434</a>, 442 (1979); <em>Hays</em> v. <em>Pacific Mail S. S. Co.</em>, 17 How. 596, 599 (1855).  In contrast, the Tonnage Clause forbids only tonnage duties, and would permit Valdez to impose other taxes on visiting ships\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable charge for\xe2\x80\x9d the service of \xe2\x80\x9cpolicing of a harbor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clyde Mallory Lines</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel.

The demise of the home port doctrine is in no way inconsistent with reading the Tonnage Clause, as written, to ban all tonnage duties.  See <em>Japan Line</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 439, n.\xc2\xa03 (rejecting home port doctrine while expressly not reaching Tonnage Clause argument).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any case, because the Court has determined that Valdez\xe2\x80\x99s tax is unlike other municipal taxes, it does not decide whether a tonnage duty would be unconstitutional when other similar property is taxed.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13; <em>post</em>, at 1 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).

See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Thus, the pertinent inquiry in determining whether an exaction violates the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions is whether the charge is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in its essence a contribution claimed for the privilege of arriving and departing from a port.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Transportation Co.</em> v. <em>Wheeling</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/273/index.html"></a><a href="/us/99/273/index.html">99 U.

In applying that principle, we have been cognizant of its limits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By its terms, the Tonnage Clause prohibits States from imposing a duty on ships based on their internal cubic capacity, see <em>id.</em>, at 265, and it similarly prohibits charges that \xe2\x80\x9ceffect the same purpose\xe2\x80\x9d as a duty of tonnage\xe2\x80\x94for instance, by imposing a duty based \xe2\x80\x9con the number of masts, or of mariners, the size and power of the steam-engine, or the number of passengers which she carries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Passenger Cases</em>, 7 How. 283, 458\xe2\x80\x93459 (1849) (opinion of Grier, J.).  By contrast, charges levied for other purposes are outside the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  This Court has often approved charges for services rendered to ships to ensure their safe and convenient use of a port.  See <em>Clyde Mallory</em>, 296 U. S., at 266\xe2\x80\x93267.  And the federal interest in protecting access to the ports generally does not prevent States from charging shipowners those taxes and fees that the States are also authorized to levy on other property.  See <em>Wiggins Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>East St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/365/index.html">107 U.

S., at 279 (upholding a property tax on ships).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More than a century ago, we noted that it was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo well settled to admit of question that taxes levied by a State, upon ships or vessels owned by the citizens of the State, as property, based on a valuation of the same as property, to the extent of such ownership, are not within the prohibition of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Just as \xe2\x80\x9c[d]raymen may be compelled to pay a license tax on every dray owned by them, hackmen on every hack, [and] tavernkeepers on their taverns in proportion to the number of the rooms which they keep for the accommodation of guests,\xe2\x80\x9d so too can a State charge the operator of a ferry a \xe2\x80\x9ctax upon the boats which he employs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins Ferry</em>, 107 U. S., at 375.  \xe2\x80\x9c[V]essels of all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same manner as other personal property owned by citizens of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wheeling</em>, 99 U. S., at 284; <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, 12 Wall. 204, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1871).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From <em>Wheeling </em>and the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, two principles emerge regarding the circumstances under which States may levy property taxes on ships.  First, the State seeking to levy the tax must show that the ship has sufficient contacts with the jurisdiction to establish a tax situs there.  In our earlier cases, the existence of the situs was determined by the citizenship of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s owner, see <em>Wheeling</em>, 99 U. S., at 279; <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>, 12 Wall., at 213, but a tax situs can also be created by a property\xe2\x80\x99s substantial contacts with a jurisdiction.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The requirement of a tax situs serves to distinguish property taxes from fees charged for the privilege of entering a port, which the Court has consistently found to violate the prohibition against duties of tonnage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cannon</em>, 20 Wall., at 581 (holding unconstitutional \xe2\x80\x9ca tax upon every vessel which stops\xe2\x80\x9d in the city\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional waters); <em>Steamship Co.</em> v. <em>Portwardens</em>, 6 Wall. 31, 33 (1867) (invalidating a tax imposed \xe2\x80\x9cupon every ship entering the port\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccollected upon every entry\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases also require that property taxes on ships, as with other property, be calculated based on the ship\xe2\x80\x99s value.  When a State levies a property tax on ships, the prohibition of the Tonnage Clause comes into play only if the ships are \xe2\x80\x9cnot taxed in the same manner as the other property of the citizens, or where the tax is imposed upon the vessel as an instrument of commerce, without reference to the value as property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wheeling</em>, 99 U. S., at 284.  Although the meaning of <em>Wheeling</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d language is not immediately apparent, the remainder of the opinion emphasizes the importance of the method by which the tax on the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ships was calculated\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a valuation of the same as property\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than the city\xe2\x80\x99s taxation of other property in the jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 279; see <em>id.</em>, at 284.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em> is to the same effect, as we held that taxes levied on ships \xe2\x80\x9c<em>as property, based on a valuation of the same </em>as property, are not within the prohibition of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d but if States tax ships \xe2\x80\x9cby a tonnage duty, or indirectly by imposing the tax upon the master or crew, they assume a jurisdiction which they do not possess.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 Wall., at 213, 214 (emphasis in original).  Indeed, each of the taxes challenged in that case was invalidated because it was \xe2\x80\x9clevied on the steamboats wholly irrespective of the value of the vessels as property, and solely and exclusively on the basis of their cubical contents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 217; see <em>id.</em>, at 224 (holding the tax unconstitutional because \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of the tax depends upon the carrying capacity of the steamboat and not upon her value as property\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Thus, in both <em>Wheeling </em>and the <em>State Tonnage Tax Cases</em>,<em> </em>the method by which the challenged tax was calculated was essential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of its validity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tax in this case has both of the critical characteristics of a legitimate property tax.  It is undisputed that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ships \xe2\x80\x9care taxed based on their value, and only those [ships] that have acquired a taxable situs in Valdez are taxed.\xe2\x80\x9d  182 P.\xc2\xa03d 614, 622 (Alaska 2008).  Accordingly, I would uphold the Alaska Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision sustaining the tax against petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Tonnage Clause challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion because it reads <em>Wheeling</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d language to impose a different limitation on the States\xe2\x80\x99 power to tax ships.  According to the plurality, \xe2\x80\x9cin order to fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon other businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  As discussed above, <em>Wheeling</em> and the <em>State Tonnage Cases </em>are better read to require that property taxes on ships be assessed based on the value of the ship rather than its tonnage.  But even if the \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d requirement did not clearly refer to the method of calculating the tax, the phrase could not bear the weight the plurality places on it.  And there is no other support in our cases or in the text of the Tonnage Clause for a rule that conditions a State\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its admitted authority to levy property taxes on ships upon its decision also to tax other property within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the same tax could be a \xe2\x80\x9cDuty of Tonnage\xe2\x80\x9d in one instance and not in another depending on taxing decisions wholly outside the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Far from being compelled by our earlier cases, this rule is in tension with our decisions noting the substantial flexibility States must be afforded in making taxing decisions and cautioning courts not to \xe2\x80\x9csubject the essential taxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Conway</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/281/146/index.html">281 U. S. 146</a>, 159 (1930).  That tension is compounded by the inevitable difficulty States will have in navigating the new rule, as the plurality does not suggest at what point a State can be satisfied that it has taxed enough other property that it may also tax ships without violating the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the plurality asserts that the rule \xe2\x80\x9chelps to assure that a value-related property tax differs significantly from a graduated tax on a ship\xe2\x80\x99s capacity and that the former is not simply a redesignation of the latter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  But our cases provide such assurance without resort to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s strained reading.  Because States and their political subdivisions only have authority to tax property that has established a tax situs in the jurisdiction, they cannot levy such taxes on ships merely for the privilege of entering or leaving the port; much more substantial contact with the jurisdiction is required.  See Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.020(C) (2008); <em>Central R. Co. of Pa.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/607/index.html">370 U. S. 607</a>, 614\xe2\x80\x93615 (1962). <font b="1"> And it is that contact, rather than entry into the port, that provides the basis for taxing the ships.  The tax situs<em> </em>requirement thus ensures that a State cannot avoid the proscriptions of the Tonnage Clause by redesignating a duty charged for the privilege of entering the port as an ad\xc2\xa0valorem<em> </em>tax.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts of this case illustrate the point.  Most of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ships spend 40-to-50 days per year in the Port of Valdez.  See App. 32\xe2\x80\x9345.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a group the tankers form a continuous presence in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d  182 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 623.  The ships\xe2\x80\x99 prolonged physical presence and extensive commercial activities in the city have a substantial impact on the city\xe2\x80\x99s resources.  On average, the ships\xe2\x80\x99 presence adds 550 people to the population of Valdez, increasing the city\xe2\x80\x99s total population by 10%.  Those people, as well as the ships themselves, require numerous public services, including harbor facilities, roads, bridges, water supply, and fire and police protection.  <em>Ibid.</em>\xc2\xa0 As the Alaska Supreme Court concluded, the challenged tax is therefore a legitimate property tax levied to support the ships\xe2\x80\x99 use of the city\xe2\x80\x99s services.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Tonnage Clause were properly understood to permit a jurisdiction to levy a tax on ships only when other property in the jurisdiction is also taxed, I would uphold the challenged tax.  Although the tax applies only to ships, see Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.12.020, other property in the city is also subject to taxation.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xc2\xa73.12.022 imposes a value-based property tax on trailers, mobile homes, and recreational vehicles that are affixed to a site and connected to utilities.  The plurality makes much of the requirement that the property be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98affixed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to a particular site, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cValdez in fact taxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form, not of personal property, but of real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante</em>, at 10.  But the taxability of property pursuant to \xc2\xa73.12.022 is determined in much the same way as the taxability of ships.  \xe2\x80\x9cA trailer or mobile home is conclusively presumed to be affixed to the land\xe2\x80\x9d and may therefore be taxed if \xe2\x80\x9cit has remained at a fixed site for more than ninety days.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73.12.022(C).  Similarly, a ship owner can establish a tax situs in Valdez and thus be subject to taxation if it is \xe2\x80\x9ckept or used within the city for any ninety days or more.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73.12.020(C)(2)(c).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In both cases, the provision serves to impose a tax on property that has developed substantial contacts with the city.  The plurality is thus wrong to conclude that ships have been singled out for taxation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Valdez also \xe2\x80\x9clevie[s] a tax\xe2\x80\x9d on all property taxable under Alaska Statutes Chapter 43.56 at the same rate that applies to other property taxed by the city.  Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.28.010.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The tax is imposed on property used \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily in the exploration for, production of, or pipeline transportation of gas or unrefined oil,\xe2\x80\x9d including machinery, equipment, pumping stations, powerplants, aircraft and motor vehicles, and docks and other port facilities.  See Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa743.56.010, 43.56.210(5)(A) (2008).  For several reasons, this tax is more significant than the plurality acknowledges.  First, contrary to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, the tax appears to be a municipal tax.  Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.28.010 states that the tax \xe2\x80\x9cis hereby levied\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cproperty taxable under Alaska Statutes Chapter 43.56,\xe2\x80\x9d which in turn states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] municipality may levy\xe2\x80\x9d such taxes, \xc2\xa743.56.010(b).  The terms of these provisions indicate that the city has exercised its express authority to levy such taxes.  Given the myriad types of property taxable under those provisions and the requirement of Valdez Municipal Code \xc2\xa73.28.010 that the property be taxed \xe2\x80\x9cat the rate of taxation that applies to other property taxed by the city,\xe2\x80\x9d it seems clear that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ships are taxed in the \xe2\x80\x9csame manner\xe2\x80\x9d as other property even as the plurality uses that term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My view of the case would be the same even if the tax on property used in oil production were imposed by the State itself, as the plurality assumes.  Whether the oil-production tax and the challenged tax are levied by the same unit of government has no relevance to the question whether the latter violates the Constitution.  The restriction imposed by the Tonnage Clause is a command to the States limiting their inherent taxing authority as sovereigns.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 political subdivisions have no such inherent power and can levy taxes only to the extent authorized by the State.  See 16 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations \xc2\xa744.05, pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9324 (rev. 3d ed. 2003); see also <em>Wiggins Ferry</em>, 107 U. S., at 375 (noting \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he power of [a State] to authorize any city within her limits to impose a license tax\xe2\x80\x9d on ferries).  Indeed, this aspect of the relationship between States and their political subdivisions is reflected in Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa743.56.010(b), which authorizes municipalities to levy certain taxes and prevents them from exempting particular property from taxation.  Because the city\xe2\x80\x99s power to levy taxes derives from the State, whether the city or the State levies the tax on oil-production property is constitutionally irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it bears mention that the result in this particular case does nothing to further the interests the Tonnage Clause was intended to protect.  As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante</em>, at 4,<em> </em>the central purpose of the Clause is \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent the seaboard States, possessed of important ports of entry, from levying taxes on goods flowing through their ports to inland States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Bowers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/534/index.html">358 U. S. 534</a>, 556 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part).  Port Valdez is at the southern terminus of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which carries oil extracted from Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s North Slope to Port Valdez where it is loaded onto oil tankers belonging to petitioner and others for transport to refineries in other States.  Taxes imposed on ships exporting that oil have the same effect on commerce in oil as do taxes on oil-production property or the oil itself, and Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose taxes on oil and oil-production property is undisputed.  From an economic or political point of view, there is no difference between Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s geographical control over the area in which the oil is produced and the port from which it is exported.  Accordingly, no federal interest is served by prohibiting Alaska or its political subdivisions from taxing the oil-bearing ships that are continually present in the State\xe2\x80\x99s ports.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tonnage Clause permits a State to levy a property tax on ships whether or not it taxes other property.  Were that not the case, the challenged tax would still be permissible because Valdez also taxes mobile homes, trailers, and a wide variety of property used in producing oil.  Because the tax in my view does not run afoul of the prohibitions of the Tonnage Clause, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Previously, courts followed the common-law \xe2\x80\x9chome port\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, pursuant to which a ship could be taxed only by the State in which its owner was domiciled.  See <em>Pullman\xe2\x80\x99s Palace Car Co.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/141/18/index.html">141 U. S. 18</a>, 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (1891).  That doctrine has since \xe2\x80\x9cyielded to a rule of fair apportionment among the States,\xe2\x80\x9d permitting any jurisdiction with which a ship has had sufficient contacts to establish a tax situs to levy a property tax on the ship in proportion to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the jurisdiction.  See <em>Japan Line, Ltd.</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/434/index.html">441 U. S. 434</a>, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (1979); see also <em>Standard Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Peck</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/382/index.html">342 U. S. 382</a>, 383 (1952).  We have roundly rejected the doctrine in cases involving ships moving in interstate operations along the inland waters.  See <em>ibid.</em>  And in the context of ocean-going ships, we have referred to the doctrine as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98anachronistic\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and all but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98abandoned,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d noting that \xe2\x80\x9cto rehabilitate the \xe2\x80\x98home port doctrine\xe2\x80\x99 as a tool of Commerce Clause analysis would be somewhat odd.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Japan Line</em>, 441 U.
