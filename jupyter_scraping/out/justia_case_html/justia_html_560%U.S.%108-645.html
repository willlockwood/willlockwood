ABBOTT</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93645.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 12, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 17, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">After the Abbotts, a married couple, moved to Chile and separated, the Chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their minor son, A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A., while awarding petitioner husband visitation rights.  Mr. Abbott also had a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right to consent before Ms. Abbott could take A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. out of the country under Chile Minors Law 16,618 (Minors Law 16,618), art. 49.  When Ms. Abbott brought A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. to Texas without permission from Mr. Abbott or the Chilean family court, Mr. Abbott filed this suit in the Federal District Court, seeking an order requiring his son\xe2\x80\x99s return to Chile under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711601 <em>et seq</em>.  Among its provisions, the Convention seeks \xe2\x80\x9cto secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained in any Contracting State,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 1; provides that such \xe2\x80\x9cremoval or retention \xe2\x80\xa6 is to be considered wrongful where\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person \xe2\x80\xa6 under the law of the State in which the child was [theretofore] habitually resident,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 3<em>(a),</em> and where \xe2\x80\x9cthose rights [had been] actually exercised \xe2\x80\xa6 or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 3<em>(b);</em> and defines \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude \xe2\x80\xa6 the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 5<em>(a).</em>  The District Court denied relief, holding that the father\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne exeat</em> right did not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of custody\xe2\x80\x9d under the Convention and, thus, that the return remedy was not authorized.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A parent has a right of custody under the Convention by reason of that parent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9317.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Convention applies because A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. is under 16; he was a habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are contracting states.  The ICARA instructs the state or federal court in which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide the case in accordance with the Convention.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711603(b), (d).  P.\xc2\xa05. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0That A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of custody\xe2\x80\x9d is shown by the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text, by the U. S. State Department\xe2\x80\x99s views, by contracting states\xe2\x80\x99 court decisions, and by the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s right, while the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure resolve whether that right is a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce the court has decreed\xe2\x80\x9d that one of the parents has visitation rights, that parent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization\xe2\x80\x9d generally \xe2\x80\x9cshall also be required\xe2\x80\x9d before the child may be taken out of the country.  Because Mr. Abbott has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right under article 49.  The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3<em>(a),</em> and Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right is best classified as a \xe2\x80\x9cjoint right of custody,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Convention defines to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 5<em>(a).</em>  Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s right to decide A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence allows him to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d especially given the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.  It also gives him \xe2\x80\x9crights relating to the care of the person of the child,\xe2\x80\x9d in that choosing A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s residence country can determine the shape of his early and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and traditions.  That a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right does not fit within traditional physical-custody notions is beside the point because the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d controls.  This uniform, text-based approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Convention, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under other legal traditions.  In any case, this country has adopted modern conceptions of custody <em>e.g.,</em> joint legal custody, that accord with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s broad definition.  Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Convention requires that any such right be capable of \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  When one parent removes a child without seeking the <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> holder\xe2\x80\x99s consent, it is an instance where the right would have been \xe2\x80\x9cexercised but for the removal or retention,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 3<em>(b).</em>  The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a breach of a <em>ne exeat</em> right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.  Any suggestion that a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right is a right of access is atexual, as a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right is not even arguably a \xe2\x80\x9cright to take a child for a limited period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(b).</em>  Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> order in this case cannot create a right of custody is not dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law 16,618, which do not derive from the order.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is strongly supported and informed by the longstanding view of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Children\xe2\x80\x99s Issues, this country\xe2\x80\x99s Convention enforcement entity, that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights are rights of custody.  The Court owes deference to the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s treaty interpretations.  See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U. S. 176</a>, 185.  There is no reason to doubt this well-established canon here.  The Executive, when dealing with delicate foreign relations matters like international child abductions, possesses a great store of information on practical realities such as the reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpretation and the impact that interpretation may have on the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s view is also substantially informed by the views of sister contracting states on the issue, see <em>El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Tsui Yuan Tseng,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/155/index.html">525 U. S. 155</a>, 176, particularly because the ICARA directs that \xe2\x80\x9cuniform international interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the Convention is part of its framework, see \xc2\xa711601(b)(3)(B).  While the Supreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view, and French courts are divided, a review of the international law confirms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Austria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted the rule that <em>ne exeat</em> rights are rights of custody within the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus on the matter.  And the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s history is fully consistent with the conclusion that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights are just one of the many ways in which custody of children can be exercised.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding also accords with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s objects and purposes.  There is no reason to doubt the ability of other contracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best interests of the children.  To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right, runs counter to the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of deterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier forum.  Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, removal of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent, while requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter abductions and respects the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to prevent harms to the child resulting from abductions.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0While a parent possessing a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be ordered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Convention exception, such as \xe2\x80\x9ca grave risk that \xe2\x80\xa6 return would expose the child to \xe2\x80\xa6 harm or [an] otherwise \xe2\x80\xa6 intolerable situation,\xe2\x80\x9d or the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cage and degree of maturity\xe2\x80\x9d to state a preference, Art. 13<em>(b).</em>  The proper interpretation and application of exceptions may be addressed on remand.

No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\xe2\x80\x9311.  The United States is a contracting state to the Convention; and Congress has implemented its provisions through the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102 Stat. 437, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711601 <em>et seq.</em>  The Convention provides that a child abducted in violation of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d must be returned to the child\xe2\x80\x99s country of habitual residence, unless certain exceptions apply.  Art. 1, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\xe2\x80\x9311, at 7 (Treaty Doc.).  The question is whether a parent has a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of custody\xe2\x80\x9d by reason of that parent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right: the authority to consent before the other parent may take the child to another country.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in England in 1992.  He is a British citizen, and she is a citizen of the United States.  Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s astronomy profession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. was born in 1995.  The Abbotts moved to La Serena, Chile, in 2002.  There was marital discord, and the parents separated in March 2003.  The Chilean courts granted the mother daily care and control of the child, while awarding the father \xe2\x80\x9cdirect and regular\xe2\x80\x9d visitation rights, including visitation every other weekend and for the whole month of February each year.  App. 9.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is commonly known as a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right: a right to consent before Ms. Abbott could take A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. out of Chile.  See Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a (granting a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right to any parent with visitation rights).  In effect a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right imposes a duty on one parent that is a right in the other.  After Mr. Abbott obtained a British passport for A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A., Ms. Abbott grew concerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain.  She sought and obtained a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>of the minor\xe2\x80\x9d order from the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from being taken out of Chile.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean court were pending, the mother removed the boy from Chile without permission from either the father or the court.  A private investigator located the mother and the child in Texas.  In February 2006, the mother filed for divorce in Texas state court.  Part of the relief she sought was a modification of the father\xe2\x80\x99s rights, including full power in her to determine the boy\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence and an order limiting the father to supervised visitation in Texas.  This litigation remains pending.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court, asking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms. Abbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr. Abbott to return to Chile with A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.  In February 2006, the court denied Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s requested relief but granted him \xe2\x80\x9cliberal periods of possession\xe2\x80\x9d of A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. throughout February 2006, provided Mr. Abbott remained in Texas.  App. 42.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2006, Mr. Abbott filed the instant action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  He sought an order requiring his son\xe2\x80\x99s return to Chile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provisions of the ICARA.  In July 2007, after holding a bench trial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District Court denied relief.  The court held that the father\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne exeat </em>right did not constitute a right of custody under the Convention and, as a result, that the return remedy was not authorized.  495 F. Supp. 2d 635, 640.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed on the same rationale.  The court held the father possessed no rights of custody under the Convention because his <em>ne exeat </em>right was only \xe2\x80\x9ca veto right over his son\xe2\x80\x99s departure from Chile.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 F.\xc2\xa03d 1081, 1087 (2008).  The court expressed substantial agreement with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Croll </em>v. <em>Croll</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d 133 (2000).  Relying on American dictionary definitions of \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights cannot be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actually exercised\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention, <em>Croll</em> held that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights are not rights of custody.  <em>Id.,</em> at 138\xe2\x80\x93141 (quoting Art. 3<em>(b)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7).  A dissenting opinion in <em>Croll </em>was filed by then-Judge Sotomayor.  The dissent maintained that a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right is a right of custody because it \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a parent with decisionmaking authority regarding a child\xe2\x80\x99s international relocation.\xe2\x80\x9d  229 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 146.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits adopted the conclusion of the <em>Croll</em> majority.  See <em>Fawcett </em>v. <em>McRoberts</em>, 326 F.\xc2\xa03d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Gutierrez</em>, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 942, 949 (CA9 2002).

A return remedy does not alter the pre&amp;nbhyph;abduction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial decisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence.

A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are contracting states.  The question is whether A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. was \xe2\x80\x9cwrongfully removed\xe2\x80\x9d from Chile, in other words, whether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Convention; the views of the United States Department of State; decisions addressing the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d in courts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the Convention.  After considering these sources, the Court determines that Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right is a right of custody under the Convention.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/491/index.html">552 U. S. 491</a>, 506 (2008).  This Court consults Chilean law to determine the content of Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s right, while following the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure to decide whether the right at issue is a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide his child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence, otherwise known as a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right.  Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce the court has decreed\xe2\x80\x9d that one of the parents has visitation rights, that parent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization \xe2\x80\xa6 shall also be required\xe2\x80\x9d before the child may be taken out of the country, subject to court override only where authorization \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be granted or is denied without good reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Abbott has \xe2\x80\x9cdirect and regular\xe2\x80\x9d visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law, that he has a shared<em> </em>right to determine his son\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence under this provision.  App. 9.  To support the conclusion that Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s right under Chilean law gives him a joint right to decide his son\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence, it is notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Minors Law 16,618 is a \xe2\x80\x9cright to authorize the minors\xe2\x80\x99 exit\xe2\x80\x9d from Chile and that this provision means that neither parent can \xe2\x80\x9cunilaterally\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cestablish the [child\xe2\x80\x99s] place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region Metropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in <em>Villegas Duran</em> v. <em>Arribada</em> <em>Beaumont</em>, No.\xc2\xa008\xe2\x80\x93775, pp. 35a\xe2\x80\x9337a, cert. pending.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7; and Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s joint right to determine his son\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as the Convention defines that term.  The Convention defines \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, <em>ibid.</em>  Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right gives him both the joint \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d and joint \xe2\x80\x9crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s joint right to decide A. J. A.\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence allows him to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses the child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence, especially in light of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.  See Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7.  And even if \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to the child\xe2\x80\x99s street address within a country, a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right still entitles Mr. Abbott to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d that place.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]etermine\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o fix conclusively or authoritatively,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also<em> </em>mean \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o set bounds or limits to,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (1st definition), which is what Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right allows by ensuring that A. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of Chile.  It follows that the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s protection of a parent\xe2\x80\x99s custodial \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d includes a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s joint right to determine A. J. A.\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence also<em> </em>gives him \xe2\x80\x9crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  Few decisions are as significant as the language the child speaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.  These factors, so essential to self-definition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence.  One need only consider the different childhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows up in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea, to understand how choosing a child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence is a right \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the care of the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s right to take part in making this decision as a mere \xe2\x80\x9cveto,\xe2\x80\x9d 542 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1087; but even by that truncated description, the father has an essential role in deciding the boy\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence.  For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his consent to a change in country on A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s moving to a city outside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy position, thus allowing the father to have continued contact with the boy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right does not fit within traditional notions of physical custody is beside the point.  The Convention defines \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is that definition that a court must consult.  This uniform, text-based approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Convention.  It forecloses courts from relying on definitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions that may undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries or in different legal traditions, including the civil-law tradition.  And, in any case, our own legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that accord with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s broad definition.  Joint legal custody, in which one parent cares for the child while the other has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the child\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, has become increasingly common.  See Singer, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family: Implications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363, 366 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in North Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody resolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of all mediated custody agreements\xe2\x80\x9d); E. Maccoby &amp; R. Mnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas of Custody 107 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or 79% of our entire sample, the [California] divorce decree provided for joint legal custody\xe2\x80\x9d); see generally Elrod, Reforming the System to Protect Children in High Conflict Custody Cases, 28 Wm. Mitchell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 495, 505\xe2\x80\x93508 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right is not a right of custody because the Convention requires that any right of custody must be capable of exercise.  The Convention protects rights of custody when \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 3<em>(b)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  In cases like this one, a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right is by its nature inchoate and so has no operative force except when the other parent seeks to remove the child from the country.  If that occurs, the parent can exercise the <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right by declining consent to the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be in the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.  When one parent removes the child without seeking the <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> holder\xe2\x80\x99s consent, it is an instance where the right would have been \xe2\x80\x9cexercised but for the removal or retention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that a breach of a <em>ne exeat </em>right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.  The Convention provides a return remedy when a parent takes a child across international borders in violation of a right of custody.  The Convention provides no return remedy when a parent removes a child in violation of a right of access but requires contracting states \xe2\x80\x9cto promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 21, <em>id., </em>at 11.  For example, a court may force the custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Viragh</em> v. <em>Foldes</em>, 415 Mass. 96, 109\xe2\x80\x93111, 612 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 241, 249\xe2\x80\x93250 (1993), or make other provisions for the noncustodial parent to visit his or her child, see \xc2\xa711603(b) (authorizing petitions to \xe2\x80\x9csecur[e] the effective exercise of rights of access to a child\xe2\x80\x9d).  But unlike rights of access, <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights can only be honored with a return remedy because these<em> </em>rights depend on the child\xe2\x80\x99s location being the country of habitual residence.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any suggestion that a <em>ne exeat</em> right is a \xe2\x80\x9crigh[t] of access\xe2\x80\x9d is illogical and atextual.  The Convention defines \xe2\x80\x9crights of access\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[ing] the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\xe2\x80\x99s habitual residence,\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(b)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7, and ICARA defines that same term as \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation rights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa711602(7).  The joint right to decide a child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence is not even arguably a \xe2\x80\x9cright to take a child for a limited period of time\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation righ[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Reaching the commonsense conclusion that a <em>ne exeat</em> right does not fit these definitions of \xe2\x80\x9crights of access\xe2\x80\x9d honors the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between rights of access and rights of custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ms. Abbott argues that the <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> order in this case cannot create a right of custody because it merely protects a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over the child.  Even if this argument were correct, it would not be dispositive.  Ms. Abbott contends the Chilean court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>order contains no parental consent provision and so awards the father no rights, custodial or otherwise.  See Brief for Respondent 22; but see 495 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 638, n.\xc2\xa03 (the District Court treating the order as containing a consent provision); 542 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals).  Even a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> order issued to protect a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction pending issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing a parent to object to the child\xe2\x80\x99s removal from the country.  This Court need not decide the status of <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>orders lacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the father relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618.  Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s rights derive not from the order but from Minors Law 16,618.  That law requires the father\xe2\x80\x99s consent before the mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to the equitable power family courts retain to override any joint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement.  Minors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, Modern Child Custody Practice \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x9311 (2d ed. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he court remains the final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between joint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having final authority on certain issues affecting the child\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lombardo</em> v. <em>Lombardo</em>, 202 Mich. App. 151, 159, 507 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 788, 792 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the parents as joint custodians cannot agree on important matters such as education, it is the court\xe2\x80\x99s duty to determine the issue in the best interests of the child\xe2\x80\x9d).  The consent provision in Minors Law 16,618 confers upon the father the joint right to determine his child\xe2\x80\x99s country of residence.  This is a right of custody under the Convention.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Mr. Abbott possesses a right of custody under the Convention is supported and informed by the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s view on the issue.  The United States has endorsed the view that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights are rights of custody.  In its brief before this Court the United States advises that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Department of State, whose Office of Children\xe2\x80\x99s Issues serves as the Central Authority for the United States under the Convention, has long understood the Convention as including <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights among the protected \xe2\x80\x98rights of custody.\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21; see <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U.

But the Canadian cases are not precisely on point here.  <em>Thomson</em> ordered a return remedy based on an interim <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>order, and only noted in dicta that it may not order such a remedy pursuant to a permanent <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>order.

At that time, joint custodial arrangements were unknown in many of the contracting states, and the status of <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights was not yet well understood.  See 1980 Conf\xc3\xa9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\xc3\xa9, Enl\xc3\xa8vement d\xe2\x80\x99enfants, morning meeting of Wed., Oct. 8, 1980 (discussion by Messrs.

Since 1980, however, joint custodial arrangements have become more common.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  And, within this framework, most contracting states and scholars now recognize that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights are rights of custody.

See 1980 Conf\xc3\xa9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\xc3\xa9, Enl\xc3\xa8vement d\xe2\x80\x99enfants, E. P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera, Explanatory Report (P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report or Report), in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\xc3\xa8me session, pp. 425\xe2\x80\x93473 (1982).  We need not decide whether this Report should be given greater weight than a scholarly commentary.  Compare Hague International Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analysis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10503\xe2\x80\x9310506 (1986) (identifying the Report as the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the Convention and \xe2\x80\x9ca source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the Convention\xe2\x80\x9d), with P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb68, at 427\xe2\x80\x93428 (\xe2\x80\x9c[the Report] has not been approved by the Conference, and it is possible that, despite the Rapporter\xe2\x80\x99s <em>[sic]</em> efforts to remain objective, certain passages reflect a viewpoint which is in part subjective\xe2\x80\x9d).  It suffices to note that the Report supports the conclusion that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights are rights of custody.  The Report explains that rather than defining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws of different nations pertaining to parental rights, the Convention uses the unadorned term \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d to recognize \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all </em>the ways in which custody of children can be exercised\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9ca flexible interpretation of the terms used, which allows the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb667, 71, at 446, 447\xe2\x80\x93448.  Thus the Report rejects the notion that because <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights do not encompass the right to make medical or some other important decisions about a child\xe2\x80\x99s life they cannot be rights of custody.  Indeed, the Report is fully consistent with the conclusion that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights are just one of the many \xe2\x80\x9cways in which custody of children can be exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xb6 71, at 447.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adopting the view that the Convention provides a return remedy for violations of <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights accords with its objects and purposes.  The Convention is based on the principle that the best interests of the child are well served when decisions regarding custody rights are made in the country of habitual residence.  See Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7.  Ordering a return remedy does not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art. 19, <em>id., </em>at 11, but does allow the courts of the home country to decide what is in the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.  It is the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s premise that courts in contracting states will make this determination in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Custody decisions are often difficult.  Judges must strive always to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own society and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere with objective consideration of all the factors that should be weighed in determining the best interests of the child.  This judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of the Convention, which affirms that the contracting states are \xe2\x80\x9c[f]irmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7.  International law serves a high purpose when it underwrites the determination by nations to rely upon their domestic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right, would run counter to the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes.  Ms. Abbott removed A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. from Chile while Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s request to enhance his relationship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts.  After she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state court to diminish or eliminate the father\xe2\x80\x99s custodial and visitation rights.  The Convention should not be interpreted to permit a parent to select which country will adjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a different country, in violation of a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>right.  Denying a return remedy for the violation of such rights would \xe2\x80\x9clegitimize the very action\xe2\x80\x94removal of the child\xe2\x80\x94that the home country, through its custody order [or other provision of law], sought to prevent\xe2\x80\x9d and would allow \xe2\x80\x9cparents to undermine the very purpose of the Convention.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Croll</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 147 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  This Court should be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that gives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to avoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps deter child abductions and respects the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions.  An abduction can have devastating consequences for a child.  \xe2\x80\x9cSome child psychologists believe that the trauma children suffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of child abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x93390, p.\xc2\xa02 (1993).  A child abducted by one parent is separated from the second parent and the child\xe2\x80\x99s support system.  Studies have shown that separation by abduction can cause psychological problems ranging from depression and acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity-formation issues.  See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse<em> </em>(1999),\xc2\xa0http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm (as visited May 13, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  A child abducted at an early age can experience loss of community and stability, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment.  See Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New Form of Child Abuse<em> </em>(1982), in American Prosecutors Research Institute\xe2\x80\x99s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse, Parental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution of Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A).  Abductions may prevent the child from forming a relationship with the left-behind parent, impairing the child\xe2\x80\x99s ability to mature.  See Faulkner, <em>supra</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While a parent possessing a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is not automatic.  Return is not required if the abducting parent can establish that a Convention exception applies.  One exception states return of the child is not required when \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 13<em>(b)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 10.  If, for example, Ms. Abbott could demonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own safety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this is sufficient to show that the child too would suffer \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological harm\xe2\x80\x9d or be placed \xe2\x80\x9cin an intolerable situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Baran </em>v.<em> Beaty</em>, 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 1340, 1352\xe2\x80\x931353 (CA11 2008); <em>Walsh </em>v.<em> Walsh</em>, 221 F.\xc2\xa03d 204, 220\xe2\x80\x93221 (CA1 2000).  The Convention also allows courts to decline to order removal if the child objects, if the child has reached a sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cage and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 13<em>(b)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 10.

Mr. Abbott possesses only visitation rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s custodial rights, Chilean law placed a restriction: She was not to travel with her son outside of Chile without either Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s or the court\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Put differently, Mr. Abbott had the opportunity to veto Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remove A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. from Chile unless a Chilean court overrode that veto.  The restriction on A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s and Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s travel was an automatic, default provision of Chilean law operative upon the award of visitation rights under Article 48 of Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Minors Law 16,618.

Thus, absent a finding of an exception to the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s powerful return remedy, see <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, and even if the return is contrary to the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests, an American court <em>must</em> now order the return of A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. to Mr. Abbott, who has no legal authority over A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A., based solely on his possessing a limited veto power over Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s ability to take A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. from Chile.

It defines the scope of the available Convention remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article 5 defines these rights as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFor the purposes of this Convention\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c<em>a</em> \xe2\x80\x98rights of custody\xe2\x80\x99 shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c<em>b</em> \xe2\x80\x98rights of access\xe2\x80\x99 shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\xe2\x80\x99s habitual residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\xe2\x80\x9311, at 7 (hereinafter Treaty Doc.).  </p>\n<p align="left">\nArticle 3 of the Convention provides that the removal or retention of a child is \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus in violation of the Convention, only when the removal \xe2\x80\x9cis in breach of the rights of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 3<em>(a)</em>, <em>ibid</em>.  The fact that a removal may be \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that it violates domestic law or violates only \xe2\x80\x9crights of access\xe2\x80\x9d does not make it \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only when a removal is \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 3 may the parent who possesses custody rights force the child\xe2\x80\x99s return to the country of habitual residence under the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s remedial procedures, pursuant to Articles 8 through 20.  For those removals that frustrate a noncustodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crights of access,\xe2\x80\x9d the Convention provides that the noncustodial parent may file an application \xe2\x80\x9cto make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access\xe2\x80\x9d; but he may not force the child\xe2\x80\x99s return.  Art. 21, <em>id.</em>, at 11.  A parent without \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, does not have the power granted by Article 3 to compel the child\xe2\x80\x99s return to his or her country of habitual residence.  His rights are limited to those set forth in Article 21.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Abbott, claiming \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d by virtue of the travel restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott, seeks the return of A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. to Chile.  Such relief is warranted only if A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s removal was \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention; as such, it must have been \xe2\x80\x9cin breach of [Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s] rights of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Art. 3, <em>id.</em>, at 7.  Putting aside the effect of the travel restriction, it is undisputed that Ms. Abbott possesses \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d over A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. while Mr. Abbott would possess \xe2\x80\x9crights of access,\xe2\x80\x9d as those terms are used in the Convention.  Brief for Petitioner 6; Brief for Respondent 6.  The only issue in this case, therefore, is whether Mr. Abbott also possesses \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention by virtue of the travel restriction, or <em>ne exeat </em>clause,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] that Chilean law imposes on Ms. Abbott.  In other words, the question is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d of one parent to veto the other parent\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remove a child from the country, subject to judicial override, belongs in the category of \xe2\x80\x9crights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  In my judgment, it clearly does not, and I need look no further than to the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text to explain why.  See <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/491/index.html">552 U. S. 491</a>, 506 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rights relating to the care of the child.  </em>The Court concludes that the veto power Mr. Abbott has over Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans is equivalent to those rights \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relating to the care of the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  This is so, the Court tells us, because Mr. Abbott has a limited power to keep A. J. A. within Chile\xe2\x80\x99s bounds and, therefore, indirectly to influence \xe2\x80\x9cthe language the child speaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  It is not nearly as self-evident as the Court assumes that Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s veto power carries with it any ability to decide the language A. J. A. speaks or the cultural experiences he will have, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  A. J. A.\xe2\x80\x99s mere presence in Chile does not determine any number of issues, including: whether A. J. A. learns Spanish while there; whether he attends an American school or a British school or a local school; whether he participates in sports; whether he is raised Catholic or Jewish or Buddhist or atheist; whether he eats a vegetarian diet; and on and on.  The travel restriction does <em>not</em> confer upon Mr. Abbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions that are vital to A. J. A.\xe2\x80\x99s physical, psychological, and cultural development.   To say that a limited power to veto a child\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans confers, also, a right \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the care\xe2\x80\x9d of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a custodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a child\xe2\x80\x99s needs and development.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation depends entirely on a broad reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d in the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is, undeniably, broad language.  But, as the Court reads the term, it is so broad as to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d means.  We \xe2\x80\x9ccannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term\xe2\x80\x9d rights of custody in this case, and we should not lose sight of the import of this term in construing the broad words that follow in its wake.<em>  Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (2004).  I suppose it could be said that Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s ability to decide whether  A. J. A. spends the night with one of his friends during a Saturday visit is also a \xe2\x80\x9cright relating to the care of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  Taken in the abstract\xe2\x80\x94and to its most absurd\xe2\x80\x94<em>any</em> decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a right \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d the care of a child.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction the drafters drew between the rights of custody and the rights of access.  Undoubtedly, they were aware of the concept of joint custody.  See P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb671, at 457 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ustody rights may have been awarded \xe2\x80\xa6 to that person in his own right or jointly.  It cannot be otherwise in an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best suited to the general principle of sexual non-discrimination, are gradually being introduced into internal law\xe2\x80\x9d).  But just because rights of custody can be shared by two parents, it does not follow that the drafters intended this limited veto power to be a right of custody.  And yet this, it seems, is how the Court understands the case: Because the drafters intended to account for joint custodial arrangements, they intended for <em>this</em> travel restriction to be joint custody because it could be said, in some abstract sense, to relate to care of the child.  I fail to understand how the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading is faithful to the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose, given that the text expressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental rights.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision converts every noncustodial parent with access rights\xe2\x80\x94at least in Chile\xe2\x80\x94into a custodial parent for purposes of the Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this point, it is important to observe the effect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to classify the travel restriction as a right \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s care.  Mr. Abbott possesses no legal authority presently to exercise care or control of A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A., or to make decisions on his behalf.  The Court would nevertheless read the Convention to require A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s return to a parent without such rights merely because the travel restriction, in an abstract sense, could be said to relate to A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s care.  The Court fails to explain how a parent who otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise \xe2\x80\x9ccharge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csupervision,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmanagement\xe2\x80\x9d over a child, see Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 338 (1986) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s) (5th definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d), can become a joint custodian of a child merely because he can attempt to veto one of the countless decisions the child\xe2\x80\x99s other parent has sole<em> </em>legal authority to make on the child\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>The right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.  </em>The Court also concludes that Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s veto power satisfies the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s definition of custodial rights because it is, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, a \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the significance and meaning of this phrase, both on its face and within the context of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Convention depends on isolating the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cand, in particular, the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a freestanding right separate and apart from the rights related to the care of the child.  I do not agree with this view of the text, nor did the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Convention seeks to be more precise by emphasizing, as an <em>example</em> of the \xe2\x80\x98care\xe2\x80\x99 referred to [in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rights of custody\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause, Art. 5<em>(a)</em>], the right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.  However, if the child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself to determine its own place of residence, the <em>substance</em> of the custody rights will have to be determined in the context of other rights concerning the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb684, at 452 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The drafters thus intended the \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d to be an \xe2\x80\x9cexample\xe2\x80\x9d of what the Convention means by \xe2\x80\x9ccare of the person of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is indicative of the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d of what it means to be a custodial parent.  The definition is not, as the Court would have it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a singular \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98righ[t] of custody,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1; rather, it is a shorthand method to assess what types of rights a parent may have.  The parent responsible for determining where and with whom a child resides, the drafters assumed, would likely <em>also</em> be the parent who has the responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d for the child.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet even assuming, as the Court does, that the \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7<em>,</em> is divisible from the \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d of the child, <em>ibid.</em>, I still fail to understand how a travel restriction on one parent\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an affirmative \xe2\x80\x9c<em>right to determine</em> the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Analyzing its text, in the context of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s focus on distinguishing custodial parents from noncustodial ones, leads me to conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d means the power to set or fix the location of the child\xe2\x80\x99s home.  It does not refer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo determine\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cto fix conclusively or authoritatively\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto settle a question or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 616.  A \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical environment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca building or locality used for a special purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1727.  \xe2\x80\x9cResidence,\xe2\x80\x9d even standing alone, refers to a particular location\xe2\x80\x94and not, more generally, to a nation or country.  In the law, \xe2\x80\x9cresidence\xe2\x80\x9d can mean: \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act or fact of living in a given place for some time\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he place where one actually lives\xe2\x80\x9d; or, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Lay definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cresidence\xe2\x80\x9d similarly describe a specific location: \xe2\x80\x9cthe act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some time\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cthe place where one actually lives or has his home\xe2\x80\x9d; or, \xe2\x80\x9ca temporary or permanent dwelling place, abode, or habitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 1931.  It follows that a \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d describes a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d location in which a child \xe2\x80\x9cactually lives.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of this text depends on its substitution of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x9d for the word \xe2\x80\x9cplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a substitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s international focus.  See <em>Croll</em> v. <em>Croll</em>, 229 F. 3d 133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (reading \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cauthority over the child\xe2\x80\x99s more specific living arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cignores the basic international character of the Hague Convention\xe2\x80\x9d).  But it is inconsistent with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text and purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did.  For example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that rights of custody should be defined by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of the State in which the child was habitually resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 3<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  Had the drafters intended the definition of the child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d in Article 5 to refer to his or her \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d or country of \xe2\x80\x9cresidence,\xe2\x80\x9d they could have defined the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d at issue as \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s State of habitual residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  But they did not, even though they used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cState of habitual residence\xe2\x80\x9d no fewer than four other times elsewhere within the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Moreover, the drafters also explained that \xe2\x80\x9creference[s] to habitual residence in [a] State shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a <em>territorial unit of that State</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 31<em>(a)</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 13 (emphasis added).  The point is: When the drafters wanted to refer to a particular geographic unit, they\ndid so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the drafters elected the formulation \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is also utilized similarly in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9crights of access.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Art. 5<em>(b)</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 7 (defining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rights of access\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to take a child for a limited period of time to a <em>place</em> other than the child\xe2\x80\x99s habitual residence\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And they utilized this phrase only within one particular Article, as opposed to their more frequent use of \xe2\x80\x9cState of habitual residence\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the Convention.  In interpreting statutory text, we ordinarily presume that the use of different words is purposeful and evinces an intention to convey a different meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe refrain from concluding here that the differing language in the two subsections has the same meaning in each.  We would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of treaties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I would give \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d the location-specific meaning its plain text connotes, irrespective of the fact that this Convention concerns international abduction.  The right described by the Convention is the right to decide, conclusively, where a child\xe2\x80\x99s home will be.  And this makes a good deal of sense.  The child lives with the parent who has custodial rights or, in the language of the Convention, \xe2\x80\x9ccare of the person of the child,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 5<em>(a)</em>, Treaty Doc., at 7.  The child\xe2\x80\x99s home\xe2\x80\x94his or her \xe2\x80\x9cplace of residence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is fixed by the custody arrangement.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This comports too with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s decision to privilege the rights of custodians over the rights of those parents with only visitation rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Understanding the effect of a travel restriction.  </em>So, the question we confront is whether a travel restriction on one parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to embark on international travel with his or her child creates in the other parent a \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence\xe2\x80\x9d or the ability \xe2\x80\x9cto fix conclusively\xe2\x80\x9d the child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chome.\xe2\x80\x9d  Before answering this question, it is important to understand the nature of the travel restriction we must classify.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The departure of a minor from Chile\xe2\x80\x94including when that child lives in a married, two-parent household\xe2\x80\x94is governed by Article 49 of \xc2\xa716,618 of that country\xe2\x80\x99s Minors Law.

The statute provides, also, an important backstop in the event a noncustodial parent denies authorization \xe2\x80\x9cwithout good reason\xe2\x80\x9d: A Chilean court may grant the minor or his parent permission to leave the country.  <em>Id.</em>, at 62a.  Finally, if the custodial parent does not return the child to Chile within the time authorized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge may decree the suspension of alimony that may have been decreed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></font></p><font super="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Returning, then, to the question at hand: By virtue of the restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s movement, Mr. Abbott has no \xe2\x80\x9cright to determine [A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s] place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  He cannot \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfix,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csettle,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d the place where A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. \xe2\x80\x9cactually lives or has his home.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  True, the travel restriction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited power to prevent his child from leaving the country without his permission, but it does not grant an affirmative power to fix or set the location of the child\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Mr. Abbott has no power whatever to determine where A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. actually lives within the nearly 300,000 square miles that compose Chile.  Even more important, Mr. Abbott has no power whatever to select another country in which A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. would live, were Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s work to take him to another country altogether.  In sum, a right to object to a proposed departure gives a parent far less authority than a right to determine where the child shall reside.  Moreover, the right to determine where to live within a country, as well as what country to live in, is far broader than the limited right to object to a child\xe2\x80\x99s travel abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Abbott has by virtue of the travel restriction is therefore best understood as relating to his \xe2\x80\x9crights of access,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Convention defines that term\xe2\x80\x94and not as a standalone \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98righ[t] of custody,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court defines it, <em>ante</em>, at 1.  Chile\xe2\x80\x99s statutory travel restriction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights the Chilean family court granted to him as the noncustodial parent.  By its terms, the obligation on the custodial parent to seek the other parent\xe2\x80\x99s permission before removing the child from Chile only operates upon the award of <em>visitation rights;</em> it has nothing to do with <em>custody rights</em>.  And it operates automatically to facilitate the noncustodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to access the child and to exercise his visitation rights.  In the best of all possible circumstances, Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s limited veto power assures him relatively easy access to A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. so that he may continue a meaningful relationship with his son.  But this power, standing alone, does not transform him into a <em>custodian</em> for purposes of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s return remedy.  Instead, it authorizes him, pursuant to Article 21, to seek assistance from this country in carrying out the Chilean family court\xe2\x80\x99s visitation order.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court recognizes, as it must, that \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98[t]he interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Medell\xc3\xadn, </em>552 U. S., at 506), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is atextual\xe2\x80\x94at least as far as the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text goes.  The Court first relies on the text of the Chilean law at issue and a single Chilean administrator\xe2\x80\x99s alleged interpretation thereof.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  While it is true that the meaning of Chile\xe2\x80\x99s statute matters to our determining whether a parent has taken a child in \xe2\x80\x9cbreach of rights of custody . . . under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 3<em>(a)</em>,<em> </em>Treaty Doc., at 7, it does not and should not inform what the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d means in the first place.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also reminds us that the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s terms are to be broadly construed.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  To be sure, the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s leading interpretive authority informs us that the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d is broad and flexible.  See P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb667, 71, 84, at 446, 447, 451\xe2\x80\x93452.  And we are to apply its terms to \xe2\x80\x9callo[w] the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb667, at 446.  But such breadth should not circumvent the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text in order to sweep a travel restriction under the umbrella of rights of custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A reading as broad and flexible as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s eviscerates the distinction the Convention draws between rights of custody and rights of access.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading essentially voids the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s Article 21, which provides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of access.  If a violation of this type of provision were not a breach of the rights of access, I find it quite difficult to imagine what the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters had in mind when they created a second, lesser remedy for the breach of access rights.  The drafters obviously contemplated that some removals might be in violation of the law of the child\xe2\x80\x99s home nation, but not \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, not in breach of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is precisely why Article 5 carefully delineates between the two types of parental rights in the first place.  And this is precisely why Article 21 exists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the Court has now decreed that whenever an award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default travel restriction provision, or is accompanied by a travel restriction by judicial order, a parent possess a right of custody within the meaning of the Convention.  Such a bright-line rule surely will not serve the best interests of the child in many cases.  See P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb625, at 432.  It will also have surprising results.  In Chile, for example, as a result of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, <em>all parents</em>\xe2\x80\x94so long as they have the barest of visitation rights\xe2\x80\x94now also have joint custody within the meaning of the Convention and the right to utilize the return remedy.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears emphasis that such a result\xe2\x80\x94treating the type of travel restriction at issue in this case as part of \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94will undermine the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s careful balance between the \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody and the \xe2\x80\x9crights of access\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the problems which can arise from a <em>breach of access rights</em>, especially where the child is taken abroad by its custodian, were raised during the Fourteenth Session, the majority view was that <em>such situations could not be put in the same category as the wrongful removals which it is sought to prevent</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis example, and others like it where breach of access rights profoundly upsets the equilibrium established by a judicial or administrative decision, certainly demonstrate that decisions concerning the custody of children should always be open to review.  This problem however defied all efforts the Hague Conference to coordinate views thereon.  <em>A questionable result would have been attained had the application of the Convention, by granting the same degree of protection to custody and access rights, led ultimately to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by those who held the other</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xb665, at 445 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt seems the very same authority on which the Court relies to support its broad, flexible reading of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s terms also tell us that the drafters <em>expressly rejected</em> the very outcome the Court reaches today.  Far from \xe2\x80\x9crender[ing] the Convention meaningless,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9, a faithful reading of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text avoids the very \xe2\x80\x9cquestionable result\xe2\x80\x9d its drafters foresaw and attempted to preclude were they to extend \xe2\x80\x9cthe same degree of protection\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto custody and access rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xc2\xb665, at 445.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, in my view, the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain and that language precludes the result the Court reaches.  See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U. S. 176</a>, 180 (1982).  In these circumstances, the \xe2\x80\x9cclear import of treaty language controls\xe2\x80\x9d the decision.  <em>Ibid.</em>  To support its reading of the text, however, the Court turns to authority we utilize to aid us in interpreting ambiguous treaty text: the position of the Executive Branch and authorities from foreign jurisdictions that have confronted the question before the Court.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  Were I to agree with the Court that it is necessary turn to these sources to resolve the question before us, I would not afford them the weight the Court does in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Views of the Department of State.</em>  Without discussing precisely why, we have afforded \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning given [treaties] by the departments of government particularly charged with their negotiation and enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kolovrat</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/187/index.html">366 U.

We have awarded \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the views of a particular government department even when the views expressed by the department are newly memorialized, see <em>Sumitomo</em>, 457 U. S., at 184, n.\xc2\xa010, and even when the views appear contrary to those expressed by the department at the time of the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s signing and negotiation, <em>ibid.</em>  In this case, it appears that both are true: The Department of State\xe2\x80\x99s position, which supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, is newly memorialized, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21, n.\xc2\xa013, and is possibly inconsistent with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s earlier position, see Convention Analysis 10504\xe2\x80\x9310505.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Putting aside any concerns arising from the fact that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s views are newly memorialized and changing, I would not in this case abdicate our responsibility to interpret the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s language.  This does not seem to be a matter in which deference to the Executive on matters of foreign policy would avoid international conflict, cf. <em>Itel Containers Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em> v. <em>Huddleston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/60/index.html">507 U. S. 60</a>, 76 (1993) (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nuances of foreign policy \xe2\x80\x98are much more the province of the Executive Branch and Congress than of this Court\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Container Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/index.html">463 U.

Nor is this a case in which the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history is particularly rich or illuminating.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  See <em>Factor,</em> 290 U.

Finally, and significantly, the State Department, as the Central Authority for administering the Convention in the United States, has failed to disclose to the Court whether it has facilitated the return of children to America when the shoe is on the other foot.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4, n.\xc2\xa03 (describing responsibilities of the Central Authority).  Thus, we have no informed basis to assess the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s postratification conduct, or the conduct of other signatories, to aid us in understanding the accepted meaning of potentially ambiguous terms.  See <em>Zicherman</em> v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/217/index.html">516 U. S. 217</a>, 227\xe2\x80\x93228 (1996) (considering \xe2\x80\x9cpostratification conduct of the contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Charlton</em> v. <em>Kelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/229/447/index.html">229 U.

Its view is informed by no unique vantage it has, whether as the entity responsible for enforcing the Convention in this country or as a participating drafter.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s perfunctory, one-paragraph treatment of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of this matter only underscores this point.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711601(b)(3)(B)).  This may well be correct, but we should not substitute the judgment of other courts for our own.  See <em>Olympic Airways </em>v. <em>Husain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/644/index.html">540 U. S. 644</a>, 655, n.\xc2\xa09 (2004).  And the handful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, provide insufficient reason to depart from my understanding of the meaning of the Convention, an understanding shared by many U. S. Courts of Appeals.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 542 F. 3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Gutierrez</em>, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to \xe2\x80\x9crefuse permission for his children to leave Mexico\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest sense of the term\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Croll, </em>229 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 140 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were to enforce rights held pursuant to a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>clause by the remedy of mandatory return, the Convention would become unworkable\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  It does not contemplate return of a child to a parent whose sole right\xe2\x80\x94to visit or veto\xe2\x80\x94impose no duty to give care\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Fawcett</em> v. <em>McRoberts</em>, 326 F.\xc2\xa03d 491 (CA4 2003).  Indeed, the interest in having our courts correctly interpret the Convention may outweigh the interest in having the <em>ne exeat</em> clause issue resolved in the same way that it is resolved in other countries.  Cf. <em>Breard</em> v. <em>Greene</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/371/index.html">523 U. S. 371</a>, 375 (1998) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile we should give respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such, it has been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also fail to see the international consensus\xe2\x80\x94let alone the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad acceptance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x94that the Court finds among those varied decisions from foreign courts that have considered the effect of a similar travel restriction within the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme.  The various decisions of the international courts are, at best, in equipoise.  Indeed, the Court recognizes that courts in Canada and France have concluded that travel restrictions are not \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And those decisions supportive of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position do not offer nearly as much support as first meets the eye.  For example, the English High Court of Justice decision on which the Court primarily relies, <em>ante</em>, at 12, appears to have decided a different issue.  True, that court considered the effect of a similar travel restriction on both parents following the award of \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d to the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  <em>C.</em> v. <em>C.</em>, [1989] 1 W.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 654, 656 (C.\xc2\xa0A.).  But the family court had also decreed, at the time it awarded \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d to the mother, that both parents would remain \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98joint guardians\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the child.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Moreover, in the time between the mother\xe2\x80\x99s removal of the child and the father\xe2\x80\x99s petitioning for his return, the father had returned to the Family Court in Sydney, obtained an order for the child\xe2\x80\x99s return, and received immediate custody of the child.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Comparable facts do not exist in this case.  Cf. <em>Olympic Airways</em>, 540 U. S., at 655, n.\xc2\xa09 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are hesitant\xe2\x80\x9d to follow decisions of sister signatory courts when \xe2\x80\x9cthere are substantial factual distinctions between\xe2\x80\x9d the cases).  Similar factual distinctions\xe2\x80\x94involving, typically, joint guardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights\xe2\x80\x94are present in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the Court and Mr. Abbott.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those foreign courts that have reached a position consistent with my own, the Court is right to point out, have also done so in slightly different factual scenarios.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  The Supreme Court of Canada, for example, first encountered a <em>ne exeat</em> provision as part of an interim custody order in <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Thomson</em>, [1994] 3 S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0R. 551, 589\xe2\x80\x93590, 119 D.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. (4th) 253, 281.  Although the Canadian high court concluded that a removal in breach of the temporary travel restriction was wrongful, it emphasized the interim nature of the provision, see n.\xc2\xa09, <em>supra</em>, and explained that the case would be different with a permanent order.  See <em>Thomson</em>, 3 S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0R., at 589, 119 D.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R., at 281 (\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a [permanent] clause raises quite different issues.

The judgment of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters was that breaches of access rights, while significant (and thus expressly protected by Article 21), are secondary to protecting the child\xe2\x80\x99s interest in maintaining an existing custodial relationship. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Court has upended the considered judgment of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters in favor of protecting the rights of noncustodial parents.  In my view, the bright-line rule the Court adopts today is particularly unwise in the context of a treaty intended to govern disputes affecting the welfare of children.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As the Court recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 15, the Executive Branch considers the P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera Report \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98official history\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for the Convention and \xe2\x80\x9ca source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the Convention available to all States becoming parties to it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Legal Analysis of Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 51 Fed.

She violated Chilean law when she took A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A. to Texas because she sought neither Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s permission nor the court\xe2\x80\x99s authorization before doing so.  She violated both the existing \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em>\xe2\x80\x9d order imposed by judicial decree in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s custody dispute, see <em>ante</em>, at 2, as well as Chilean statutory law defining the access rights of noncustodial parents, see Art. 49, Minors Law 16,618, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.  The removal was illegal, then, but it was only wrongful within the meaning of the Convention if it was in breach of Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s rights of custody.  Unfortunately, I fear the Court\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct\xe2\x80\x94even, potentially, at the sake of the best interests of the child\xe2\x80\x94has caused it to minimize this important distinction.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court repeatedly refers to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, as if the single travel restriction at issue in this case were on a par with the multiple rights commonly exercised by custodial parents.  Chile\xe2\x80\x99s statutory <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat </em>provision is better characterized as a restriction on the travel of both the minor and the custodial parent than as a bundle of \xe2\x80\x9crights\xe2\x80\x9d possessed by the noncustodial parent.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo determine\xe2\x80\x9d can also mean, as the Court observes, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to set bounds or limits to,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 711 (2d ed. 1954) (1st definition) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 2d)).  However, this definition of \xe2\x80\x9cto determine\xe2\x80\x9d makes little functional sense as applied to this treaty.  In the context of understanding the meaning of rights of custody, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto determine\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be so indeterminate as to merely set \xe2\x80\x9climits to\xe2\x80\x9d a child\xe2\x80\x99s place of residence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court emphasizes that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cto determine\xe2\x80\x9d on which it relies is the first such entry in Webster\xe2\x80\x99s, <em>ante</em>, at 7, it is worth noting that surely the Court would not rely on the first such definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d in that source (\xe2\x80\x9csuffering of mind; grief; sorrow\xe2\x80\x9d) to understand the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s use of that word.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 2d, at 405.  Instead, the fifth definition of that word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccharge, supervision, management\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is clearly the relevant one.  The point is only that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting among possible definitions.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cResidence\xe2\x80\x9d can also refer to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he place where a corporation or other enterprise does business or is registered to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1423.

Unlike in this case, in which a Chilean court has already decreed Ms. Abbott to be A.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s sole custodian, in <em>Villegas Duran </em>v. <em>Beaumont</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cno Judge of the Republic of Chile has granted the custody of the child to her mother \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region Metropolitana to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in <em>Villegas Duran</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2008, No. 08\xe2\x80\x93775, p. 36a.  In other words, Ms. Camus\xe2\x80\x99 letter request for the child\xe2\x80\x99s return in that case depends on a provision of Article 49 not at issue in this case: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the custody of a legitimate child has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a third party, the child may not leave without authorization of both parents.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.  The travel restriction that bound Ms. Abbott in this case, however, arose \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce the court . . . decreed the obligation to allow visits\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Abbott.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although not before us, there may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and significance of a travel restriction in effect <em>prior to </em>an award of custody to either or both parents, from one that occurs ancillary to the award of visitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights.  Moreover, the U. S. Department of State, at the time the Convention was ratified, believed that the Convention would require return in these circumstances: \xe2\x80\x9cChildren who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the entry of a custody order are protected by the Convention.  There need not be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s return provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention Analysis 10505.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In 2003, the latest year for which statistics appear available, Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Central Authority, which is the entity responsible for administering its obligations under the Hague Convention, made five outgoing \xe2\x80\x9caccess applications\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 21.

Were the Court correct\xe2\x80\x94and were the view the Court ascribes to Chile\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own law also correct, see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x94all of Chile\xe2\x80\x99s outgoing applications under the Convention almost certainly should have been \xe2\x80\x9creturn applications\xe2\x80\x9d because any person with rights of access under Chilean law, also has a right of custody by virtue of the statutory<em> ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> provision.  It is plain that even Chilean officials have not thought correct the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the intersection of the travel restriction in Article 49 of its Minors Law 16,618 and the Convention.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See Art. 32, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 331, 340 (\xe2\x80\x9cRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation \xe2\x80\xa6 when the interpretation \xe2\x80\xa6 (<em>a</em>) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (<em>b</em>) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The State Department explained to the Senate at the time it sought ratification of the Convention that the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental purpose of the Hague Convention\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto protect children from wrongful international removals or retentions by persons bent on obtaining their physical and/or legal custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention Analysis 10504.  I find it quite unlikely, in light of its framing of the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the Convention, that the State Department would have agreed at the time that a removal was \xe2\x80\x9cwrongful\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Convention when a parent <em>with physical custody</em> of a child took that child to another country, even when that removal was in violation of a restriction on the custodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s travel rights.  See also Brief for Eleven Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x935, n.\xc2\xa07.  Even more telling, however, is the fact that, in a response to a questionnaire used by the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters in preparing the treaty, the United States characterized a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> right as one with \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of preserving the jurisdiction of the state in the custody matter and of safeguarding the visitation rights of the other parent.\xe2\x80\x9d  1980 Conf\xc3\xa9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\xc3\xa9, Enl\xc3\xa8vement d\xe2\x80\x99enfants, Replies of the Governments to the Questionnaire, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\xc3\xa8me session, pp. 85, 88 (1982).  Such a description is inconsistent with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s current position that a <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> clause is a freestanding right of custody within the meaning of the Convention.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This only underscores what seems quite clear: Whatever contemporary international consensus the Court claims has now emerged, \xe2\x80\x9cthat view was not generally formulated when the Convention was drafted in 1980.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  I understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to contemporary consensus to depend on the views of contemporary scholars and individual signatory states developed postratification, including the views of the Special Commission, a voluntary <em>post hac </em>collective body with no treaty-making authority, see <em>ibid.</em>  Even assuming that the Court is correct that consensus has emerged after the Convention was written and ratified that <em>ne\xc2\xa0exeat</em> rights <em>should </em>be \xe2\x80\x9crights of custody,\xe2\x80\x9d in my view this provides no support at all for the position that the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafters had these types of rights in mind and intended for the Convention to treat them as rights of custody.
