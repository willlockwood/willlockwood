V. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. <em>v</em>. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC., dba CONAGRA REFRIGERATED FOODS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93597.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 2, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 23, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">After respondent ConAgra warned companies selling equipment and processes for browning precooked meats that it intended to protect its rights under its patent for that process, petitioner Unitherm, whose president had invented the process six years before ConAgra filed its patent application, and one of ConAgra\xe2\x80\x99s direct competitors jointly filed suit in an Oklahoma federal court.  As relevant here, they sought a declaration that ConAgra\xe2\x80\x99s patent was invalid and unenforceable and alleged that ConAgra had violated \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act by attempting to enforce a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office, see <em>Walker Process Equipment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/172/index.html">382 U. S. 172</a>, 174.  The District Court found the patent invalid and allowed the <em>Walker Process </em>claim to proceed to trial.  Before the case was submitted to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence.  The court denied the motion, the jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.  On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the <em>Walker Process</em> verdict.  The court applied Tenth Circuit law, under which a party that has failed to file a postverdict sufficiency of the evidence challenge may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as the party filed a Rule 50(a) motion before submission of the case to the jury.  The only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.  Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment and ordered a new trial. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b), the Federal Circuit had no basis for reviewing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency of the evidence challenge.  Rule 50 sets forth the requirements, establishing two stages, for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial.  Rule 50(a) allows a challenge prior to the case\xe2\x80\x99s submission to the jury, authorizing the district court to grant the motion at the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the requirements for renewing the challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.  A party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a Rule 50(b) postverdict motion deprives an appellate court of the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/212/index.html">330 U. S. 212</a>, 218.  It also deprives an appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, <em>Globe Liquor Co.</em> v. <em>San Roman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/571/index.html">332 U. S. 571</a>, and where the district court expressly reserved a party\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict directed verdict motion and then denied it after the verdict, <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/48/index.html">344 U. S. 48</a>.  A postverdict motion is necessary because determining \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 216.  Moreover, the requirement \xe2\x80\x9cis not an idle motion\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9can essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 53.  These authorities require reversal of the judgment below.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s observations about the postverdict motion\xe2\x80\x99s necessity and the benefits of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s input at that stage apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial.  Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the <em>Cone, Globe Liquor,</em> and <em>Johnson</em> outcomes underscore this holding.  Those litigants all secured new trials, but they had moved for a new trial postverdict in the district court and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a new trial based solely on a denied Rule 50(a) motion.  This result is further validated by the purported basis of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, namely the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of its Rule 50(a) motion.  <em>Cone, Globe Liquor,</em> and <em>Johnson</em> unequivocally establish that the precise subject matter of a party\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 50(a) motion cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b).  Respondent, rather than seeking to appeal the claim raised in its Rule 50(a) motion, seeks a <em>new trial</em> based on legal insufficiency of the evidence.  If a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from seeking the relief sought in its Rule 50(a) motion, then surely respondent is foreclosed from seeking relief it did not and could not seek in its preverdict motion.  Rule 50(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text confirms that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 50(a) motion did not give the District Court the option of ordering a new trial, for it provides that a district court may only order a new trial based on issues raised in a Rule 50(a) motion when \xe2\x80\x9cruling on a renewed motion\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 50(b).  If the District Court lacked such power, then the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless.  Rule 50(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text and application also support this result.  A district court may enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, but it is not required to do so.  Thus, the denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 50(a) motion was not error, but merely an exercise of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.

In this case, however, the respondent filed a Rule 50(a) motion before the verdict, but did not file a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict.  Nor did respondent request a new trial under Rule 59.  The Court of Appeals nevertheless proceeded to review the sufficiency of the evidence and, upon a finding that the evidence was insufficient, remanded the case for a new trial.  Because our cases addressing the requirements of Rule 50 compel a contrary result, we reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was ConAgra\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to enforce its patent for \xe2\x80\x9cA Method for Browning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat Products,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Patent No. 5,952,027 (\xe2\x80\x99027 patent).  In early 2000, ConAgra issued a general warning to companies who sold equipment and processes for browning precooked meats explaining that it intended to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98aggressively protect all of [its] rights under [the \xe2\x80\x99027] patent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  375 F.\xc2\xa03d 1341, 1344 (CA Fed. 2004).  Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes, but did not receive ConAgra\xe2\x80\x99s warning.  ConAgra also contacted its direct competitors in the precooked meat business, announcing that it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98making the \xe2\x80\x99027 Patent and corresponding patents that may issue available for license at a royalty rate of 10\xcb\x98 per pound.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1345.  Jennie-O, a direct competitor, received ConAgra\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence and undertook an investigation to determine its rights and responsibilities with regard to the \xe2\x80\x99027 patent.  Jennie-O determined that the browning process it had purchased from Unitherm was the same as the process described in the \xe2\x80\x99027 patent.  Jennie-O further determined that the \xe2\x80\x99027 patent was invalid because Unitherm\xe2\x80\x99s president had invented the process described in that patent six years before ConAgra filed its patent application.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with these determinations, Jennie-O and Unitherm jointly sued ConAgra in the Western District of Oklahoma.  As relevant here, Jennie-O and Unitherm sought a declaration that the \xe2\x80\x99027 patent was invalid and unenforceable, and alleged that ConAgra had violated \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72, by attempting to enforce a patent that was obtained by committing fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).  See<em> Walker Process Equipment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/172/index.html">382 U. S. 172</a>, 174 (1965) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be violative of \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act provided the other elements necessary to a \xc2\xa72 case are present\xe2\x80\x9d).  The District Court construed the \xe2\x80\x99027 patent and determined that it was invalid based on Unitherm\xe2\x80\x99s prior public use and sale of the process described therein.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(b).  After dismissing Jennie-O for lack of antitrust standing, the District Court allowed Unitherm\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Walker Process </em>claim to proceed to trial.  Prior to the court\xe2\x80\x99s submission of the case to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence.  The District Court denied that motion.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Walker Process </em>verdict.  Although the Federal Circuit has concluded that a party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to present the district court with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Biodex Corp.</em> v. <em>Loredan Biomedical, Inc.</em>, 946 F.\xc2\xa02d 850, 862 (1991), in the instant case it was bound to apply the law of the Tenth Circuit.  375 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1365, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9cOn most issues related to Rule 50 motions \xe2\x80\xa6 we generally apply regional circuit law unless the precise issue being appealed pertains uniquely to patent law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to file a postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury.  <em>Cummings</em> v. <em>General Motors Corp</em>., 365 F.\xc2\xa03d 944, 950\xe2\x80\x93951 (2004).  Notably, the only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.  <em>Id</em>., at 951.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit concluded that, although Unitherm had presented sufficient evidence to support a determination that ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it had obtained through fraud on the PTO, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1362, Unitherm had failed to present evidence sufficient to support the remaining elements of its antitrust claim.  <em>Id</em>., at 1365 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnitherm failed to present any economic evidence capable of sustaining its asserted relevant antitrust market, and little to support any other aspect of its Section 2 claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, it vacated the jury\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial.  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1186/index.html">543 U. S. 1186</a> (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges\xe2\x80\x94prior to submission of the case to the jury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment.  Rule 50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the District Court to grant such motions at the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) Motions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury.  Such a motion shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nRule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) Renewing Motion for Judgment After Trial; Alternative Motion for New Trial.  If, for any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion.  The movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than 10 days after entry of judgment\xe2\x80\x94and may alternatively request a new trial or join a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.  In ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) if a verdict was returned:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) allow the judgment to stand,</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) order a new trial, or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of</p>\n<p>\n\nlaw \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has addressed the implications of a party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts.  This Court has concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the absence of such a motion\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cappellate court [is] without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/212/index.html">330 U. S. 212</a>, 218 (1947).  This Court has similarly concluded that a party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprives the appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, <em>Globe Liquor Co.</em> v. <em>San Roman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/571/index.html"></a><a href="/us/332/571/index.html">332 U. S. 571</a> (1948), and where the district court expressly reserved a party\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict motion for a directed verdict and then denied that motion after the verdict was returned.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>New York, N.\xc2\xa0H. &amp; H.\xc2\xa0R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/48/index.html">344 U. S. 48</a> (1952).  A postverdict motion is necessary because \xe2\x80\x9c[d]etermination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Cone</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 216.  Moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9crequirement of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\xa6 an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 53.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judgment below.  Respondent correctly points out that these authorities address whether an appellate court may enter judgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as opposed to whether an appellate court may order a new trial (as the Federal Circuit did here).  But this distinction is immaterial.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s observations about the necessity of a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s input at that stage, apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial.  In <em>Cone</em>,<em> </em>this Court concluded that, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to exercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new trial and entering judgment, its \xe2\x80\x9cappraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a <em>new trial</em> should be granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  330 U. S., at 216 (emphasis added).  Similarly, this Court has determined that a party may only pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief available under Rule 50(b), namely the entry of judgment <em>or a new trial</em>, when that party has complied with the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s filing requirements by requesting that particular relief below.  See<em> Johnson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 54 (\xe2\x80\x9cRespondent made a motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial within the time required by Rule 50(b).  It failed to comply with permission given by 50(b) to move for judgment <em>n.\xc2\xa0o.\xc2\xa0v.</em> after the verdict.  In this situation respondent is entitled only to a new trial, not to a judgment in its favor\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the straightforward language employed in <em>Cone</em>, <em>Globe Liquor</em>, and <em>Johnson, </em>respondent maintains that those cases dictate affirmance here, because in each of those cases the litigants secured a new trial.  But in each of those cases the appellants moved for a new trial postverdict in the District Court, and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a new trial solely on the basis of a denied Rule 50(a) motion.  See<em> Cone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 213 (noting that respondent moved for a new trial);[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] <em>Globe Liquor</em>, 332 U. S., at 572 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe respondents \xe2\x80\xa6 moved for a new trial on the ground \xe2\x80\xa6 that there were many contested issues of fact\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, <em>Johnson </em>concluded that respondent was <em>only</em> entitled to a new trial by virtue of its motion for such \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the time required by Rule 50(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  344 U. S., at 54.  Accordingly, these outcomes merely underscore our holding today\xe2\x80\x94a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our determination that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with Rule 50(b) forecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is further validated by the purported basis of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, namely the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict Rule 50(a) motion.  As an initial matter, <em>Cone</em>, <em>Globe Liquor</em>, and <em>Johnson</em> unequivocally establish that the precise subject matter of a party\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 50(a) motion\xe2\x80\x94namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law\xe2\x80\x94cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b).  Here, respondent does not seek to pursue on appeal the precise claim it raised in its Rule 50(a) motion before the District Court\xe2\x80\x94namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.  Rather, it seeks a <em>new trial</em> based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence.  But if, as in <em>Cone, Globe Liquor</em>, and <em>Johnson</em>, a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from seeking the relief it sought in its Rule 50(a) motion\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the entry of judgment\xe2\x80\x94then surely respondent is foreclosed from seeking a new trial, relief it did not and could not seek in its preverdict motion.  In short, respondent never sought a new trial before the District Court, and thus forfeited its right to do so on appeal.  <em>Yakus</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/index.html">321 U. S. 414</a>, 444 (1944) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a \xe2\x80\xa6 right may be forfeited \xe2\x80\xa6 by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of Rule 50(b) confirms that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict Rule 50(a) motion did not present the District Court with the option of ordering a new trial.  That text provides that a district court may only order a new trial on the basis of issues raised in a preverdict Rule 50(a) motion when \xe2\x80\x9cruling on a renewed motion\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 50(b).  Accordingly, even if the District Court was inclined to grant a new trial on the basis of arguments raised in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict motion, it was without the power to do so under Rule 50(b) absent a postverdict motion pursuant to that Rule.  Consequently, the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the text and application of Rule 50(a) support our determination that respondent may not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of its Rule 50(a) motion.  The Rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court <em>may</em> determine\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on [a given] issue,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>may</em> grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  Thus, while a district court is permitted to enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, it is not required to do so.  To the contrary, the district courts are, if anything, encouraged to submit the case to the jury, rather than granting such motions.  As Wright and Miller explain:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEven at the close of all the evidence it may be desirable to refrain from granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law despite the fact that it would be possible for the district court to do so.  If judgment as a matter of law is granted and the appellate court holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to the jury, an entire new trial must be had.  If, on the other hand, the trial court submits the case to the jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final determination of the case is expedited greatly.  If the jury agrees with the court\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end.  If the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Then if the appellate court holds that the trial court was in error in is appraisal of the evidence, it can reverse and order judgment on the verdict of the jury, without any need for a new trial.  For this reason the appellate courts repeatedly have said that it usually is desirable to take a verdict, and then pass on the sufficiency of the evidence on a post-verdict motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  9A Federal Practice \xc2\xa72533, at 319 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preverdict motion cannot form the basis of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, because the denial of that motion was not error.  It was merely an exercise of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, in accordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence.  The only error here was counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a postverdict motion pursuant to Rule 50(b).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we hold that since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b), there was no basis for review of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals.

In those cases this Court determined that an appellate court may, in certain circumstances, direct the entry of judgment when it reverses the district court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a Rule 50(b) motion.  But in such circumstances the district court will have had an opportunity to consider the propriety of entering judgment or ordering a new trial by virtue of the postverdict motion.

Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>Neely</em> confirms that the broad grant of authority to the Courts of Appeals in \xc2\xa72106 must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach is not only foreclosed by authority of this Court, it also may present Seventh Amendment concerns.  The implication of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72106 is that a court of appeals would be free to examine the sufficiency of the evidence regardless of whether the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion in the district court and, in the event the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion, regardless of whether the district court had ever <em>ruled</em> on that motion.  The former is squarely foreclosed by <em>Slocum</em> v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/228/364/index.html">228 U. S. 364</a> (1913), and the latter is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the requirements of the Seventh Amendment in <em>Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc.</em> v. <em>Redman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/654/index.html">295 U.

Indeed, Rule 50 was drafted with such concerns in mind.  See 9A C. Wright &amp; A.

This is not a case, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule.  The spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation of a court\xe2\x80\x99s power to avoid manifestly unjust results in exceptional cases.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>New York, N.

The majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding is inconsistent with a statute enacted just months after <em>Globe Liquor</em> was decided.  That statute, which remains in effect today, provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  It is well settled that a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver or forfeiture of an argument does not, in the absence of a contrary statutory command, preclude the courts of appeals from considering those arguments.  See <em>Singleton</em> v. <em>Wulff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/index.html">428 U. S. 106</a>, 121 (1976).

S., at 216, it may be unfair or even an abuse of discretion for a court of appeals to direct a verdict in favor of the party that lost below if that party failed to make a timely Rule 50(b) motion.  Likewise, it may not be \xe2\x80\x9cjust under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d for a court of appeals to order a new trial in the absence of a proper Rule 59 motion.  Finally, a court of appeals has discretion to rebuff, on grounds of waiver or forfeiture, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence absent a proper Rule 50(b) or Rule 59 motion made in the district court.  None of the foregoing propositions rests, however, on a determination that the courts of appeals lack \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d to review the sufficiency of the evidence and order appropriate relief under these circumstances, and I can divine no basis for that determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that the Seventh Amendment limits appellate courts\xe2\x80\x99 power to review judgments under 28 U.

First, although the right to trial by jury might be implicated if no Rule 50(a) motion had been made, such a motion <em>was</em> made in this case.  The Rule 50(a) motion triggered the automatic reservation of \xe2\x80\x9clegal questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ.
