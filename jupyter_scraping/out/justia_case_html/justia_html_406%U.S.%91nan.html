JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a motion by Illinois to file a bill of complaint under our original jurisdiction against four cities of Wisconsin, the Sewerage Commission of the City of Milwaukee, and the Metropolitan Sewerage Commission of the County of Milwaukee.  The cause of action alleged is pollution by the defendants of Lake Michigan, a body of interstate water.  According to plaintiff, some 200 million gallons of raw or inadequately treated sewage and other waste materials are discharged daily into the lake in the Milwaukee area alone.  Plaintiff alleges that it and its subdivisions prohibit and prevent such discharges, but that the defendants do not take such actions.  Plaintiff asks that we abate this public nuisance.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides:  "In all Cases . . . in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction."  Congress has provided in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251 that "(a) the Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of:  (1) All controversies between two or more States."</p>\n<p>It has long been this Court\'s philosophy that "our original jurisdiction should be invoked sparingly."  <em>Utah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/89/case.html">394 U. S. 89</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/89/case.html#95">394 U. S. 95</a></span>.  We construe 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251(a)(1), a we do Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to make it obligatory only in appropriate cases.  And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet, beyond that, it necessarily involves the availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief may be had.  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 406 U. S. 94</a></p><p> incline to a sparing use of our original jurisdiction so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not suffer.  <em>Washington v. General Motors Corp., post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/109/case.html">406 U. S. 109</a></span>.  Illinois presses its request for leave to file, saying that the agencies named as defendants are instrumentalities of Wisconsin, and therefore that this is a suit against Wisconsin which could not be brought in any other forum.  Under our decisions, there is no doubt that the actions of public entities might, under appropriate pleadings, be attributed to a State so as to warrant a joinder of the State as party defendant.  In <em>Missouri v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/180/208/case.html">180 U. S. 208</a></span>, Missouri invoked our original jurisdiction by an action against the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of the City of Chicago, seeking an injunction to restrain the discharge of raw sewage into the Mississippi River.  On a demurrer to the motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, Illinois argued that the Sanitary District was the proper defendant, and that Illinois should not have been made a party.  That argument was rejected:</p>\n<p>"The contention . . . seems to be that, because the matters complained of in the bill proceed and will continue to proceed from the acts of the Sanitary District of Chicago, a corporation of the State of Illinois, it therefore follows that the State, as such, is not interested in the question, and is improperly made a party."</p>\n<p>"We are unable to see the force of this suggestion.  The bill does not allege that the Sanitary District is acting without or in excess of lawful authority.  The averment and the conceded facts are that the corporation is an agency of the State to do the very things which, according to the theory of the complainant\'s case, will result in the mischief to be apprehended.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 406 U. S. 95</a></p><p> It is state action and its results that are complained of -- thus distinguishing this case from that of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/176/1/case.html">Louisiana v. Texas</a></span></em> [176 U.S. 1], where the acts sought to be restrained were alleged to be those of officers or functionaries proceeding in a wrongful and malevolent misapplication of the quarantine laws of Texas.  The Sanitary District of Chicago is not a private corporation, formed for purposes of private gain, but a public corporation, whose existence and operations are wholly within the control of the State."</p>\n<p>"The object of the bill is to subject this public work to judicial supervision, upon the allegation that the method of its construction and maintenance will create a continuing nuisance, dangerous to the health of a neighboring State and its inhabitants.  Surely, in such a case, the State of Illinois would have a right to appear and traverse the allegations of the bill, and, having such a right, might properly be made a party defendant."</p>\n<p>180 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/180/208/case.html#242">180 U. S. 242</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>New York v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/296/case.html">256 U. S. 296</a></span>, the State of New York brought an original action against the State of New Jersey and the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, seeking an injunction against the discharge of sewage into Upper New York Bay.  The question was whether the actions of the sewage agency could be attributed to New Jersey so as to make that State responsible for them.  The Court said:</p>\n<p>"Also, for the purpose of showing the responsibility of the State of New Jersey for the proposed action of the defendant, the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, the bill sets out, with much detail, the acts of the legislature of that State authorizing and directing such action on their part. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 406 U. S. 96</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"Of this, it is sufficient to say that the averments of the bill, quite undenied, show that the defendant sewerage commissioners constitute such a statutory, corporate agency of the State that their action, actual or intended, must be treated as that of the State itself, and we shall so regard it."</p>\n<p>256 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/296/case.html#302">256 U.

The action was originally brought by the State of New Jersey against the City and State of New York for injunctive relief against the diversion of waters from Delaware River tributaries lying within New York State.  Pennsylvania was subsequently allowed to intervene.  The question presented by this decision was the right of the City of Philadelphia also to intervene in the proceedings as a party plaintiff.  The issues raised were broad:</p>\n<p>"All of the present parties to the litigation have formally opposed the motion to intervene on grounds (1) that the intervention would permit a suit against a state by a citizen of another state in contravention of the Eleventh Amendment; (2) that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the exclusive right to represent the interest of Philadelphia as <em>parens patriae;</em> and (3) that intervention should be denied, in any event, as a matter of sound discretion."</p>\n<p>345 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/369/case.html#372">345 U. S. 372</a></span>.  We denied the City of Philadelphia\'s motion to intervene, saying:</p>\n<p>"The City of Philadelphia represents only a part of the citizens of Pennsylvania who reside in the watershed area of the Delaware River and its tributaries and depend upon those water.  If we undertook to evaluate all the separate interests within Pennsylvania, we could, in effect, be drawn into an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 406 U. S. 97</a></p><p> intramural dispute over the distribution of water within the Commonwealth. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Our original jurisdiction should not be thus expanded to the dimensions of ordinary class actions.  An intervenor whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state."</p>\n<p>345 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/369/case.html#373">345 U. S. 373</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We added:</p>\n<p>"The presence of New York City in this litigation is urged as a reason for permitting Philadelphia to intervene.  But the argument misconstrues New York City\'s position in the case.  New York City was not admitted into this litigation as a matter of discretion at her request.  She was forcibly joined as a defendant to the original action since she was the authorized agent for the execution of the sovereign policy which threatened injury to the citizens of New Jersey.  Because of this position as a defendant, subordinate to the parent state as the primary defendant, New York City\'s position in the case raises no problems under the Eleventh Amendment."</p>\n<p>345 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/369/case.html#374">345 U. S. 374</a></span>-375.</p>\n<p>We conclude that, while, under appropriate pleadings, Wisconsin could be joined as a defendant in the present controversy, it is not mandatory that it be made one.</p>\n<p>It is well settled that, for the purposes of diversity of citizenship, political subdivisions are citizens of their respective States. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Bullard v. City of Cisco,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/179/case.html">290 U. S. 179</a></span>; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 406 U. S. 98</a></p><p> <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/118/case.html">Cowles v. Mercer County,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 118,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/122/case.html">74 U. S. 122</a></span>.  If a political subdivision is a citizen for diversity purposes, then it would make no jurisdictional difference whether it was the plaintiff or defendant in such an action.  That being the case, a political subdivision in one State would be able to bring an action founded upon diversity jurisdiction against a political subdivision of another State.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that the term "States," as used in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251(a)(1), should not be read to include their political subdivisions.  That, of course, does not mean that political subdivisions of a State may not be sued under the head of our original jurisdiction, for 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251 provides that</p>\n<p>"(b) the Supreme Court shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of:  . . . (3) all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State. . . ."</p>\n<p>If the named public entities of Wisconsin may, however, be sued by Illinois in a federal district court, our original jurisdiction is not mandatory.</p>\n<p>It is to that aspect of the case that we now turn.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(a) provides that</p>\n<p>"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>The considerable interests involved in the purity of interstate waters would seem to put beyond question the jurisdictional amount provided in \xc2\xa7 1331(a).  <em>See Glenwood Light &amp; Water Co. v.

In another context, that of state law, this Court has recognized that the statutory word \'laws\' includes court decisions.

In 1899, it established some surveillance by the Army Corps of Engineers over industrial pollution, not including sewage, Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1121, a grant of power which we construed in <em>United States v.

Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/224/case.html">384 U. S. 224</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The 1899 Act has been reinforced and broadened by a complex of laws recently enacted.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 62 Stat. 1155, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1151, tightens control over discharges into navigable waters so as not to lower applicable water quality standards.  By the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 862, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4321 <em>et seq.,</em> Congress "authorizes and directs" that</p>\n<p>"the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act,"</p>\n<p>and that</p>\n<p>"all agencies of the Federal Government shall . . . identify and develop methods and procedures . . . which will insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 406 U.

Congress has evinced increasing concern with the quality of the aquatic environment as it affects the conservation and safeguarding of fish and wildlife resources.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 1119, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742a; the Act of Sept. 22, 159, 73 Stat. 642, authorizing research in migratory marine game fish, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 760e; and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 48 Stat. 401, as amended, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 661.</p>\n<p>Buttressed by these new and expanding policies, the Corps of Engineers has issued new Rules and Regulations governing permits for discharges or deposits into navigable waters.  36 Fed.Reg. 6564 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, in \xc2\xa7 1(b), declares that it is federal policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States in preventing and controlling water pollution."  But the Act makes clear that it is federal, not state, law that, in the end, controls the pollution of interstate or navigable waters. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  While the States are given time to establish water quality standards, \xc2\xa7 10(c)(1), if a State fails to do so, the federal administrator [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] promulgates one.  \xc2\xa7 10(c)(2).  Section 10(a) makes pollution of interstate or navigable waters subject "to abatement" when it "endangers the health or welfare of any persons."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 406 U. S. 103</a></p><p> The abatement that is authorized follows a long drawn-out procedure unnecessary to relate here.  It uses the conference procedure, hoping for amicable settlements.  But if none is reached, the federal administrator may request the Attorney General to bring suit on behalf of the United States for abatement of the pollution.  \xc2\xa7 10(g).</p>\n<p>The remedy sought by Illinois is not within the precise scope of remedies prescribed by Congress.  Yet the remedies which Congress provides are not necessarily the only federal remedies available.  "It is not uncommon for federal courts to fashion federal law where federal rights are concerned."  <em>Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html">353 U.

When we deal with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a federal common law, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] as <em>Texas v.

Congress provided in \xc2\xa7 10(b) of that Act that, save as a court may decree otherwise in an enforcement action,</p>\n<p>"[s]tate and interstate action to abate pollution of interstate or navigable waters shall be encouraged and shall not . . . be displaced by Federal enforcement action."</p>\n<p>The leading air case is <em>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/case.html">206 U.

The Court said:</p>\n<p>"The caution with which demands of this sort, on the part of a State, for relief from injuries analogous to torts, must be examined, is dwelt upon in <em>Missouri v.

But it is plain that some such demands must be recognized, if the grounds alleged are proved.  When the States, by their union, made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done.  They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining <em>quasi</em>-sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit in this court.  <em>Missouri v.

Some will lack express statutory sanction, but will be solved by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that will effectuate that policy.

S. 334</a></span>), a State that causes a public nuisance is suable in this Court and any of its public entities is suable in a federal district court having jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is generally held that a municipality, like a private individual, may be enjoined from maintaining a nuisance.  Thus, in a proper case, a municipal corporation will be restrained by injunction from creating a nuisance on private property, as by the discharge of sewage or poisonous gases thereon, or, in some jurisdictions, by the obstruction of drainage of waters, or by discharging sewage or filth into a stream and polluting the water to the damage of lower riparian owners, or by dumping garbage or refuse, or by other acts.  Likewise, a municipality may be enjoined from creating or operating a nuisance, whether the municipality is acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, impairing property rights.  And, if a nuisance is established causing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law, it may be enjoined irrespective of the resulting damage or injury to the municipality."</p>\n<p>17 McQuillin, <em>supra,</em> \xc2\xa7 49.55.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
