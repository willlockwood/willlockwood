Section \xc2\xa72680(h), in turn, contains a proviso that extends the waiver of immunity to claims for six intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the \xe2\x80\x9cacts or omissions\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., a federal officer \xe2\x80\x9cwho is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner Millbrook, a federal prisoner, sued the United States under the FTCA, alleging, inter alia, assault and battery by correctional officers.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, and the Third Circuit affirmed, hewing to its precedent that the \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement proviso\xe2\x80\x9d applies only to tortious conduct that occurs during the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The law enforcement proviso extends to law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x99 acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.  The proviso\xe2\x80\x99s plain language supports this conclusion.  On its face, the proviso applies where a claim arises out of one of six intentional torts and is related to the \xe2\x80\x9cacts or omissions\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(h).  And by cross-referencing \xc2\xa71346(b), the proviso incorporates an additional requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cacts or omissions\xe2\x80\x9d occur while the officer is \xe2\x80\x9cacting within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  Nothing in \xc2\xa72680(h)\xe2\x80\x99s text supports further limiting the proviso to conduct arising out of searches, seizures of evidence, or arrests.  The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s only reference to those terms is in \xc2\xa72680(h)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law enforcement officer,\xe2\x80\x9d which focuses on the status of persons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that may give rise to a claim.  This confirms that Congress intended immunity determinations to depend on a federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s legal author-ity, not on a particular exercise of that authority.  Nor does the pro-viso indicate that a waiver of immunity requires the officer to be engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity.  The text never uses those terms.  Had Congress intended to further narrow the waiver\xe2\x80\x99s scope, it could have used language to that effect.  See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214\n.

The District Court dismissed Millbrook\xe2\x80\x99s action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Court of Appeals held that, while the FTCA waives the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity for certain intentional torts by law enforcement officers, it only does so when the tortious conduct occurs in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.

United States, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).

In his complaint, Millbrook alleged that, on March 5, 2010, he was forced to per- form oral sex on a BOP correctional officer, while another officer held him in a choke hold and a third officer stood watch nearby.

The Government contended that \xc2\xa72680(h)\xe2\x80\x99s law enforcement proviso did not save Millbrook\xe2\x80\x99s claims because of the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s binding precedent in Pooler v.

The Ninth Circuit, for instance, held that the law enforcement proviso does not apply unless the tort was \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted in the course of investigative or law enforcement activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Orsay, supra, at 1135.  As noted, the Third Circuit construed the law enforcement proviso even more narrowly in holding that it applies only to tortious conduct by federal officers during the course of \xe2\x80\x9cexecuting a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pooler, 787 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 872.  Court-appointed amicus curiae (Amicus) similarly asks us to construe the proviso to waive \xe2\x80\x9csovereign immunity only for torts committed by federal officers acting in their capacity as \xe2\x80\x98investigative or law enforcement officers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Amicus 5.  Under this approach, the conduct of federal officers would be actionable only when it \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] out of searches, seizures of evidence, arrests, and closely related exercises of investigative or law-enforcement authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of these interpretations finds any support in the text of the statute.  The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s only reference to \xe2\x80\x9csearches,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseiz[ures of] evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9carrests\xe2\x80\x9d is found in the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(h) (defining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98investigative or law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to mean any federal officer who is \xe2\x80\x9cempowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d).  By its terms, this provision focuses on the status of persons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that may give rise to a tort claim against the United States.  The proviso thus distinguishes between the acts for which immunity is waived (e.g., assault and battery), and the class of persons whose acts may give rise to an actionable FTCA claim.  The plain text confirms that Congress intended immunity determinations to depend on a federal officer\xe2\x80\x99s legal authority, not on a particular exercise of that authority.  Consequently, there is no basis for concluding that a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99s intentional tort must oc- cur in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest in order to subject the United States to liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does the text of the proviso provide any indication that the officer must be engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law enforcement activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, the text never uses the term.  Amicus contends that we should read the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or law-enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d as implicitly limiting the proviso to claims arising from actions taken in an officer\xe2\x80\x99s investigative or law enforcement capacity.  But there is no basis for so limiting the term when Congress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct may expose the United States to tort liability.  Under the proviso, an intentional tort is not actionable unless it occurs while the law enforcement officer is \xe2\x80\x9cacting within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(h), 1346(b)(1).  Had Congress intended to further narrow the scope of the proviso, Congress could have limited it to claims arising from \xe2\x80\x9cacts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers acting in a law enforcement or investigative capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214, \n227 (2008)\n.  Congress adopted similar limitations in neighboring provisions, see \xc2\xa72680(a) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the execution of a statute or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)), but did not do so here.
