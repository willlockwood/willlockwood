An employer who violates the notice provisions is liable for penalties by way of a civil action that may be brought "in any district court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer transacts business." \xc2\xa7 2104(a)(5). The class of plaintiffs includes aggrieved employees (or their unions, as representatives), <i>ibid., </i>who may collect "back pay for each day of violation," \xc2\xa7 2104(a)(1)(A), "up to a maximum of 60 days," \xc2\xa7 2104(a)(1).

Crown Cork moved for summary judgment, claiming that the statute of limitations had run. The District Court denied the motion, holding the source of the limitations period for WARN suits to be Pennsylvania state law and the union\'s suit timely under any of the arguably applicable state statutes. 833 F. Supp. 467 (ED Pa. 1993). The District Court nevertheless certified the question of the limitations period for immediate interlocutory appeal under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1292.</p><p>The <i>North Star </i>respondents are former, nonunion employees of petitioner North Star Steel Company who filed a WARN claim against the company (also in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania) alleging that the company laid off 270 workers at a Pennsylvania plant without giving the 60-day advance notice. Like Crown Cork, and for like reasons, North Star also moved for summary judgment. But North Star was successful, the District Court holding the suit barred under the 6-month limitations period for unfair labor practice claims borrowed from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 160(b), a statute believed by the court to be "more analogous" to WARN than anything in state law. 838 F. Supp. 970, 974 (MD Pa. 1993).</p><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit consolidated the cases and held that a period of limitations for WARN should be borrowed from state, not federal, law, reversing in <i>North Star </i>and affirming in <i>Crown Cork. 32 </i>F. 3d 53 (1994).

See, <i>e. g., Reed </i>v. <i>Transportation Union, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/319/case.html">488 U. S. 319</a> (1989) (claims under \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 522, 29 U. S.

S. 151</a> (1983) (hybrid suit by employee against employer for breach of a collective-bargaining agreement and against union for breach of a duty of fair representation governed by NLRA limitations period). Although these examples show borrowing from federal law as well as state, our practice has left no</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="34">34</a></p><p>doubt about the lender of first resort. Since 1830, "state statutes have repeatedly supplied the periods of limitations for federal causes of action" when the federal legislation made no provision, <i>Automobile Workers </i>v. <i>Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html">383 U. S. 696</a>, 703-704 (1966), and in seeking the right state rule to apply, courts look to the state statute "\'most closely analogous\'" to the federal Act in need, <i>Reed, supra, </i>at 323, quoting <i>DelCostello, supra, </i>at 158. Because this penchant to borrow from analogous state law is not only "longstanding," <i>Agency Holding Corp., supra, </i>at 147, but "settled," <i>Wilson, supra, </i>at 266, "it is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [our] precedents ... and that it expect[s] its enactment[s] to be interpreted in conformity with them," <i>Cannon </i>v. <i>University of Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 699 (1979). See <i>Agency Holding Corp., supra, </i>at 147.*</p><p>There is, of course, a secondary lender, for we have recognized "a closely circumscribed ... [and] narrow exception to the general rule," <i>Reed, supra, </i>at 324, based on the common sense that Congress would not wish courts to apply a limitations period that would only stymie the policies underlying the federal cause of action. So, when the state limitations periods with any claim of relevance would "\'frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies,\'" <i>DelCostello, supra, </i>at 161, quoting <i>Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. </i>v. <i>EEOC, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/355/case.html">432 U. S. 355</a>, 367 (1977), or be "at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law," <i>DelCostello, supra, </i>at 161, we have looked for a period that might be provided by analogous federal law, more in harmony with the objectives of the immediate cause of action. See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis </i>&amp; <i>Petigrow </i>v. <i>Gilbertson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/350/case.html">501 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 1658 (1988 ed., Supp. V), which supplies a general, 4-year limitations period for any federal statute subsequently enacted without one of its own.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="35">35</a></p><p>153, 156; <i>DelCostello, supra, </i>at 171-172. But the reference to federal law is the exception, and we decline to follow a state limitations period "only \'when a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.\' " <i>Reed, supra, </i>at 324, quoting <i>DelCostello, supra, </i>at 172.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>These cases fall squarely inside the rule, not the exception.</p><p>The presumption that state law will be the source of a missing federal limitations period was already "longstanding," <i>Agency Holding Corp., </i>483 U. S., at 147, when WARN was passed in 1988, justifying the assumption that Congress "intend[ed] by its silence that we borrow state law," <i>ibid. </i>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals identified four Pennsylvania statutes of limitations that might apply to WARN claims: the 2-year period for enforcing civil penalties generally, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, \xc2\xa7 5524(5) (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.); the 3-year period for claims under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, \xc2\xa7 260.9a(g) (Purdon 1992); the 4-year period for breach of an implied contract, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, \xc2\xa7 5525(4) (Purdon 1981); and the six years under the residual statute of limitations, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, \xc2\xa7 5527 (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.). See 32 F. 3d, at 61. Since the complaints in both <i>Crown Cork </i>and <i>North Star </i>were timely even under the shortest of these, there is no need to go beyond the decision of the Court of Appeals to choose the best of four, and it is enough to say here that none of these potentially applicable statutes would be "at odds" with WARN\'s "purpose or operation," or" \'frustrate or interfere with\'" the intent behind it. <i>DelCostello, </i>462 U. S., at 161.</p><p>The contrast with <i>DelCostello </i>is clear. There the Court declined to borrow state limitations periods for so-called</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="36">36</a></p><p>"hybrid" claims brought by an employee against both his employer and his union, for the reason that the state-law candidates "typically provide[d] very short times" for suit (generally 90 days) and thus "fail[ed] to provide an aggrieved employee with a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate his rights." <i>Id., </i>at 166, and n. 15. Here, the shortest of the arguably usable state periods, however, is two years, which is not short enough to frustrate an employee seeking relief under WARN. At the other end, even the longest of the periods, six years, is not long enough to frustrate the interest in "a relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes." See <i>Automobile Workers, supra, </i>at 707 (borrowing a 6-year state limitations period for claims brought under \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act).</p><p>We do not take petitioners to disagree seriously, for the heart of their argument is not that the state periods are too long or too short. They submit instead that, if we look to state law, WARN litigation presents undue risks of forum shopping, such that we ought to pick a uniform federal rule for all claims (with the NLRA, and its 6-month limitations period for unfair labor practices claims, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 160(b), being the federal Act most analogous to WARN). But even taking petitioners on their own terms, they make no case for choosing the exception over the rule. They are right, of course, that the practice of adopting state statutes of limitations for federal causes of action can result in different limitations periods in different States for the same federal action, and correct that some plaintiffs will canvass the variations and shop around for a forum. But these are just the costs of the rule itself, and nothing about WARN makes them exorbitant.</p><p>It is, indeed, true that "practicalities of litigation" influenced our rationale for adopting a uniform federal rule for civil actions under RICO. <i>Agency Holding Corp., supra, </i>at 153. But WARN\'s obligations are triggered by a "plant closing" or a "mass layoff" at a "single site of employment,"</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="37">37</a></p><p>29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2101(a)(2)-(3), and so, unlike RICO violations, do not "commonly involve interstate transactions." <i>Agency Holding Corp., </i>483 U. S., at 153. WARN thus fails to share the "multi state nature" of RICO, id., at 154, and is so relatively simple and narrow in its scope, see id., at 149 (listing the many categories of crimes that can be predicate acts for a RICO violation), that "no [comparable] practicalities of litigation compel us to search beyond state law for a more analogous statute of limitations," <i>Reed, </i>488 U. S., at 327. Since, then, a state counterpart provides a limitations period without frustrating consequences, it is simply beside the point that even a perfectly good federal analogue exists.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p><p>Affirmed.</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>I remain of the view that when Congress has not prescribed a limitations period to govern a cause of action that it has created, the Court should apply the appropriate state statute of limitations, or, if doing so would frustrate the purposes of the federal enactment, no limitations period at all. See <i>Agency Holding Corp. </i>v. <i>Malley-Duff </i>&amp; <i>Associates, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/case.html">483 U. S. 143</a>, 157-170 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); see also <i>Reed </i>v. <i>Transportation Union, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/319/case.html">488 U. S. 319</a>, 334 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). The rule first announced in <i>DelCostello </i>v. <i>Teamsters, 462 </i>U. S. 151, 172 (1983), that a federal limitations period should be selected when it presents a "closer analogy" to the federal cause of action and is "significantly more appropriate," I find to be not only erroneous but unworkable. If the "closer analogy" part of this is to be taken seriously, the federal statute would end up applying in some States but not in others; and the "significantly more appropriate" part is meaningless, since in all honesty a uniform nationwide limitations period for a federal cause of action is <i>always </i>significantly more appropriate.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="38">38</a></p><p>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment</p><p>I have joined in applying to a so-called "implied" cause of action the limitations period contained in the federal statute out of which the cause of action had been judicially created. See <i>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis </i>&amp; <i>Petigrow </i>v. <i>Gilbertson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/350/case.html">501 U. S. 350</a>, 364-366 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But the cause of action at issue here was created not by us, but by Congress. Accordingly, in my view, the appropriate state statute of limitations governs.</p><p>Because none of the state statutes arguably applicable here would frustrate the purposes of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2101 <i>et seq., </i>and because the WARN actions before us are timely under even the shortest of those statutes, I concur in the Court\'s judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
