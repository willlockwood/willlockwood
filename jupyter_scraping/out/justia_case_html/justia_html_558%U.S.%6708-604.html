As amended, the Act mandates arbitration of \xe2\x80\x9cminor disputes\xe2\x80\x9d before panels composed of two representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as tiebreaker.  <em>Union Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Price</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/360/601/index.html">360 U. S. 601</a>, 610\xe2\x80\x93613.  To supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons representing labor and industry in equal numbers.  45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7153 First (a).  Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining agreement (hereinafter CBA), see \xc2\xa7153 First (i), a stage known as \xe2\x80\x9con-property\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  As a final prearbitration step, the parties must attempt settlement \xe2\x80\x9cin conference\xe2\x80\x9d between representatives of the carrier and the grievant-employee.  \xc2\xa7152 Second, Sixth.  The RLA contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences, but does not \xe2\x80\x9csupersede the provisions of any agreement (as to conferences) \xe2\x80\xa6 between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7152 Sixth; in common practice the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation.  If the parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the NRAB.  \xc2\xa7153 First (i).  Submissions to the Board must include \xe2\x80\x9ca full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order on one or more stated grounds:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfailure \xe2\x80\xa6 to comply with the requirements of [the RLA], \xe2\x80\xa6 failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, or \xe2\x80\xa6 fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7153 First (q).  Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in \xc2\xa7153 First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the CBA.  The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five disputes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration before the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s First Division.  Both parties filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.  Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to \xe2\x80\x9cset forth all relevant, argumentative facts,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7301.5(d), (e).  Just prior to the hearing, one of the arbitration panel\xe2\x80\x99s industry representatives objected, <em>sua sponte</em>, that the on-property record included no proof of conferencing.  The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection.  The referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing.  The Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected before the date set for argument.  The panel, in five identical decisions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction.  The record could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was not empowered to consider <em>de novo </em>evidence and arguments.  The Union sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d at issue was whether written documentation of the conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequisite in the statute or rules.  But instead of resting its decision on the Union\xe2\x80\x99s primary, statute-based argument\xe2\x80\x94that the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\xe2\x80\x94it reversed on the ground that the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings were incompatible with due process.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union\xe2\x80\x99s appeal under a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline.  This Court granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding \xc2\xa7153 First (q)\xe2\x80\x99s limited grounds for review.  But so long as a respondent does not \xe2\x80\x9cseek to modify the judgment below,\xe2\x80\x9d true here, the respondent may \xe2\x80\x9crely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blum</em> v. <em>Bacon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/132/index.html">457 U. S. 132</a>, 137, n.\xc2\xa05.  The Seventh Circuit understood that the Union had pressed \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory and constitutional\xe2\x80\x9d arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on a \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d:\xc2\xa0is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?  Answering this \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d in the negative, the Seventh Circuit effectively resolved the Union\xe2\x80\x99s core complaint.  Because nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d leaves no doubt about the Union\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement, in accord with \xc2\xa7153 First (q), to vacation of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s orders.  Given this statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case.  Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here enables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over matters properly typed \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting and processing claims, \xc2\xa7153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on the false premise that it lacked \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to hear them, the NRAB panel failed \xe2\x80\x9cto conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7153 First (q).

Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers to a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98power to hear a case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98can never be forfeited or waived.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 514.  In contrast, a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim-processing rule\xe2\x80\x9d does not reduce a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U. S. 443</a>, 456.  For example, this Court has held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before proceeding to court, <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U.

S. 205</a>, 209\xe2\x80\x93211.  Here, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance prearbitration, attempt settlement \xe2\x80\x9cin conference,\xe2\x80\x9d is imposed on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation does not condition the Board\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority, which extends to \xe2\x80\x9call disputes between carriers and their employees \xe2\x80\x98growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Slocum</em> v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/239/index.html">339 U. S. 239</a>, 240 (quoting \xc2\xa7153 First (i)).  When a CBA\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the conference requirement is independent of the CBA process.  Rooted in \xc2\xa7152, the RLA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral duties\xe2\x80\x9d section, and not moored to the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[e]stablishment[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 powers[,] and duties\xe2\x80\x9d set out in \xc2\xa7153 First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable in <em>Zipes. </em> And if the conference requirement is not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d then failure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be of that genre.  And although the Carrier alleges that NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdictional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction, surely the panels themselves lack that authority.  Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.  Instructions on party submissions are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules.  The Board itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion in dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d and when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented  \xe2\x80\x9cdata\xe2\x80\x9d supporting the employee\xe2\x80\x99s grievance, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7301(d)\xe2\x80\x94evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties\xe2\x80\x99 right to order for themselves the conference procedures they will follow.

While Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s statement bears \xe2\x80\x9cfine tuning,\xe2\x80\x9d there is surely a starting presumption that when jurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exercise it.

The general rule applicable to courts also holds for administrative agencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular controversies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress vested in the National Railroad Adjustment Board (hereinafter NRAB or Board) jurisdiction to adjudicate grievances of railroad employees that remain unsettled after pursuit of internal procedures.  45 U.

Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the presentation and processing of claims, \xc2\xa7153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  By presuming authority to declare procedural rules \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel failed \xe2\x80\x9cto conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7153 First (q).

(hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations.  Their union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the CBA.  The Union asserts that, following exhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties conferenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at argument that at least two of the disputes were conferenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration before the First Division of the NRAB.  The Union and the Carrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous submissions in the five cases.  In each submission, the Union included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the hearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating to the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance proceeding.  Neither party mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.  Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred, and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s governing rule instructs carriers and employees to \xe2\x80\x9cset forth all relevant, argumentative facts,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7301.5(d), (e).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the employees\xe2\x80\x99 claims, one of the industry representatives on the arbitration panel raised an objection.  Petition to Review and Vacate Awards and Orders of First Div. NRAB in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93civ\xe2\x80\x932401 (ND Ill.), \xc2\xb620 (hereinafter Pet. to Review).  On his own initiative, unprompted by the Carrier, and in executive session, the industry representative asserted that the on-property record included no proof of conferencing.  See <em>ibid.</em>  The Carrier thereafter embraced the panel member\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  The neutral referee informed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hearing, allowing the Union \xe2\x80\x9cto submit evidence that conferencing had in fact occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb621\xe2\x80\x9323.  The Union did so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and correspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing in each of the five cases.  <em>E.g.</em>, Panel Decision 67a\xe2\x80\x9368a.  From its first notice of the objection, however, the Union maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had not objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 67a; Pet. to Review \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb622, 29, 30, 54.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of conferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical decisions, dismissed the petitions for want of \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to assume jurisdiction over the claim[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Panel Decision 72a.  Citing Circular One, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe weight of arbitral precedent,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidentiary record\xe2\x80\x9d must be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cclosed once a Notice of Intent has been filed with the NRAB \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Panel Decision 71a.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In explaining why the record could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection, the panel emphasized that it was \xe2\x80\x9can appellate tribunal, as opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule on <em>de novo </em>evidence and arguments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 69a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two labor representatives dissented.  The Carrier\xe2\x80\x99s submissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on failure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore, they concluded, under a \xe2\x80\x9cwell settled principle governing the Board\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations,\xe2\x80\x9d the Carrier had forfeited the issue.  <em>Id.</em>, at 105a\xe2\x80\x93106a.  The dissenters urged that the Union had furnished evidence showing \xe2\x80\x9cthe cases had all been conferenced, even though the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 105a.  Dismissal of the claims, the dissenters charged, demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of gamesmanship that breeds contempt for the minor dispute process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 107a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Union filed a petition for review in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asking the court to set aside the Board\xe2\x80\x99s orders on the ground that the panel had \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully held [it lacked] authority to assume jurisdiction over [the] cases [absent] evidence of a \xe2\x80\x98conference\xe2\x80\x99 between the parties in the \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98on-property\xe2\x80\x99 record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. to Review \xc2\xb61.  Nothing in the Act or the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rules, the Union maintained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove conferencing in the Union\xe2\x80\x99s original submission.  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63, 4.  By imposing, without warrant, \xe2\x80\x9ca technical pleading or evidentiary requirement\xe2\x80\x9d and elevating it to jurisdictional status, the Union charged, the panel had \xe2\x80\x9cegregiously violate[d] the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb63, or \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to conform its jurisdiction to that required by \xe2\x80\xa6 law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb64.  Alternatively, the Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due process by entertaining the Carrier\xe2\x80\x99s untimely objection, even though \xe2\x80\x9cthe Carrier had failed to raise any objection as to lack of conferencing\xe2\x80\x9d in its submissions.  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb65.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court affirmed the Board\xe2\x80\x99s orders.  Addressing the Union\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the no-proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted the panel\xe2\x80\x99s description of the issue as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and noted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional challenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings.  432 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 768, 777, and n. 7 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Seventh Circuit recognized that the Union had presented its case \xe2\x80\x9cthrough both a statutory and constitutional framework.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 F.\xc2\xa03d 746, 750 (2008).  The court observed, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe essence of the conflict boils down to a single question: is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the NRAB?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It then determined that there was no such prerequisite: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o statute, regulation, or CBA,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9crequired the evidence [of conferencing] to be presented in the on-property record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 757\xe2\x80\x93758.  But instead of resting its decision on the Union\xe2\x80\x99s primary, statute-based argument\xe2\x80\x94that the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\xe2\x80\x94the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings were incompatible with due process.  See <em>id.</em>, at 750.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the Carrier\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, 555 U.

See <em>supra,</em> at 6, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Appearing as respondent in this Court, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on an alternative ground.  Reasserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition for court review, see <em>supra</em>, at 9, the Union maintained that the Board did not \xe2\x80\x9cconform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7153 First (q).  Brief for Respondent 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  In response, the Carrier stated that the Union\xe2\x80\x99s alternative ground \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a pure question of law that th[e] Court can and should resolve without need for remand.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 24, n.\xc2\xa09.

S. 132</a>, 137, n.\xc2\xa05 (1982).  The Seventh Circuit, as just observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, understood that the Union had pressed \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory and constitutional\xe2\x80\x9d arguments, but also comprehended that both arguments homed in on \xe2\x80\x9ca single question: is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the NRAB?\xe2\x80\x9d  522 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 750.  Answering this \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d in the negative, the Court of Appeals effectively resolved the Union\xe2\x80\x99s core complaint.  But, for reasons far from apparent, the court declared that \xe2\x80\x9conce we answer the key question \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, adjudication of the due process claim is unavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question, but inappropriately placed its answer under a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline.  As the Court of Appeals determined, and as we discuss <em>infra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9317, nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing.  That being so, the \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion, following from the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9canswer [to] the key question,\xe2\x80\x9d 522 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 750, is that the panel, in \xc2\xa7153 First (q)\xe2\x80\x99s words, failed \xe2\x80\x9cto conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Carrier, although it sought a different outcome, was quite right to \xe2\x80\x9curg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory claim before the constitutional one.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 750.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, a negative answer to the \xe2\x80\x9csingle question\xe2\x80\x9d identified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about the Union\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement, in accord with \xc2\xa7153 First (q), to vacation of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s orders.  Given this statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in \xc2\xa7153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing court set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility with due process?  An answer to that question must await a case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In this case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to address a matter of some importance: We can reduce confusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over matters properly typed \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing that the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d has been used by courts, including this Court, to convey \xe2\x80\x9cmany, too many, meanings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/83/index.html">523 U.

In contrast, a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim-processing rule, \xe2\x80\xa6 even if unalterable on a party\xe2\x80\x99s application,\xe2\x80\x9d does not reduce the adjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U.

True, the RLA instructs that, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute \xe2\x80\x9cshall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the [designated] chief operating officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7153 First (i).  And when the CBA\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is independent of the CBA process.  Rather, the conference requirement is stated in the \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral duties\xe2\x80\x9d section of the RLA, \xc2\xa7152, a section that is not moored to the \xe2\x80\x9c[e]stablishment[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 powers[,] and duties\xe2\x80\x9d of the NRAB set out next in \xc2\xa7153 First.  Rooted in \xc2\xa7152 and often informal in practice, see <em>supra,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, conferencing is surely no more \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held forfeitable in <em>Zipes</em>, 455 U. S., at 393.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  And if the requirement to conference is not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d then failure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be of that genre.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In defense of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of conferencing and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points to the NRAB\xe2\x80\x99s Circular One procedural regulations, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, which provide: \xe2\x80\x9cNo petition shall be considered by any division of the Board unless the subject matter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of the [RLA].\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7301.2(b).  But that provision, as other prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing rule.  Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules of jurisdictional dimension.  See 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7153 First (v) (authorizing the NRAB to \xe2\x80\x9cadopt such rules as it deems necessary to control proceedings before the respective divisions and not in conflict with the provisions of this section\xe2\x80\x9d).  And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely contested, we see no reason why the panel could not adjourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse.  Circular One does not exclude such a sensible solution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support characterization of conferencing as jurisdictional.  If the NRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its panels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that authority.  Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter.  For example, in NRAB Third Div. Award No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although characterizing the conferencing requirement as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d said that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to avail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to do so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2.  See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No. 5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No. 28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same).  Cf. <em>Arbaugh</em>, 546 U.

And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p.\xc2\xa05 (Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary remedy for lack of conferencing is to \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss th[e] claim without prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional defect.\xe2\x80\x9d  That panel reached the merits nevertheless.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Cf. <em>Steel Co.</em>, 523 U.

Moreover, the Board itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion in dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  It has counseled parties submitting joint exhibits \xe2\x80\x9cto omit documents that are unimportant and/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for example \xe2\x80\xa6 letters requesting a conference (assuming that is <em>not</em> an issue in the dispute).\xe2\x80\x9d  NRAB Instructions Sheet, Joint Exh.

It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor the Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified conferencing as a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion in dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented \xe2\x80\x9cdata \xe2\x80\xa6 in support of [the] employee[\xe2\x80\x99s] [grievance],\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7301.5(d)\xe2\x80\x94evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.  A contrary rule would sandbag the carrier.  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.  Indeed, there may be no disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferencing, as the Union believed to be the case here.  Moreover, the RLA respects the right of the parties to order for themselves the conference procedures they will follow.  See 45 U.
