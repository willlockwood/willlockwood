Plaintiff, choosing that the proceedings should go up above, as they were below, took out a Certiorari, and, going into court the first day of the term, got it allowed. The next day the defendant presented the Habeas Corpus, to which plaintiff\'s attorney objected, for that the record was removed by the Certiorari.

Secondly, that if that could not be allowed, yet both writs might be returned reddendo singula singulis; the Certiorari might remove the cause, and the Habeas Corpus the body; and there was no inconsistency in so doing. </p><p> The defendants council rested it on the advantage taken of him, and on the constant practice of the court with respect to writs of removal. </p><p></p><p> BY THE COURT.
