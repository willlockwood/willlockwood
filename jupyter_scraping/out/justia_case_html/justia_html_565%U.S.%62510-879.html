The Court rejected the States\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the scope of the pre-empted field was to \xe2\x80\x9cbe determined by the object sought through legislation, rather than the physical elements affected by it,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 612, and found it dispositive that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the same subject\xe2\x80\x95the equipment of locomotives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.  Instead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments are unpersuasive.  First, the argument that the pre-empted field does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Congress, in enacting the LIA, \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611.  Second, the argument that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied by sufficient warnings or instructions.  Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by Napier.  Third, the argument that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are not pre-empted because manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation.  Finally, contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope is not limited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive equipment.

According to the complaint, RFPC distributed locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad was the successor-in-interest to a company that manufactured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves containing asbestos.  Corson alleged that he handled this equipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbestos.  The complaint asserted state-law claims that the equipment was defectively designed because it contained asbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dangers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its safe use.  After the complaint was filed, Corson passed away, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was substituted as a party.

In response, the States argued that their requirements were not pre-empted because they were directed at a different objective than the LIA.  Id., at 612.  According to the States, their regulations were intended to protect railroad workers from sickness and disease, whereas \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal regulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in  the operation of trains.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo determine whether the state requirements were pre-empted, this Court asked whether the LIA \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[s] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment[.]\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 611.

We address each of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments in turn.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), \n\n84Stat.\n971 (codified at \n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa720102 et\xc2\xa0seq.), altered the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope.  The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation broad regulatory authority over railroad safety.  See \xc2\xa720103(a).  Petitioners point to the FRSA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision, which provides in part that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] State may adopt or continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to railroad safety .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. until the Secretary of Transportation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the State requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720106(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. III).  According to petitioners, the FRSA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision supplanted the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption of the field, with the result that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are not pre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regulation or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives or locomotive parts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the FRSA is misplaced.  The FRSA instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary of Transportation, as necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720103(a) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).  By its terms, the FRSA does not alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.  \xe2\x80\x9cRather, it leaves existing statutes intact,\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and authorizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supplemental regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Marshall v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 720 F.\xc2\xa02d 1149, 1152\xe2\x80\x931153 (CA9 1983) (Kennedy, J.).  Because the LIA was already in effect when the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Napier, intact.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSince the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered, petitioners must contend with Napier.  Petitioners do not ask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to overcome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this 85-year-old precedent.  See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.\xc2\xa0A., 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force of the doctrine of stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Instead, petitioners advance several arguments aimed at demonstrating that their claims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it was defined in Napier.  Each is unpersuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus curiae, first argue that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims do not fall within the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-empted field because the claims arise out of the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than the use of locomotives on a railroad line.  Specifically, they contend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA is coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue, does not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives.  Therefore, the argument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or maintenance\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to claims arising from use on the line\xe2\x80\x94do not fall within the pre-empted field.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field. In Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the LIA, \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court did not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and maintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the line.  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611.  The pre-empted field as defined by Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 common-law claims for defective design and failure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.  Because those claims \xe2\x80\x9care directed to the same subject\xe2\x80\x9d as the LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre-empted field.

In their complaint, petitioners alleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents negligently failed to warn of the risks associated with asbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe- guards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestos- containing products were defective because respondents failed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con- cerning the \xe2\x80\x9crisks, dangers, and harm inherent in said asbestos products.\xe2\x80\x9d  See App. 20\xe2\x80\x9327 (\xc2\xb6\xc2\xb67\xe2\x80\x9310, 12), 42 (\xc2\xb68); see also Brief for Petitioners 11.  According to petitioners, these claims do not fall within the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-empted field because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not the \xe2\x80\x98design\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98manufacture\xe2\x80\x99 of a product,\xe2\x80\x9d but is instead \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure to provide adequate warnings regarding the product\xe2\x80\x99s risks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe disagree.  A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the product itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied by sufficient warnings or instructions.  Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \xc2\xa72(c) (1997) (A failure-to-warn claim alleges that a product is defective \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor,\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe\xe2\x80\x9d); see also id., Comment l, at 33 (\xe2\x80\x9cReasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the production and distribution of reasonably safe products\xe2\x80\x9d).

Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by Napier.  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 612.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners also contend that their state-law claims against manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts fall outside of the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-empted field because manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that Corson was allegedly exposed to asbestos.  Petitioners point out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA, subjected only common carriers to civil penalties.  Act of Feb. 17, 1911, \xc2\xa79, \n\n36Stat.\n916.  It was not until 1988, well after the events of this case, that the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s penalty provision was revised to apply to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person\xe2\x80\x9d violating the LIA.

Napier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the basis of the physical elements regulated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe equipment of locomotives\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation.  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 612.

Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 approach, a State could not require railroads to equip their locomotives with parts meeting state-imposed specifications, but could require manufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts meeting those state-imposed specifications.  We rejected a similar approach in an express pre-emption context in Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246 (2004)\n.  There, a state entity argued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of vehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions requirements were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77543(a), because the rules in question were aimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248.  We observed, however, that \xe2\x80\x9ctreating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions differently for pre-emption purposes would make no sense,\xe2\x80\x9d because the \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s right to sell federally approved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s right to buy them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 255.  Similarly, a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compliance with federal standards is meaningless if manufacturers are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive parts that meet those standards.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims thus do not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at the manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, petitioners contend that the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope does not extend to state common-law claims, as opposed to state legislation or regulation.  Petitioners note that \xe2\x80\x9ca preempted field does not necessarily include state common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (citing Silkwood v.

A failure-to-warn claim asks nothing of a product\xe2\x80\x99s de- sign, but requires instead that a manufacturer caution of nonobvious dangers and provide instructions for safe use.  Indeed, a product may be flawlessly designed and still subject its manufacturer or seller to liability for lack of adequate instructions or warnings.  See, e.g., Madden, The Duty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criticism, 89 W.\xc2\xa0Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 221 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough a product is unerringly designed, manufactured and assembled, injury or damage occasioned by its intended or reasonably foreseeable use may subject the seller to liability.  Such liability may be found if the product has a potential for injury that is not readily apparent to the user\xe2\x80\x9d (cited in Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \xc2\xa72, Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Note, Comment i, n. 1 (1997) (hereinafter Restatement)); see also Madden, 89 W.\xc2\xa0Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 221, n.\xc2\xa01 (collecting cases).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint embodies just this conceptual distinction.

Wyeth v. Levine, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, \n565 (2009)\n.  Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state damages award based on a drug manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intravenous administration of the drug, but noted that it was unnecessary to decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a state rule proscribing intravenous administration would be pre-empted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

See ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (citing Restatement \xc2\xa72(c) and Comment l).  That may be true at a high level of gener- ality, but \xe2\x80\x9c[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rest on different factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement \xc2\xa72, at 35, Comment n.  For example, a manufacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasonably unsafe design merely by issuing a warning.  See id., at 33, Comment l (\xe2\x80\x9cWarnings are not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a substitute for the provision of a reasonably safe design\xe2\x80\x9d).  In a fundamental sense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by taking a product\xe2\x80\x99s physical design as a given.  A failure-to-warn claim alleges a \xe2\x80\x9cdefect\xe2\x80\x9d by asserting that a product, as designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a warning\xe2\x80\x94not that a product must be designed differently.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority further conflates defective-design and failure-to-warn claims by noting that each is \xe2\x80\x9cdirected at\xe2\x80\x9d locomotive equipment.  Ante, at 9.  That is insufficient.  Not every state law that \xe2\x80\x9ccould be said to affect tangentially\xe2\x80\x9d matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.  English v. General Elec. Co., \n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 72, \n85 (1990)\n.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone, it must have some direct and substantial effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the primary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.  Ibid.  As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical equipment of locomotives.  But petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the physical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents themselves acknowledge.  See Brief for Respondents 55 (petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims \xe2\x80\x9cmay not themselves literally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive\xe2\x80\x99s design or construction\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to warn and the accompanying threat of liability will inevitably influence\xe2\x80\x9d a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s design choices.  Ante, at 9, n.\xc2\xa04.  But an \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence\xe2\x80\x9d is not the same as an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect,\xe2\x80\x9d and not every state law with some imaginable impact on matters within a federally regulated field is, for that reason alone, pre-empted.  See English, 496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85\xe2\x80\x9386;  Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n256 (1984)\n.  Indeed, the majority elides the distinction between indirect and direct regulation, even though this Court has explained that the two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes.  See Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, \n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 174, \n186 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may reasonably determine that incidental reg- ulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory authority is not\xe2\x80\x9d).  State wage-and-hour laws, work- place safety standards, or tax credits for green technology, for example, could all \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence\xe2\x80\x9d the means and materials of locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing direct obligations.  Nor does the majority substantiate its assertion that the \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence\xe2\x80\x9d exerted by a duty to warn need be \xe2\x80\x9cinevitabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9, n.\xc2\xa04.  To the contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty could be light, and the corresponding liability negligible, in comparison to the commercial value of retaining an existing design.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents could have complied with state-law duties to warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance of asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man- uals.  See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine Manual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at http://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html (last visited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Or respondents could have ensured that repair shops posted signs.  See Restatement \xc2\xa72, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330, Comment i (duty to warn \xe2\x80\x9cmay require that instructions and warnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and consumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller should know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the risk of harm\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, e.g., Patch v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P.\xc2\xa03d 383, 388 (2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile placing a warning directly on a product is one method of warning, other methods of warning exist, including, but not limited to, issuing oral warnings and placing warnings in advertisements, posters, and media releases\xe2\x80\x9d).

The majority is therefore wrong to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98gravamen\xe2\x80\x99 of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims \xe2\x80\x98is still that [Corson] suffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure to asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurtenances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (quoting Kurns v. A. W. Chesteron, Inc., 620 F.\xc2\xa03d 392, 398, n.\xc2\xa08 (CA3 2010)).  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cgravamen\xe2\x80\x9d of these claims is that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 decedent George Corson could have avoided the harmful consequences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely the same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him, for example, to wear a mask.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, preserving petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims coheres with the LIA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory regime.  Neither the Interstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first delegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now belongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and maintenance.  To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it lacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive maintenance and repair facilities.

Atwell, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2010, No. 10\xe2\x80\x93272, p.\xc2\xa010 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he field covered by the LIA does not include requirements concerning the repair of locomotives that are not in use\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe preempted field .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not include tort claims based on injuries arising when locomotives are not in use\xe2\x80\x9d).  The FRA has determined that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself, bears primary responsibility for workplace safety, including with respect to hazardous materials.  43 Fed.

And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that address warnings specific to maintenance and repair.  Because the pre-empted field is congruent with the regulated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89, \n112 (2000)\n, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision sweeps far too broadly.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive effect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petitioners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex- posure to asbestos in repair facilities.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Silkwood, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605 (1926)\n, in the same way today.  The Napier Court concluded that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d based on nothing more than a statute granting regulatory authority over that subject matter to a federal agency.  Id., at 611.  Under our more recent cases, Congress must do much more to oust all of state law from a field.  See, e.g., New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, \n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405, \n415 (1973)\n (rejecting preemption even though Congress had enacted a \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory scheme).  Viewed through the lens of modern preemption law, Napier is an anachronism.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Napier governs so long as Congress lets it\xe2\x80\x94and that decision provides a straightforward way to determine whether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are preempted.  According to Napier, the scope of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) determines the boundaries of the preempted field.  See 272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because they fell \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of the authority delegated to the Commission\xe2\x80\x9d); see also ante, at 5 (the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98broad scope of the authority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d given to the agency \xe2\x80\x9cled to [Napier\xe2\x80\x99s] conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d); post, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he pre-empted field is congruent with the regulated field\xe2\x80\x9d).  And under that test, none of the state-law claims at issue here can survive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll of us agree that the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 defective-design claims are preempted.  Napier recognized the federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s delegated authority over \xe2\x80\x9cthe design, the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive.\xe2\x80\x9d  272 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611.  In doing so, Napier did not distinguish between \xe2\x80\x9chazards arising from repair and maintenance\xe2\x80\x9d of the parts and hazards stemming from their \xe2\x80\x9cuse on the line.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.  The agency thus has authority to regulate the design of locomotive equipment\xe2\x80\x94like the asbetos-containing brakeshoes here\xe2\x80\x94to prevent either danger.  And that fact resolves the preemption question.  Because the agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as designed, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 defective-design claims\xe2\x80\x94which would effectively accomplish the identical result\xe2\x80\x94fall within the preempted field.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo too the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims, and for the same reason.  Napier did not specifically address warnings, because the case in no way involved them.  But if an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomotive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use of that equipment on proper warnings.  (And that is so, contrary to Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s view, see post, at 8, n. 3, whether the warning is engraved into the part itself or posted on the workshop wall.)  Here, for example, the agency need not have chosen between banning asbestos-containing brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregulated.  It could instead have required a warning about how to handle those brakeshoes safely.  If, say, a mask would have protected a worker from risk, then the agency could have demanded a notice to that effect.  See, e.g., Law v. General Motors Corp., 114 F.\xc2\xa03d 908, 911 (CA9 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs for warning requirements, these too are within the scope of the [agency\xe2\x80\x99s] authority\xe2\x80\x9d); Scheiding v.

Post, at 7.  But that claim conflates two separate distinctions.  The agency draws a line not between mandating design changes and mandating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous to repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the railroad line.  In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted field because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous only their repair, and not their on-line use.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of its author-ity therefore does not support Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s position.  As the agency agrees, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims must stand or fall together if viewed through the lens of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority.  In my view, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency\xe2\x80\x99s proffered distinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and regulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.
