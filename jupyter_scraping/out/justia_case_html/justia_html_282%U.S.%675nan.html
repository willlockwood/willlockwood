S. 676</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Prussian, the petitioner, was convicted in the District Court for Eastern New York of forging an indorsement purporting to be that of a payee of a government draft.  At the trial, by motions to dismiss and in arrest of judgment, the sufficiency of the indictment was challenged on the ground that the offense charged was the forging of an obligation of the United States in violation of \xc2\xa7 148 of the Criminal Code, U.S.C. Title 18, \xc2\xa7 262, and that the indorsement alleged to have been forged was not such an obligation.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment, holding that the indictment sufficiently charged a violation of that section.  42 F.2d 854.</p>\n<p>Certiorari was asked on the ground, among others, that the decision below conflicted with decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  <em>Gesell v. United States,</em> 1 F.2d 283; <em>Lewis v. United States,</em> 8 F.2d 849.  <em>See also White v. Levine,</em> 40 F.2d 502.  In accord with the decision below are <em>Hamil v. United States,</em> 298 F. 369, and <em>Alvarado v. United States,</em> 9 F.2d 385.  <em>Cf. United States v. Jolly,</em> 37 F. 108; <em>De Lemos v. United States,</em> 91 F. 497.  Because of the conflict, the petition was not opposed by the government, although it suggested that the indictment might also be upheld as charging a forgery of a "writing, for the purpose of obtaining . . . from the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 282 U. S. 677</a></p><p> United States . . . any sum of money" under \xc2\xa7 29 of the Criminal Code, U.S.C. Title 18, \xc2\xa7 73.  This Court granted the petition, limiting review to the question whether the indictment stated an offense under the Criminal Code.</p>\n<p>The indictment charged the forging by petitioner of "a certain obligation of the United States," described as the indorsement on a draft, drawn by a disbursing clerk of the United States Treasury upon the Treasurer of the United States and issued to the payee "by falsely making and forging the name of the payee . . . on the back of said draft."  It set out a copy of the draft and the indorsement, and alleged that together they constituted a forged obligation of the United States.  The indictment also set up that the indorsement was "for the purpose of obtaining and receiving from the Treasurer of the United States a sum of money," and was stated to be in violation of both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 29 and 148 of the Criminal Code.</p>\n<p>Under \xc2\xa7 148, "whoever, with intent to defraud, shall falsely make, forge, counterfeit, or alter any obligation or other security of the United States" is guilty of a criminal offense.  Section 147 provides:</p>\n<p>"The words \'obligation or other security of the United States\' shall be held to mean all . . . checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States."</p>\n<p>It is apparent that the draft drawn on the Treasurer by an authorized officer is an "obligation . . . of the United States" both in common parlance and by the express definition of \xc2\xa7 147.  But to extend the meaning of that phrase so as to embrace the indorsement on the government draft is to enlarge the statutory definition, and would be possible only by a strained construction of the language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 147 and 148, inadmissible in the interpretation of criminal statutes, which must be strictly construed.  <em>See Fasulo v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/620/case.html">272 U. S. 620</a></span>; <em>United States v. Salen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/235/237/case.html">235 U. S. 237</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 282 U. S. 678</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The writing described in the indictment, when issued by the drawer, was a check or a draft.  The added indorsement was, in itself, neither a check nor a draft.  We need not stop to consider the argument advanced that the obligation upon the draft does not become complete until it is indorsed (<em>see Hamil v. United States, supra,</em> 298 F. 371), for it overlooks the circumstance that the meaning of "obligation" in \xc2\xa7 148 is narrowed by the definition in \xc2\xa7 147 to specifically enumerated written instruments, including checks or drafts for money, which are complete, as such, within the statutory definition and in common understanding, at least when issued to the payee by an authorized officer of the government.  The indorsement was, at most, the purported obligation of the indorser, not of the United States, and a purported transfer of the title of the draft to the indorsee.  In neither aspect was the indorsement itself an obligation of the United States as defined by \xc2\xa7 147, or such a part of the draft as to constitute the forging of the indorsement a forgery of the draft.</p>\n<p>If the point were doubtful, the doubt would be resolved by a consideration of the purpose and history of the Act of which \xc2\xa7 148 is a part, and a comparison of it with related provisions of the Criminal Code.  Its purpose has been declared by this Court to be the protection of the bonds or currency of the United States, and not the punishment of any fraud or wrong on individuals.  <em>Dunbar v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/156/185/case.html">156 U. S. 185</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/156/185/case.html#193">156 U. S. 193</a></span>.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/132/case.html">32 U. S. </a></span> Turner,</em> 7 Pet. 132,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/132/case.html#136">32 U. S. 136</a></span>; <em>United States v. Stewart,</em> 4 Wash. C.C. 226.  Section 148 is a reenactment of \xc2\xa7 18 of the Act of April 10, 1816, 3 Stat. 266, 275, which made punishable the forgery of bills, notes, orders, or checks of the Bank of the United States.  The legislation took substantially its present form in the Act of June 30, 1864 (c., 13 Stat. 218, 221, 222), \xc2\xa7 10 of which (later R.S. \xc2\xa7 5414) extended its penal provisions to the forgery of "any obligation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 282 U. S. 679</a></p><p> or security of the United States," and \xc2\xa7 13 of which (later R.S. \xc2\xa7 5413) defined obligations of the United States substantially as in the present \xc2\xa7 147.  Before the enactment of the 1864 prototype of \xc2\xa7 148, the purpose of the 1816 Act had been declared, in <em>United States v. Turner, supra,</em> to be "to guard the public from false and counterfeit paper, purporting on its face to be issued by the bank," and it had been held to be inapplicable to a forged indorsement upon a genuine post note of the bank.  <em>United States v. Stewart, supra.</em>  In the light of this history, the omission of any reference to indorsements in \xc2\xa7 148 is not without significance, and it is worthy of note that Congress later enacted laws specifically punishing forgery of indorsements on pension checks and money orders.  Title 38, U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 128; title 18, U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 347.</p>\n<p>But we think the indictment is to be sustained as charging an offense under \xc2\xa7 29 of the Criminal Code, which punishes the forgery of</p>\n<p>"any deed, power of attorney, order, certificate, receipt, contract, or other writing, for the purpose of obtaining or receiving . . . from the United States, or any of their officers or agents, any sum of money."</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges specifically and with certainty the forgery of the indorsement on the draft, for the purpose of obtaining a sum of money from the Treasurer of the United States, and charges a violation of \xc2\xa7 29.  We think the indorsement was a "writing" within that section.  Its language is "comprehensive" and "all-embracing."  <em>Cf. United States v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/231/183/case.html">231 U. S. 183</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/231/183/case.html#188">231 U. S. 188</a></span>.  The writings enumerated have no common characteristic from which a purpose may be inferred to restrict the statute to any particular class of writings.  The addition of "other writing" to the enumeration was therefore not for the purpose of including writings of a limited class, but rather of extending the penal provisions of the statute to all writings of every class if forged for the purpose of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 282 U. S. 680</a></p><p> obtaining money from an officer of the United States.  <em>See Howgate v. United States,</em> 7 App.D.C. 217, 232, 233.  <em>Cf. United States v.Lawrence,</em> 13 Blatch. 211.  It has been generally assumed by the lower federal courts that \xc2\xa7 29 covers the forging of an indorsement.  <em>United States v. Winters,</em> 5 F.2d 321; <em>Gesell v. United States, supra,</em> 1 F.2d 287, 288; <em>White v. Levine, supra; Bailey v. United States,</em> 13 F.2d 325; <em>Lewis v. United States, supra; cf. United States v. Albert,</em> 45 F. 552; <em>De Lemos v. United States, supra.</em> <em>But see, contra, Hamil v. United States, supra,</em> 298 F. 372.  <em>Cf. United States v. Wilson,</em> Fed.Cas. No. 16,732.</p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that the indictment is defective in that it does not charge that the forgery was with intent to defraud the United States.  <em>See White v. Levine, supra,</em> 40 F.2d 503.  No such averment is required by the language of \xc2\xa7 29 relating to forged indorsements.  Other provisions of \xc2\xa7 29 punish the uttering of a forged writing, or presenting any such writing to an officer of the United States in support of any claim, "with intent to defraud the United States."  But the present indictment is not under either of those provisions.  The charge is forgery of the indorsement, which is punishable by the different provision, now in question, if committed merely "for the purpose of obtaining or receiving" from an officer or agent of the United States any sum of money.  This imports an intent to defraud the United States, which the indictment sufficiently charges in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p>Nor is the present indictment defective, as is urged, because its material allegations are uncertain or repugnant.  The accused was left in no uncertainty that he was charged with only a single act, that of forging the indorsement for the specified purpose.  The judgment here would constitute an unmistakable bar to any future prosecution for the same offense.  The validity of the indictment is therefore not affected by the fact that the pleader, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 282 U. S. 681</a></p><p> through excess of caution, has mistakenly stated the act to be a violation of both \xc2\xa7 148 and \xc2\xa7 29.  <em>See Williams v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/382/case.html">168 U. S. 382</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
