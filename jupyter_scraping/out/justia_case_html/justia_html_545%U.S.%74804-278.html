S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 alleging that petitioner violated the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause when its police officers, acting pursuant to official policy or custom, failed to respond to her repeated reports over several hours that her estranged husband had taken their three children in violation of her restraining order against him.  Ultimately, the husband murdered the children.  The District Court granted the town\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, but an en banc majority of the Tenth Circuit reversed, finding that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedural due process claim because a Colorado statute established the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s clear intent to require police to enforce retraining orders, and thus its intent that the order\xe2\x80\x99s recipient have an entitlement to its enforcement.  The court therefore ruled, among other things, that respondent had a protected property interest in the enforcement of her restraining order.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Respondent did not, for Due Process Clause purposes, have a property interest in police enforcement of the restraining order against her husband.

S. 564</a>, 577.  Such entitlements are created by existing rules or understandings stemming from an independent source such as state law.  <em>E.g., ibid</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0A benefit is not a protected entitlement if officials have discretion to grant or deny it.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/index.html">490 U. S. 454</a>, 462\xe2\x80\x93463.  It is inappropriate here to defer to the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Colorado law gave respondent a right to police enforcement of the restraining order.  This Court therefore proceeds to its own analysis.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Colorado law has not created a personal entitlement to enforcement of restraining orders.  It does not appear that state law truly made such enforcement <em>mandatory</em>.  A well-established tradition of police discretion has long coexisted with apparently mandatory arrest statutes.  Cf. <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/41/index.html">527 U. S. 41</a>, 47, n.\xc2\xa02, 62, n.\xc2\xa032.  Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indication than the Colorado statute\xe2\x80\x99s direction to \xe2\x80\x9cuse every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order\xe2\x80\x9d or even to \xe2\x80\x9carrest \xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6 seek a warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  A Colorado officer would likely have some discretion to determine that\xe2\x80\x94despite probable cause to believe a restraining order has been violated\xe2\x80\x94the violation\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances or competing duties counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance.  The practical necessity for discretion is particularly apparent in a case such as this, where the suspected violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown.  In such circumstances, the statute does not appear to require officers to arrest but only to seek a warrant.  That, however, would be an entitlement to nothing but procedure, which cannot be the basis for a property interest.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Even if the statute could be said to make enforcement \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d that would not necessarily mean that respondent has an entitlement to enforcement.  Her alleged interest stems not from common law or contract, but only from a State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>statutory</em> scheme.  If she was given a statutory entitlement, the Court would expect to see some indication of that in the statute itself.  Although the statute spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cprotected person[s]\xe2\x80\x9d such as respondent, it did so in connection with matters other than a right to enforcement.  Most importantly, it spoke directly to the protected person\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate\xe2\x80\x9d contempt proceedings if the order was issued in a civil action, which contrasts tellingly with its conferral of a power merely to \xe2\x80\x9crequest\xe2\x80\x9d initiation of criminal contempt proceedings\xe2\x80\x94and even more dramatically with its complete silence about any power to \xe2\x80\x9crequest\xe2\x80\x9d (much less demand) that an arrest be made.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Even were the Court to think otherwise about Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s creation of an entitlement, it is not clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d interest for due process purposes.  Such a right would have no ascertainable monetary value and would arise incidentally<em>, </em>not out of some new species of government benefit or service, but out of a function that government actors have always performed\xe2\x80\x94arresting people when they have probable cause.  A benefit\xe2\x80\x99s indirect nature was fatal to a due process claim in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Bannon</em> v. <em>Town Court Nursing Center,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/773/index.html">447 U. S. 773</a>, 787.  Here, as there, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he simple distinction between government action that directly affects a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s legal rights \xe2\x80\xa6 and action that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only \xe2\x80\xa6 incidentally, provides a sufficient answer to\xe2\x80\x9d cases finding government-provided services to be entitlements.  <em>Id.,</em> at 788.

No advance arrangements had been made for him to see the daughters that evening.  When respondent noticed the children were missing, she suspected her husband had taken them.  At about 7:30 p.m., she called the Castle Rock Police Department, which dispatched two officers.  The complaint continues: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen [the officers] arrived \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, she showed them a copy of the TRO and requested that it be enforced and the three children be returned to her immediately.

She called at midnight and told the dispatcher her children were still missing.  She went to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and, finding nobody there, called the police at 12:10 a.m.; she was told to wait for an officer to arrive.  When none came, she went to the police station at 12:50 a.m. and submitted an incident report.  The officer who took the report \xe2\x80\x9cmade no reasonable effort to enforce the TRO or locate the three children.

On rehearing en banc, a divided court reached the same disposition, concluding that respondent had a \xe2\x80\x9cprotected property interest in the enforcement of the terms of her restraining order\xe2\x80\x9d and that the town had deprived her of due process because \xe2\x80\x9cthe police never \xe2\x80\x98heard\xe2\x80\x99 nor seriously entertained her request to enforce and protect her interests in the restraining order.\xe2\x80\x9d  366 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1101, 1117.

It is on this point that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s call for deference to the Tenth Circuit is relevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have said that a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of deference [is] given the views of a federal court as to the law of a State within its jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Phillips, supra,</em> at 167.  That presumption can be overcome, however, see <em>Leavitt</em> v. <em>Jane\xc2\xa0L.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/137/index.html">518 U. S. 137</a>, 145 (1996) <em>(per curiam), </em>and we think deference inappropriate here.  The Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, which reversed the Colorado District Judge, did not draw upon a deep well of state-specific expertise, but consisted primarily of quoting language from the restraining order, the statutory text, and a state-legislative-hearing transcript.  See 366 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1103\xe2\x80\x931109.  These texts, moreover, say nothing distinctive to Colorado, but use mandatory language that (as we shall discuss) appears in many state and federal statutes.  As for case law: the only state-law cases about restraining orders that the Court of Appeals relied upon were decisions of Federal District Courts in Ohio and Pennsylvania and state courts in New Jersey, Oregon, and Tennessee.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1104\xe2\x80\x931105, n.\xc2\xa09, 1109.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Moreover, if we were simply to accept the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion, we would necessarily have to decide conclusively a federal constitutional question (<em>i.e.</em>, whether such an entitlement constituted property under the Due Process Clause and, if so, whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s customs or policies provided too little process to protect it).  We proceed, then, to our own analysis of whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to enforcement of the restraining order.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The critical language in the restraining order came not from any part of the order itself (which was signed by the state-court trial judge and directed to the restrained party, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s husband), but from the preprinted notice to law-enforcement personnel that appeared on the back of the order.  See <em>supra,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  That notice effectively restated the statutory provision describing \xe2\x80\x9cpeace officers\xe2\x80\x99 duties\xe2\x80\x9d related to the crime of violation of a restraining order.  At the time of the conduct at issue in this case, that provision read as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Whenever a restraining order is issued, the protected person shall be provided with a copy of such order.  <em>A peace officer shall use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) A peace officer shall arrest, or, if an arrest would be impractical under the circumstances, seek a warrant for the arrest of a restrained person</em> when the peace officer has information amounting to probable cause that:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(I) The restrained person has violated or attempted to violate any provision of a restraining order; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(II) The restrained person has been properly served with a copy of the restraining order or the restrained person has received actual notice of the existence and substance of such order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(c) In making the probable cause determination described in paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), a peace officer shall assume that the information received from the registry is accurate.  <em>A peace officer shall enforce a valid restraining order whether or not there is a record of the restraining order in the registry</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colo.

Any other result, it said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould render domestic abuse restraining orders utterly valueless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1109.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This last statement is sheer hyperbole.  Whether or not respondent had a right to enforce the restraining order, it rendered certain otherwise lawful conduct by her husband both criminal and in contempt of court.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(2)(a), (7).  The creation of grounds on which he could be arrested, criminally prosecuted, and held in contempt was hardly \xe2\x80\x9cvalueless\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if the prospect of those sanctions ultimately failed to prevent him from committing three murders and a suicide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not believe that these provisions of Colorado law truly made enforcement of restraining orders <em>mandatory</em>.

However, for a number of reasons, including their legislative history, insufficient resources, and sheer physical impossibility, it has been recognized that such statutes cannot be interpreted literally\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [T]hey clearly do not mean that a police officer may not lawfully decline to make an arrest.  As to third parties in these states, the full-enforcement statutes simply have no effect, and their significance is further diminished.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 1\xe2\x80\x934.5, commentary, pp. 1\xe2\x80\x93124 to 1\xe2\x80\x93125 (2d ed. 1980) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, even in the presence of seemingly mandatory legislative commands, is illustrated by <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/41/index.html">527 U. S. 41</a> (1999), which involved an ordinance that said a police officer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall order\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d persons to disperse in certain circumstances, <em>id.,</em> at 47, n.\xc2\xa02.  This Court rejected out of hand the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cthe mandatory language of the ordinance \xe2\x80\xa6 afford[ed] the police <em>no</em> discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 62, n.\xc2\xa032.  It is, the Court proclaimed, simply \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense that <em>all</em> police officers must use some discretion in deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indication from the Colorado Legislature than \xe2\x80\x9cshall use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order\xe2\x80\x9d (or even \xe2\x80\x9cshall arrest \xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6 seek a warrant\xe2\x80\x9d), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(a), (b).  That language is not perceptibly more mandatory than the Colorado statute which has long told municipal chiefs of police that they \xe2\x80\x9cshall pursue and arrest any person fleeing from justice in any part of the state\xe2\x80\x9d and that they \xe2\x80\x9cshall apprehend any person in the act of committing any offense \xe2\x80\xa6 and, forthwith and without any warrant, bring such person before a \xe2\x80\xa6 competent authority for examination and trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93112 (Lexis 2004).  It is hard to imagine that a Colorado peace officer would not have some discretion to determine that\xe2\x80\x94despite probable cause to believe a restraining order has been violated\xe2\x80\x94the circumstances of the violation or the competing duties of that officer or his agency counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The practical necessity for discretion is particularly apparent in a case such as this one, where the suspected violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown.  Cf. <em>Donaldson</em> v. <em>Seattle,</em> 65 Wash. App. 661, 671\xe2\x80\x93672, 831 P.\xc2\xa02d 1098, 1104 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a vast difference between a mandatory duty to arrest [a violator who is on the scene] and a mandatory duty to conduct a follow up investigation [to locate an absent violator]\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  A mandatory duty to investigate would be completely open-ended as to priority, duration and intensity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent correctly points out that, in the specific context of domestic violence, mandatory-arrest statutes have been found in some States to be more mandatory than traditional mandatory-arrest statutes.  <em>Post,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x9313 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The Colorado statute mandating arrest for a domestic-violence offense is different from but related to the one at issue here, and it includes similar though not identical phrasing.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.6(1) (Lexis 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a peace officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that a crime or offense involving domestic violence \xe2\x80\xa6 has been committed, the officer shall, without undue delay, arrest the person suspected of its commission \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even in the domestic-violence context, however, it is unclear how the mandatory-arrest paradigm applies to cases in which the offender is not present to be arrested.  As the dissent explains, <em>post,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and n.\xc2\xa08, much of the impetus for mandatory-arrest statutes and policies derived from the idea that it is better for police officers to arrest the aggressor in a domestic-violence incident than to attempt to mediate the dispute or merely to ask the offender to leave the scene.  Those other options are only available, of course, when the offender is present at the scene.  See Hanna, No Right to Choose: Mandated Victim Participation in Domestic Violence Prosecutions, 109 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1849, 1860 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he clear trend in police practice is to arrest the batterer <em>at the scene</em> \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As one of the cases cited by the dissent, <em>post,</em> at 12, recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be situations when no arrest is possible, <em>such as when the alleged abuser is not in the home</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Donaldson,</em> 65 Wash. App., at 674, 831 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1105 (emphasis added).  That case held that Washington\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory-arrest statute required an arrest only in \xe2\x80\x9ccases where the offender is on the scene,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not create an on-going mandatory duty to conduct an investigation\xe2\x80\x9d to locate the offender.  <em>Id.,</em> at 675, 831 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1105.  Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s restraining-order statute appears to contemplate a similar distinction, providing that when arrest is \xe2\x80\x9cimpractical\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which was likely the case when the whereabouts of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s husband were unknown\xe2\x80\x94the officers\xe2\x80\x99 statutory duty is to \xe2\x80\x9cseek a warrant\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9carrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent does not specify the precise means of enforcement that the Colorado restraining-order statute assertedly mandated\xe2\x80\x94whether her interest lay in having police arrest her husband, having them seek a warrant for his arrest, or having them \xe2\x80\x9cuse every reasonable means, up to and including arrest, to enforce the order\xe2\x80\x99s terms,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 29\xe2\x80\x9330.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Such indeterminacy is not the hallmark of a duty that is mandatory.  Nor can someone be safely deemed \xe2\x80\x9centitled\xe2\x80\x9d to something when the identity of the alleged entitlement is vague.  See <em>Roth,</em> 408 U. S., at 577 (considering whether \xe2\x80\x9ccertain benefits\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9csecure[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by rule or understandings); cf. <em>Natale</em> v. <em>Ridgefield,</em> 170 F.\xc2\xa03d 258, 263 (CA2 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason \xe2\x80\xa6 to restrict the \xe2\x80\x98uncertainty\xe2\x80\x99 that will preclude existence of a federally protectable property interest to the uncertainty that inheres in the exercise of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent, after suggesting various formulations of the entitlement in question,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] ultimately contends that the obligations under the statute were quite precise: either make an arrest or (if that is impractical) seek an arrest warrant, <em>post, </em>at 14.  The problem with this is that the seeking of an arrest warrant would be an entitlement to nothing but procedure\xe2\x80\x94which we have held inadequate even to support standing, see <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a> (1992); much less can it be the basis for a property interest.  See <em>post,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Souter, J., concurring).  After the warrant is sought, it remains within the discretion of a judge whether to grant it, and after it is granted, it remains within the discretion of the police whether and when to execute it.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Respondent would have been assured nothing but the seeking of a warrant.  This is not the sort of \xe2\x80\x9centitlement\xe2\x80\x9d out of which a property interest is created.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the statute could be said to have made enforcement of restraining orders \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d because of the domestic-violence context of the underlying statute, that would not necessarily mean that state law gave <em>respondent</em> an entitlement to <em>enforcement</em> of the mandate.  Making the actions of government employees obligatory can serve various legitimate ends other than the conferral of a benefit on a specific class of people.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Sandin</em> v. <em>Conner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/472/index.html">515 U. S. 472</a>, 482 (1995) (finding no constitutionally protected liberty interest in prison regulations phrased in mandatory terms, in part because \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch guidelines are not set forth solely to benefit the prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d).  The serving of public rather than private ends is the normal course of the criminal law because criminal acts, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides the injury [they do] to individuals, \xe2\x80\xa6 strike at the very being of society; which cannot possibly subsist, where actions of this sort are suffered to escape with impunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 5 (1769); see also <em>Huntington</em> v. <em>Attrill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/146/657/index.html">146 U. S. 657</a>, 668 (1892).  This principle underlies, for example, a Colorado district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to prosecute a domestic assault, even though the victim withdraws her charge.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Cunefare,</em> 102 P.\xc2\xa03d 302, 311\xe2\x80\x93312 (Colo. 2004) (Bender, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, and dissenting in part to the judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alleged interest stems only from a State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>statutory</em> scheme\xe2\x80\x94from a restraining order that was authorized by and tracked precisely the statute on which the Court of Appeals relied.  She does not assert that she has any common-law or contractual entitlement to enforcement.  If she was given a statutory entitlement, we would expect to see some indication of that in the statute itself.  Although Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s statute spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cprotected person[s]\xe2\x80\x9d such as respondent, it did so in connection with matters other than a right to enforcement.  It said that a \xe2\x80\x9cprotected person shall be provided with a copy of [a restraining] order\xe2\x80\x9d when it is issued, \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(a); that a law enforcement agency \xe2\x80\x9cshall make all reasonable efforts to contact the protected party upon the arrest of the restrained person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(d); and that the agency \xe2\x80\x9cshall give [to the protected person] a copy\xe2\x80\x9d of the report it submits to the court that issued the order, \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(e).  Perhaps most importantly, the statute spoke directly to the protected person\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate contempt proceedings against the restrained person if the order [was] issued in a civil action or request the prosecuting attorney to initiate contempt proceedings if the order [was] issued in a criminal action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(7).  The protected person\xe2\x80\x99s express power to \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate\xe2\x80\x9d civil contempt proceedings contrasts tellingly with the mere ability to \xe2\x80\x9crequest\xe2\x80\x9d initiation of criminal contempt proceedings\xe2\x80\x94and even more dramatically with the complete silence about any power to \xe2\x80\x9crequest\xe2\x80\x9d (much less demand) that an arrest be made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The creation of a personal entitlement to something as vague and novel as enforcement of restraining orders cannot \xe2\x80\x9csimply g[o] without saying.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 17, n.\xc2\xa016 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  We conclude that Colorado has not created such an entitlement.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we were to think otherwise concerning the creation of an entitlement by Colorado, it is by no means clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause.  Such a right would not, of course, resemble any traditional conception of property.  Although that alone does not disqualify it from due process protection, as <em>Roth</em> and its progeny show, the right to have a restraining order enforced does not \xe2\x80\x9chave some ascertainable monetary value,\xe2\x80\x9d as even our <em>\xe2\x80\x9cRoth</em>-type property-as-entitlement\xe2\x80\x9d cases have implicitly required.

The Court emphasizes the traditional public focus of law enforcement as reason to doubt that these particular legal requirements to provide police services, however unconditional their form, presuppose enforceable individual rights to a certain level of police protection.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15<f f="Times New Roman">\xe2\x80\x93<f f="Century Schoolbook">16.  The Court also notes that the terms of the Colorado statute involved here recognize and preserve the traditional discretion afforded law enforcement officers.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9315, and n. 8.  Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s claim of a property right thus runs up against police discretion in the face of an individual demand to enforce, and discretion to ignore an individual instruction not to enforce (because, say, of a domestic reconciliation); no one would argue that the beneficiary of a Colorado order like the one here would be authorized to control a court\xe2\x80\x99s contempt power or order the police to refrain from arresting.  These considerations argue against inferring any guarantee of a level of protection or safety that could be understood as the object of a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate claim of entitlement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges</em> v. <em>Roth,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/index.html">408 U. S. 564</a>, 577 (1972), in the nature of property arising under Colorado law.*<footcall num="*">  Consequently, the classic predicate for federal due process protection of interests under state law is missing.</footcall></f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gonzales implicitly recognizes this, when she makes the following argument:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cMs. Gonzales alleges that \xe2\x80\xa6 she was denied the process laid out in the statute.  The police did not consider her request in a timely fashion, but instead repeatedly required her to call the station over several hours.  The statute promised a process by which her restraining order would be given vitality through careful and prompt consideration of an enforcement request \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Denial of that process drained all of the value from her property interest in the restraining order.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe argument is unconventional because the state-law benefit for which it claims federal procedural protection is itself a variety of procedural regulation, a set of rules to be followed by officers exercising the State\xe2\x80\x99s executive power: use all reasonable means to enforce, arrest upon demonstrable probable cause, get a warrant, and so on, see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When her argument is understood as unconventional in this sense, a further reason appears for rejecting its call to apply <em>Roth</em>, a reason that would apply even if the statutory mandates to the police were absolute, leaving the police with no discretion when the beneficiary of a protective order insists upon its enforcement.  The Due Process Clause extends procedural protection to guard against unfair deprivation by state officials of substantive state-law property rights or entitlements; the federal process protects the property created by state law.  But Gonzales claims a property interest in a state-mandated process in and of itself.  This argument is at odds with the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rocess is not an end in itself.  Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Olim</em> v. <em>Wakinekona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/index.html">461 U. S. 238</a>, 250 (1983); see also <em>Doe by Fein</em> v. <em>District of Columbia</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d 861, 868 (CADC 1996) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Doe by Nelson</em> v. <em>Milwaukee County</em>, 903 F.\xc2\xa02d 499, 502\xe2\x80\x93503 (CA7 1990).  In putting to rest the notion that the scope of an otherwise discernible property interest could be limited by related state-law procedures, this Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he categories of substance and procedure are distinct\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98Property\xe2\x80\x99 cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Loudermill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/532/index.html">470 U. S. 532</a>, 541 (1985).  Just as a State cannot diminish a property right, once conferred, by attaching less than generous procedure to its deprivation, <em>ibid.</em>, neither does a State create a property right merely by ordaining beneficial procedure unconnected to some articulable substantive guarantee.  This is not to say that state rules of executive procedure may not provide significant reasons to infer an articulable property right meant to be protected; but it is to say that we have not identified property with procedure as such.  State rules of executive procedure, however important, may be nothing more than rules of executive procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in every instance of property recognized by this Court as calling for federal procedural protection, the property has been distinguishable from the procedural obligations imposed on state officials to protect it.  Whether welfare benefits, <em>Goldberg</em> v. <em>Kelly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/254/index.html">397 U. S. 254</a> (1970), attendance at public schools, <em>Goss</em> v. <em>Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/index.html">419 U.

S. 55</a> (1979), and so on, the property interest recognized in our cases has always existed apart from state procedural protection before the Court has recognized a constitutional claim to protection by federal process.  To accede to Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s argument would therefore work a sea change in the scope of federal due process, for she seeks federal process as a substitute simply for state process.  (And she seeks damages under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, for denial of process to which she claimed a federal right.)  There is no articulable distinction between the object of Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s asserted entitlement and the process she desires in order to protect her entitlement; both amount to certain steps to be taken by the police to protect her family and herself.  Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99s claim would thus take us beyond <em>Roth</em> or any other recognized theory of Fourteenth Amendment due process, by collapsing the distinction between property protected and the process that protects it, and would federalize every mandatory state-law direction to executive officers whose performance on the job can be vitally significant to individuals affected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedural directions involved here are just that.  They presuppose no enforceable substantive entitlement, and <em>Roth</em> does not raise them to federally enforceable status in the name of due process.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*Gonzales does not claim to have a protected liberty interest.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961905">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCASTLE ROCK V.

Neither the tragic facts of the case, nor the importance of according proper deference to law enforcement professionals, should divert our attention from that issue.  That issue is whether the restraining order entered by the Colorado trial court on June 4, 1999, created a \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d interest that is protected from arbitrary deprivation by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is perfectly clear, on the one hand, that neither the Federal Constitution itself, nor any federal statute, granted respondent or her children any individual entitlement to police protection.  See <em>DeShaney </em>v.<em> Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/189/index.html">489 U. S. 189</a> (1989).  Nor, I assume, does any Colorado statute create any such entitlement for the ordinary citizen.  On the other hand, it is equally clear that federal law imposes no impediment to the creation of such an entitlement by Colorado law.  Respondent certainly could have entered into a contract with a private security firm, obligating the firm to provide protection to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s family; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interest in such a contract would unquestionably constitute \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.  If a Colorado statute enacted for her benefit, or a valid order entered by a Colorado judge, created the functional equivalent of such a private contract by granting respondent an entitlement to mandatory individual protection by the local police force, that state-created right would also qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d entitled to constitutional protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not understand the majority to rule out the foregoing propositions, although it does express doubts.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is by no means clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99 interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the majority does not contest, see <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>18, that if respondent did have a cognizable property interest in this case, the deprivation of that interest violated due process.  As the Court notes, respondent has alleged that she presented the police with a copy of the restraining order issued by the Colorado court and requested that it be enforced.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01.  In response, she contends, the officers effectively ignored her.  If these allegations are true, a federal statute, Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U.

For it is certainly <em>plausible</em> to construe \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> arrest,\xe2\x80\x9d Colo.

Far from overlooking the traditional presumption of police discretion, then, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 diligent analysis of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, purpose, and history led it to conclude that the Colorado Legislature intended precisely to abrogate that presumption in the specific context of domestic restraining orders.

First, principles of federalism and comity favor giving a State\xe2\x80\x99s high court the opportunity to answer important questions of state law, particularly when those questions implicate uniquely local matters such as law enforcement and might well require the weighing of policy considerations for their correct resolution.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See<em> Elkins </em>v. <em>Moreno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/647/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/647/index.html">435 U.

See<em> Elkins</em>, 435 U. S., at 661\xe2\x80\x93662 (citing constitutional avoidance as a factor supporting certification).  Third, certification would promote both judicial economy and fairness to the parties.  After all, the Colorado Supreme Court is the ultimate authority on the meaning of Colorado law, and if in later litigation it should disagree with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s provisional state-law holding, our efforts will have been wasted and respondent will have been deprived of the opportunity to have her claims heard under the authoritative view of Colorado law.  The unique facts of this case only serve to emphasize the importance of employing a procedure that will provide the correct answer to the central question of state law.  See <em>Brockett</em>, 472 U. S., at 510 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cSpeculation by a federal court about the meaning of a state statute in the absence of a prior state court adjudication is particularly gratuitous when, as is the case here, the state courts stand willing to address questions of state law on certification from a federal court\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three flaws in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rather superficial analysis of the merits highlight the unwisdom of its decision to answer the state-law question <em>de novo</em>.  First, the Court places undue weight on the various statutes throughout the country that seemingly mandate police enforcement but are generally understood to preserve police discretion.  As a result, the Court gives short shrift to the unique case of \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory arrest\xe2\x80\x9d statutes in the domestic violence context; States passed a wave of these statutes in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s and 1990\xe2\x80\x99s with the unmistakable goal of eliminating police discretion in this area.  Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s formalistic analysis fails to take seriously the fact that the Colorado statute at issue in this case was enacted for the benefit of the narrow class of persons who are beneficiaries of domestic restraining orders, and that the order at issue in this case was specifically intended to provide protection to respondent and her children.  Finally, the Court is simply wrong to assert that a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to provide police enforcement in certain defined circumstances does not resemble any \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional conception of property,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17; in fact, a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s property interest in such a commitment is just as concrete and worthy of protection as her interest in any other important service the government or a private firm has undertaken to provide.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994, the Colorado General Assembly passed omnibus legislation targeting domestic violence.  The part of the legislation at issue in this case mandates enforcement of a domestic restraining order upon probable cause of a violation, \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3), while another part directs that police officers \xe2\x80\x9cshall, without undue delay, arrest\xe2\x80\x9d a suspect upon \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause to believe that a crime or offense of domestic violence has been committed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.6(1).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In adopting this legislation, the Colorado General Assembly joined a nationwide movement of States that took aim at the crisis of police underenforcement in the domestic violence sphere by implementing \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory arrest\xe2\x80\x9d statutes.  The crisis of underenforcement had various causes, not least of which was the perception by police departments and police officers that domestic violence was a private, \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d matter and that arrest was to be used as a last resort.  Sack, Battered Women and the State: The Struggle for the Future of Domestic Violence Policy, 2004 Wis. L. Rev. 1657, 1662\xe2\x80\x931663 (hereinafter Sack); <em>id.</em>, at 1663<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cBecause these cases were considered noncriminal, police assigned domestic violence calls low priority and often did not respond to them for several hours or ignored them altogether\xe2\x80\x9d).  In response to these realities, and emboldened by a well-known 1984 experiment by the Minneapolis police department,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cmany states enacted mandatory arrest statutes under which a police officer must arrest an abuser when the officer has probable cause to believe that a domestic assault has occurred or that a protection order has been violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Developments in the Law: Legal Responses to Domestic Violence, 106 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1498, 1537 (1993).  The purpose of these statutes was precisely to \xe2\x80\x9ccounter police resistance to arrests in domestic violence cases by removing or restricting police officer discretion; mandatory arrest policies would increase police response and reduce batterer recidivism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sack 1670.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, when Colorado passed its statute in 1994, it joined the ranks of 15 States that mandated arrest for domestic violence offenses and 19 States that mandated arrest for domestic restraining order violations.  See Developments in the Law, 106 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 1537, n. 68 (noting statutes in 1993); N. Miller, Institute for Law and Justice, A Law Enforcement and Prosecution Perspective 7, and n. 74, 8, and n. 90 (2003), http://www.ilj.org/dv/dvvawa2000.htm (as visited June 24, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (listing Colorado among the many States that currently have mandatory arrest statutes).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the specific purpose of these statutes, there can be no doubt that the Colorado Legislature used the term \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d advisedly in its domestic restraining order statute.  While \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d is probably best read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in other Colorado statutes that seemingly mandate enforcement, cf. Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93112 (Lexis 2004) (police \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall suppress</em> all riots, disturbances or breaches of the peace, <em>shall apprehend </em>all disorderly persons in the city \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphases added)), it is clear that the elimination of police discretion was integral to Colorado and its fellow States\xe2\x80\x99 solution to the problem of underenforcement in domestic violence cases.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Since the text of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s statute perfectly captures this legislative purpose, it is hard to imagine what the Court has in mind when it insists on \xe2\x80\x9csome stronger indication from the Colorado Legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Colorado case law does not speak to the question, it is instructive that other state courts interpreting their analogous statutes have not only held that they eliminate the police\xe2\x80\x99s traditional discretion to refuse enforcement, but have also recognized that they create rights enforceable against the police under state law.  For example, in <em>Nearing </em>v. <em>Weaver</em>, 295 Ore. 702, 670 P.\xc2\xa02d 137 (1983) (en banc), the court held that although the common law of negligence did not support a suit against the police for failing to enforce a domestic restraining order, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory directive formed the basis for the suit because it was \xe2\x80\x9ca specific duty imposed by statute for the benefit of individuals previously identified by judicial order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 707, 670 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 140.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  In <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Pickett County, </em>996 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 162 (Tenn. 1999) (on certification to the Sixth Circuit), the court confirmed that the statute mandated arrest for violations of domestic restraining orders, and it held that the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic duty\xe2\x80\x9d defense to a negligence action was unavailable to the defendant police officers because the restraining order had created a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial duty\xe2\x80\x9d to protect the plaintiff.  <em>Id.</em>, at 165.  See also <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell</em>, 294 N.\xc2\xa0J. Super. 18, 24, 682 A.\xc2\xa02d 272, 274 (1996) (domestic restraining order statute \xe2\x80\x9callows no discretion\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to arrest; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he duty imposed on the police officer is ministerial\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Seattle</em>, 65 Wash. App. 661, 670, 831 P.\xc2\xa02d 1098, 1103 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, where an officer has legal grounds to make an arrest he has considerable discretion to do so.  In regard to domestic violence, the rule is the reverse.  If the officer has the legal grounds to arrest pursuant to the statute, he has a mandatory duty to make the arrest\xe2\x80\x9d).  To what extent the Colorado Supreme Court would agree with the views of these courts is, of course, an open question, but it does seem rather brazen for the majority to assume that the Colorado Supreme Court would repudiate this consistent line of persuasive authority from other States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Court fails to come to terms with the wave of domestic violence statutes that provides the crucial context for understanding Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s law.  The Court concedes that, \xe2\x80\x9cin the specific context of domestic violence, mandatory-arrest statutes have been found in some States to be more mandatory than traditional mandatory-arrest statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, but that is a serious understatement.  The difference is not a matter of degree, but of kind.  Before this wave of statutes, the legal rule was one of discretion; as the Court shows, the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional,\xe2\x80\x9d general mandatory arrest statutes have always been understood to be \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d in name only, see <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The innovation of the domestic violence statutes was to make police enforcement, not \xe2\x80\x9cmore mandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply <em>mandatory</em>.  If, as the Court says, the existence of a protected \xe2\x80\x9centitlement\xe2\x80\x9d turns on whether \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment officials may grant or deny it in their discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, the new mandatory statutes undeniably create an entitlement to police enforcement of restraining orders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps recognizing this point, the Court glosses over the dispositive question\xe2\x80\x94whether the police enjoyed discretion to deny enforcement\xe2\x80\x94and focuses on a different question\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x9cprecise means of enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, were called for in this case.  But that question is a red herring.  The statute directs that, upon probable cause of a violation, \xe2\x80\x9ca peace officer shall arrest, or, if an arrest would be impractical under the circumstances, seek a warrant for the arrest of a restrained person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(3)(b) (Lexis 1999).  Regardless of whether the enforcement called for in this case was arrest or the seeking of an arrest warrant (the answer to that question probably changed over the course of the night as the respondent gave the police more information about the husband\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts), the crucial point is that, under the statute, the police were <em>required </em>to provide enforcement; <em>they lacked the discretion to do nothing</em>.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Court suggests that the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d may encompass different acts infects any entitlement to enforcement with \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  But this objection is also unfounded.  Our cases have never required the object of an entitlement to be some mechanistic, unitary thing.  Suppose a State entitled every citizen whose income was under a certain level to receive health care at a state clinic.  The provision of health care is not a unitary thing\xe2\x80\x94doctors and administrators must decide what tests are called for and what procedures are required, and these decisions often involve difficult applications of judgment.  But it could not credibly be said that a citizen lacks an entitlement to health care simply because the content of that entitlement is not the same in every given situation.  Similarly, the enforcement of a restraining order is not some amorphous, indeterminate thing.  Under the statute, if the police have probable cause that a violation has occurred, enforcement consists of either making an immediate arrest or seeking a warrant and then executing an arrest\xe2\x80\x94traditional, well-defined tasks that law enforcement officers perform every day.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court similarly errs in speculating that the Colorado Legislature may have mandated police enforcement of restraining orders for \xe2\x80\x9cvarious legitimate ends other than the conferral of a benefit on a specific class of people,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15; see also <em>ibid. </em>(noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cserving of public rather than private ends is the normal course of the criminal law\xe2\x80\x9d).  While the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern would have some bite were we faced with a broadly drawn statute directing, for example, that the police \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall suppress</em> all riots,\xe2\x80\x9d there is little doubt that the statute at issue in this case conferred a benefit \xe2\x80\x9con a specific class of people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, recipients of domestic restraining orders.  Here, respondent applied for and was granted a restraining order from a Colorado trial judge, who found a risk of \xe2\x80\x9cirreparable injury\xe2\x80\x9d and found that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical or emotional harm\xe2\x80\x9d would result if the husband were not excluded from the family home.  366 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent of O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, J.).  As noted earlier, the restraining order required that the husband not \xe2\x80\x9cmolest or disturb\xe2\x80\x9d the peace of respondent and the daughters, and it ordered (with limited exceptions) that the husband stay at least 100 yards away from the family home.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  It also directed the police to \xe2\x80\x9cuse every reasonable means to enforce this \xe2\x80\xa6 order,\xe2\x80\x9d and to arrest or seek a warrant upon probable cause of a violation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1144.

This is an unlikely reading given that the statute was motivated by a profound distrust of police discretion in the domestic violence context and motivated by a desire to improve the protection given to holders of domestic restraining orders.  We do not have the benefit of an authoritative construction of Colorado law, but I would think that if an estranged husband harassed his wife in violation of a restraining order, and then absconded after she called the police, the statute would not only obligate the police to seek an arrest warrant, but also obligate them to execute it by making an arrest.  In any event, under respondent\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, by the time the police were informed of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, an arrest was practical and, under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms, mandatory. </p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court wonders \xe2\x80\x9chow the mandatory-arrest paradigm applies to cases in which the offender is not present to be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Again, questions as to the <em>scope</em> of the obligation to provide enforcement are far afield from the key issue\xe2\x80\x94whether there exists an entitlement to enforcement.  In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s speculations are off-base.  First, this is not a case like <em>Donaldson</em> v. <em>Seattle</em>, 65 Wash. App. 661, 831 P. 2d 1098 (1992), in which the restrained person violated the order and then left the scene.  Here, not only did the husband violate the restraining order by coming within 100 yards of the family home, but he continued to violate the order while his abduction of the daughters persisted.  This is because the restraining order prohibited him from \xe2\x80\x9cmolest[ing] or disturb[ing] the peace\xe2\x80\x9d of the daughters.  See 366 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent of O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, J.).  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cscene\xe2\x80\x9d of the violation was wherever the husband was currently holding the daughters, this case does not implicate the question of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s duties to arrest a person who has left the scene and is no longer in violation of the restraining order.  Second, to the extent that arresting the husband was initially \xe2\x80\x9cimpractical under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d because his whereabouts were unknown, the Colorado statute (unlike some other States\xe2\x80\x99 statutes) expressly addressed that situation\xe2\x80\x94it <em>required</em> the police to seek an arrest warrant.  Third, the Court is wrong to suggest that this case falls outside the core situation that these types of statutes were meant to address.  One of the well-known cases that contributed to the passage of these statutes involved facts similar to this case.  See <em>Sorichetti</em> v. <em>New York City</em>, 65 N. Y. 2d 461, 467, 482 N. E. 2d 70, 74 (1985) (police officers at police station essentially ignored a mother\xe2\x80\x99s pleas for enforcement of a restraining order against an estranged husband who made threats about their 6-year-old daughter; hours later, as the mother persisted in her pleas, the daughter was found mutilated, her father having attacked her with a fork and a knife and attempted to saw off her leg); Note, 1996 U.

And while the analogy to a private security contract need not be precise to be useful, I would point out that the Court is likely incorrect in stating that private security guards could not have arrested the husband under the circumstances, see <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa010.  Because the husband\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing abduction of the daughters would constitute a knowing violation of the restraining order, see n.\xc2\xa013, <em>supra</em>, and therefore a crime under the statute, see \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x93803.5(1), a private person who was at the scene and aware of the circumstances of the abduction would have authority to arrest.

This misunderstands respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Putting aside the inartful passage of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s brief that Justice Souter relies upon, <em>ante</em>, at 2, it is clear that respondent is in fact asserting a substantive interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement of the restraining order.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 10.  Enforcement of a restraining order is a tangible, substantive act.  If an estranged husband violates a restraining order by abducting children, and the police succeed in enforcing the order, the person holding the restraining order has undeniably just received a substantive benefit.  As in other procedural due process cases, respondent is arguing that the police officers failed to follow fair procedures in ascertaining whether the statutory criteria that trigger their obligation to provide enforcement\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, an outstanding order plus probable cause that it is being violated\xe2\x80\x94were satisfied in her case.  Cf. <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Piphus</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/247/index.html">435 U. S. 247</a>, 266\xe2\x80\x93267 (1978) (discussing analytic difference between the denial of fair process and the denial of the substantive benefit itself).  It is Justice Souter, not respondent, who makes the mistake of \xe2\x80\x9ccollapsing the distinction between property protected and the process that protects it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter also errs in suggesting that respondent cannot have a property interest in enforcement because she would not be authorized to instruct the police to refrain from enforcement in the event of a violation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  The right to insist on the provision of a service is separate from the right to refuse the service.  For example, compulsory attendance laws deny minors the right to refuse to attend school.  Nevertheless, we have recognized that minors have a property interest in public education and that school officials must therefore follow fair procedures when they seek to deprive minors of this valuable benefit through suspension.
