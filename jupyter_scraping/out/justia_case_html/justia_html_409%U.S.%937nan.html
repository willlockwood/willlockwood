[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] The exception for indigents was created by Rule 48 of the Supreme Court of Alabama which puts within the court\'s discretion the power to take appeals in cases where the transcript filing is late but within time for taking an appeal. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] Such was the case here. The spirit of the Rule is a generous and progressive one. Although not written to create classes of appellants, the courts have added that feature. The class is defined by wealth. We have held that a class based on wealth is inherently suspect. William v. Illinois, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/235/case.html">399 U.S. 235</a> (1970), Tate v. Short, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/395/case.html">401 U.S. 395</a> (1971), Boddie v. Connecticut, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/case.html">401 U.S. 371</a> (1971), Harper v. Virginia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/663/case.html">383 U.S. 663</a> (1966). And when a suspect classification is made in such a manner as to impair a fundamental right, the burden on the State to prove a compelling state interest is a heavy one. While there is no constitutional right to appeal, a State may not grant appellate review in such a way as to discriminate between those appellants based who are wealthy and those who are poor. Griffin v. Illinois, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html#18">351 U.S. 12, 18</a> (1955). </p><p> Alabama\'s law seems to be out of line with that principle. I would therefore grant the petition and put the case down for oral argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> In Johnson v. Committee on Examinations, 407 U.S. 915, the Court last Term denied a petition for certiorari in a case from Arizona where a white candidate for admission to the Bar claimed discrimination against him as compared with the treatment accorded Black candidates. It seems that the passing grade on Arizona Bar Exam is 70. Petitioner alleged that he got below 70 and was rejected, while these Blacks were admitted whose grades were likewise below 70 and no better than his own. I dissented from the denial of certiorari in that case. Like the present one, it seems to be case of reverse discrimination. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Code of Alabama, Title VII 827(4):</p><ul>\'The Court reporter\'s certified transcript shall be filed with the clerk within sixty days from the date of the taking of the appeal or within sixty days from the date of the court\'s ruling on the motion for a new trial, whichever date is later; and any succinct statement of the evidence made in lieu of such transcript, as authorized in section 827(3) hereof, shall be filed with the clerk within sixty days from the date of the taking of the appeal, or within sixty day from the date of the Court\'s ruling on the motion for a new trial, whichever date is later.
