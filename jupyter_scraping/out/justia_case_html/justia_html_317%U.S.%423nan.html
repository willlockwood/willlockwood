Subsequent to the trial of the case, the Milk Commission of the San Francisco Medical Society determined that nonpasteurized milk could not be certified by it as free from harmful bacteria, and promulgated an order accordingly, effective January 15, 1939.  This fact, which apparently was not called to the attention of the Supreme Court of California, renders moot the federal questions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 317 U. S. 424</a></p><p> raised by appellants, since all milk sold in San Francisco, not certified by the Milk Commission of the Medical Society, is required by the ordinance to be pasteurized, and since appellants do not, by this suit, challenge the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of the pasteurization requirement.  In order that the state court may make proper disposition of the case in the light of the fact that the federal questions cannot be decided here, we vacate the judgment, without costs to either party in this Court, and remand the cause to the Supreme Court of California for such further proceedings as it may deem appropriate.  <em>Florida v.
