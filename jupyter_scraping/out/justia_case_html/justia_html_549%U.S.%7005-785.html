The trial court denied Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s motion to order the family members not to wear the buttons.  The California Court of Appeal upheld Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, stating that he had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on the buttons claim; citing <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Flynn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/560/index.html">475 U.

S. 501</a>, 503\xe2\x80\x93506 (1976); <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Flynn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/560/index.html">475 U. S. 560</a>, 568 (1986).  In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victim\xe2\x80\x99s image worn by the victim\xe2\x80\x99s family during respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial.  We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s estranged wife, Pamela.  At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense.  A California jury rejected Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s trial, several members of Studer\xe2\x80\x99s family sat in the front row of the spectators\xe2\x80\x99 gallery.  On at least some of the trial\xe2\x80\x99s 14 days, some members of Studer\xe2\x80\x99s family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Prior to opening statements, Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial.  The court denied the motion, stating that it saw \xe2\x80\x9cno possible prejudice to the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.  The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <em>Flynn</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test, made clear that it \xe2\x80\x9cconsider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an \xe2\x80\x98impermissible factor coming into play,\xe2\x80\x99 the practice of which should be discouraged.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570).  Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 571, that the buttons had not \xe2\x80\x9cbranded defendant \xe2\x80\x98with an unmistakable mark of guilt\xe2\x80\x99 in the eyes of the jurors\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to \xc2\xa72254.  In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers\xe2\x80\x99 wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial.  The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under \xc2\xa72254 the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladin\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 656\xe2\x80\x93658 (2005).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators\xe2\x80\x99 courtroom conduct.  427 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 657\xe2\x80\x93658 (citing <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley</em>, 918 F.\xc2\xa02d 828 (CA9 1990)).  The Court of Appeals held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.\xe2\x80\x9d  427 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 659\xe2\x80\x93660.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  427 F.\xc2\xa03d 647 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now vacate.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1219:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(d)\xe2\x80\x82An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

In <em>Williams</em>, the Court considered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  425 U.

The Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <em>id.,</em> at 512\xe2\x80\x93513.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Flynn</em>, the Court addressed whether seating \xe2\x80\x9cfour uniformed state troopers\xe2\x80\x9d in the row of spectators\xe2\x80\x99 seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial.  475 U. S., at 562.  The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 571.  In reaching that holding, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question must be \xe2\x80\xa6 whether \xe2\x80\x98an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <em>Williams</em>, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <em>Flynn</em>, the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant.  Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an \xe2\x80\x9cessential state\xe2\x80\x9d policy or interest.  <em>Williams, supra</em>, at 505 (concluding that the practice \xe2\x80\x9cfurther[ed] no essential state policy\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 568\xe2\x80\x93569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an \xe2\x80\x9cessential state interest\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.

Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 830\xe2\x80\x93831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators\xe2\x80\x99 buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416\xe2\x80\x93418, 114 P.\xc2\xa03d 607, 616\xe2\x80\x93617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  <em>Billings</em> v. <em>Polk</em>, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 238, 246\xe2\x80\x93247 (CA4 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThese precedents do not clearly establish that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 07\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x930457\xe2\x80\x93CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *6\xe2\x80\x937 (Tex.

In Part II\xe2\x80\x93B of Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  529 U. S., at 409\xe2\x80\x93413.  In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in<em> Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 390\xe2\x80\x93398.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Strickland</em>, we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death.  466 U. S., at 700.  While our ultimate <em>holding</em> rejected the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <em>dicta</em>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d for over 20 years.  See <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 391.  Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <em>Williams </em>opinion, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor stated that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.  That dictum has been repeated in three subsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court rejected constitutional claims that four of us would have upheld.*<footcall num="*">  Because I am persuaded that Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Virtually every one of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004); <em>Strickland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>; <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966); see also <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  It is quite wrong to invite state court judges to discount the importance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have been strictly necessary as an explanation of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s specific holding in the case.  Cf. <em>County of Allegheny</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 668 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule, the principle of <em>stare decisis</em> directs us to adhere not only to the holdings of our prior cases, but also their explications of the governing rules of law\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Sheet Metal Workers</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/421/index.html">478 U. S. 421</a>, 490 (1986) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough technically dicta, \xe2\x80\xa6 an important part of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for the result that it reache[s] is entitled to greater weight\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  The text of AEDPA itself provides sufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without placing a judicial thumb on the warden\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scales.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in this case are essentially the same as those expressed by Justice Souter, with one caveat.  In my opinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion that the First Amendment may provide some measure of protection to spectators in a courtroom who engage in actual or symbolic speech to express any point of view about an ongoing proceeding.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0See <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  While the ground between criteria entailed by \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d may be murky, it makes sense to regard the standard governing this case as clearly established by this Court.  We have a number of decisions dealing with threats to the fundamental fairness of a criminal trial posed by conditions in (or originating in) the courtroom, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Flynn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/560/index.html">475 U. S. 560</a> (1986); <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/501/index.html">425 U. S. 501</a> (1976);<em> Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/index.html">384 U. S. 333</a> (1966); <em>Estes</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/532/index.html">381 U. S. 532</a> (1965), and the two most recent ones agree on a general formulation harking back to <em>Estes</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 542\xe2\x80\x93546: the question is whether the practice or condition presents \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an unacceptable risk \xe2\x80\xa6 of impermissible factors coming into play\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the case.  <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 505).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s intent to adopt a standard at this general and comprehensive level could not be much clearer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the applicability of this standard, there is no serious question that it reaches the behavior of spectators.  The focus of the later cases is on appearances within the courtroom open to the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 observation.  There is no suggestion in the opinions, and no reason to think now, that it should matter whether the State or an individual may be to blame for some objectionable sight; either way, the trial judge has an affirmative obligation to control the courtroom and keep it free of improper influence.  <em>Sheppard</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 363.  And since the <em>Williams-Flynn</em> standard is a guide for trial judges, not for laypersons without schooling in threats to the fairness of trials, its general formulation is enough to tell trial judges that it applies to the behavior of courtroom visitors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any reasonable doubt about the pertinence of the standard to the practice in question; one could not seriously deny that allowing spectators at a criminal trial to wear visible buttons with the victim\xe2\x80\x99s photo can raise a risk of improper considerations.  The display is no part of the evidence going to guilt or innocence, and the buttons are at once an appeal for sympathy for the victim (and perhaps for those who wear the buttons) and a call for some response from those who see them.  On the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 part, that expected response could well seem to be a verdict of guilty, and a sympathetic urge to assuage the grief or rage of survivors with a conviction would be the paradigm of improper consideration.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only debatable question is whether the risk in a given case reaches the \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d level.  While there is a fair argument that any level of risk from wearing buttons in a courtroom is unacceptable, two considerations keep me from concluding that the state court acted unreasonably in failing to see the issue this way and reverse the conviction.  First, of the several courts that have considered the influence of spectators\xe2\x80\x99 buttons, the majority have left convictions standing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State</em> v. <em>Speed</em>, 265 Kan. 26, 47\xe2\x80\x9348, 961 P.\xc2\xa02d 13, 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (1998);<em> State </em>v. <em>Braxton</em>, 344 N.\xc2\xa0C. 702, 709\xe2\x80\x93710, 477 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 172, 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lord</em>, 128 Wash. App. 216, 219\xe2\x80\x93223, 114 P.\xc2\xa03d 1241, 1243\xe2\x80\x931245 (2005); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>State</em>, 977 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998).  I am wary of assuming that every trial and reviewing judge in those cases was unreasonable as well as mistaken in failing to embrace a no-risk standard, and so I would find it hard to say the state judges were unreasonable in this case, given the lack of detail about the buttons\xe2\x80\x99 display.  Second, an interest in protected expression on the part of the spectators wearing mourners\xe2\x80\x99 buttons has been raised, but not given focus or careful attention in this or any other case that has come to our notice.  Although I do not find such a First Amendment interest intuitively strong here, in the absence of developed argument it would be preferable not to decide whether protection of speech could require acceptance of some risk raised by spectators\xe2\x80\x99 buttons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I think Musladin has not shown the state judge\xe2\x80\x99s application of our law to be unreasonable, and on that ground concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962231">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nCAREY V.

This fundamental principle of due process is well established.  It was recognized in <em>Frank</em> v. <em>Mangum</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/237/309/index.html">237 U. S. 309</a> (1915), though the Court credited the determination of the state court and granted no relief; and it was the square holding in <em>Moore</em> v. <em>Dempsey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/261/86/index.html">261 U. S. 86</a> (1923), though the Court remanded for factfinding rather than for a new trial.  The disruptive presence of the press required reversal in <em>Sheppard</em> v. <em>Maxwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/index.html">384 U. S. 333</a>, 355 (1966), where \xe2\x80\x9cnewsmen took over practically the entire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the trial,\xe2\x80\x9d and <em>Estes</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/532/index.html">381 U. S. 532</a>, 550 (1965), where the presence of cameras distracted jurors throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule against a coercive or intimidating atmosphere at trial exists because \xe2\x80\x9cwe are committed to a government of laws and not of men,\xe2\x80\x9d under which it is \xe2\x80\x9cof the utmost importance that the administration of justice be absolutely fair and orderly,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional safeguards relating to the integrity of the criminal process attend every stage of a criminal proceeding \xe2\x80\xa6 culminating with a trial \xe2\x80\x98in a courtroom presided over by a judge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cox</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/559/index.html">379 U. S. 559</a>, 562 (1965) (quoting <em>Rideau</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/723/index.html">373 U. S. 723</a>, 727 (1963)) (finding a statute did not on its face violate First Amendment rights where it prohibited picketing in courthouses).  Cf. <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/375/index.html">370 U. S. 375</a> (1962); <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/466/index.html">379 U. S. 466</a> (1965).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule settled by these cases requires a court, on either direct or collateral review, to order a new trial when a defendant shows his conviction has been obtained in a trial tainted by an atmosphere of coercion or intimidation similar to that documented in the foregoing cases.  This would seem to be true whether the pressures were from partisans, or, as seems to have been the case in <em>Sheppard</em>, from persons reacting to the drama of the moment who created an environment so raucous that calm deliberation by the judge or jury was likely compromised in a serious way.  If, in a given case, intimidation of this nature was brought about by the wearing of buttons, relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would likely be available even in the absence of a Supreme Court case addressing the wearing of buttons.  While general rules tend to accord courts \xe2\x80\x9cmore leeway \xe2\x80\xa6 in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U. S. 652</a>, 664 (2004) (plurality opinion), AEDPA does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.  Cf. <em>Wright</em> v. <em>West</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/277/index.html">505 U. S. 277</a>, 308\xe2\x80\x93309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us there is no indication the atmosphere at respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial was one of coercion or intimidation to the severe extent demonstrated in the cases just discussed.  The instant case does present the issue whether as a preventative measure, or as a general rule to preserve the calm and dignity of a court, buttons proclaiming a message relevant to the case ought to be prohibited as a matter of course.  That rule has not been clearly established by our cases to date.  It may be that trial judges as a general practice already take careful measures to preserve the decorum of courtrooms, thereby accounting for the lack of guiding precedents on this subject.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all events, it seems to me the case as presented to us here does call for a new rule, perhaps justified as much as a preventative measure as by the urgent needs of the situation.  That rule should be explored in the court system, and then established in this Court before it can be grounds for relief in the procedural posture of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
