A copy of the contract was attached to and made part of the complaint, which alleged that although executed in the name of Sawin, it was in fact the contract of the railroad company, and that Sawin, by signing it, became liable jointly with the company for the performance of its obligations.  The averment was then made that the</p>\n<p>"railroad company, by virtue of said contract, and the said Daniel C.

That the said plaintiffs did not by their said complaint state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and</p>\n<p>2. That said plaintiffs have not by their said complaint stated or shown any right or cause of action against the defendant.</p>\n<p>This motion was overruled, and judgment entered on the verdict.

The case coming here upon writ of error, the only error assigned is the refusal of the court to arrest the judgment.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We think the court below decided correctly.  By the Code of Practice of Arkansas, which was in force when this judgment was rendered, it was provided, that "Where two or more persons are jointly bound by contract, the action thereon may be brought against all or any of them, at the plaintiff\'s option" (sec. 4480, Gantt\'s Dig., 1874), that "judgment may be given for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several defendants" (sec. 4701), and that</p>\n<p>"though all the defendants have been summoned, judgment may be rendered against any of them severally where the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against such defendants if the action had been against them alone"</p>\n<p>(sec. 4704).  This, under the Act of June 1, 1872, 17 Stat. 187, sec. 5; Rev.Stat. 914, furnished a rule of practice for the courts of the United States in that state.  Clearly, in this case, if the action had been brought against Sawin alone, judgment could have been entered against him on this verdict.  He, in his answer, acknowledged his liability upon the contract, which is the foundation of the action, and offered to confess judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 93 U. S. 291</a></p><p> for $2,500.  After that, as between him and the plaintiffs, the only question was one of amount.  Substantial justice has therefore been done between these parties, and by the operation of these remedial provisions of the code, the sacrifice of substance to mere form and mode of proceeding has been prevented.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
