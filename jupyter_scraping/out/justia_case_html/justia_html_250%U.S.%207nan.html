The indictment here was for conspiring to do the various acts charged in the previous case -- that is, the fraudulent fabrication and uttering of the same fictitious bills of lading and the obtaining of money thereon by delivering the same to the Second National Bank of Cincinnati as collateral.  The demurrer which was sustained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 250 U.
