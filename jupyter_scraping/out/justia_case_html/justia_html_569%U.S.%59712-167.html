Complaining that his attorney offered no defensive strategy, but simply advised him to plead guilty, Davila requested new counsel.  A Magistrate Judge held an in camera hearing at which Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the United States, appeared.  At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge told Davila that he would not get another court-appointed attorney and that his best course, given the strength of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case, was to plead guilty.  More than three months later, Davila pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of 33 other charges.  He stated under oath before a U.\xc2\xa0S. District Judge that he had not been forced or pressured to enter the plea, and he did not mention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate Judge.  Prior to sentencing, however, Davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the indictment, asserting that he had entered the plea for a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic\xe2\x80\x9d reason, i.e., to force the Government to acknowledge errors in the indictment.  Finding that Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plea had been knowing and voluntary, the District Judge denied the motion.  Again, Davila said nothing of the in camera hearing conducted by the Magistrate Judge.  On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit, following Circuit precedent, held that the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s violation of Rule 11(c)(1) required automatic vacatur of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea, obviating any need to inquire whether the error was prejudicial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Under Rule 11(h), vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davila\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plead guilty.

Rule 11(h) was added in the 1983 Amendment to make clear that Rule 11 errors are not excepted from Rule 52(a)\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error inquiry.  Rule 52 also states, in subsection (b), that a \xe2\x80\x9cplain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  When Rule 52(a) governs, the prosecution has the burden of showing harmlessness, but when Rule 52(b) controls, the defendant must show that the error affects substantial rights.  See United States v. Vonn, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs clarified in Vonn and United States v. Dominguez Benitez, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 74\n, Rule 11 error may be of the Rule 52(a) type or the Rule 52(b) kind, depending on when the error was raised.  In Vonn, the judge who conducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant, as required by Rule 11(c)(3), that he would have \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to the assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d if he proceeded to trial.  The defendant first objected to the omission on appeal.  This Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca silent defendant has the burden to satisfy [Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s] plain-error rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59.  In Dominguez Benitez, the error first raised on appeal was failure to warn the defendant, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that a plea could not be withdrawn even if the sentence imposed was higher than the plea-bargained sentence recommendation.  The Court again held that Rule 52(b) controlled, and prescribed the standard a defendant silent until appeal must meet to show \xe2\x80\x9cplain error,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for the [Rule 11] error, he would not have entered the plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Here, the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by exhorting Davila to plead guilty.  Davila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1).  He distinguishes plea-colloquy omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt.  The former come into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty, the latter, before a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial.  Nothing in Rule 11\xe2\x80\x99s text, however, indicates that the ban on judicial involvement in plea discussions, if dishonored, demands automatic vacatur without regard to case-specific circumstances.  Nor does the Advisory Committee commentary single out any Rule 11 instruction as more basic than others.  And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRule 11(c)(1) was adopted as a prophylactic measure, not one impelled by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional requirement.  Thus, violation of the Rule does not belong in the highly exceptional category of structural errors\xe2\x80\x94e.g., denial of counsel of choice or denial of a public trial\xe2\x80\x94that trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.  United States v. Marcus, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n, ___.  Instead, in assessing Rule 11 errors, a reviewing court must take account of all that transpired in the trial court.  Had Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea followed soon after the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments, the automatic-vacatur rule would have remained erroneous.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 mistake in that regard, however, might have been inconsequential, for the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s exhortations, if they immediately elicited a plea, would likely have qualified as prejudicial.  Here, however, three months distanced the in camera meeting conducted by the Magistrate Judge from Davila\xe2\x80\x99s appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea after an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, at which Davila had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about matters relating to his plea.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, should not have assessed the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments in isolation.  Instead, it should have considered, in light of the full record, whether it was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments violated Rule 11(c)(1), cut off further consideration.  It did not engage in a full-record assessment of the particular facts of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s case or the case-specific arguments raised by the parties, including the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Davila was not prejudiced by the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments, and Davila\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the extraordinary circumstances his case presents should allow his claim to be judged under Rule 52(a)\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error standard rather than Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s plain-error standard.  The Court decides only that the automatic-vacatur rule is incompatible with Rule 11(h) and leaves all remaining issues to be addressed on remand.

He maintains that he did so because a U. S. Magistrate Judge, at a pre-plea in camera hearing and in flagrant violation of Rule 11(c)(1), told him his best course, given the strength of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case, was to plead guilty.  Three months later, Davila entered a plea on advice of counsel.  The hearing on Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plea, conducted by a U. S. District Judge, complied in all respects with Rule 11.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question presented is whether, as the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held, the violation of Rule 11(c)(1) by the Magistrate Judge warranted automatic vacatur of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.  We hold that Rule 11(h) controls.  Under the inquiry that Rule instructs, vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to Davila\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plead guilty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn May 2009, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Georgia returned a 34-count indictment against respondent Anthony Davila.  The indictment charged that Davila filed over 120 falsified tax returns, receiving over $423,000 from the United States Treasury as a result of his fraudulent scheme.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn January 2010, Davila sent a letter to the District Court expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorney and requesting new counsel.  His attorney, Davila complained, offered no defensive strategy, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98never mentioned a defense at all,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but simply advised that he plead guilty.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In response to Davila\xe2\x80\x99s letter, a U.\xc2\xa0S. Magistrate Judge held an in camera hearing at which Davila and his attorney, but no representative of the United States, appeared.  At the start of the hearing, the Magistrate Judge told Davila that he was free to represent himself, but would not get another court-appointed attorney.  See App. 148.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAddressing Davila\xe2\x80\x99s complaint that his attorney had advised him to plead guilty, the Magistrate Judge told Davila that \xe2\x80\x9coftentimes . . . that is the best advice a lawyer can give his client.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 152.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn view of whatever the Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence in a case might be,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge continued,\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cit might be a good idea for the Defendant to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct[,] to plead guilty[,] and go to sentencing with the best arguments . . . still available [without] wasting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s time, [and] causing the Government to have to spend a bunch of money empanelling a jury to try an open and shut case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs to Davila\xe2\x80\x99s objection that his attorney had given him no options other than pleading guilty, the Magistrate Judge commented: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here may not be a viable defense to these charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 155.  The judge then urged Davila to cooperate in order to gain a downward departure from the sentence indicated by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]ry to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he counseled,\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government, they have all of the marbles in this situation and they can file that . . . motion for [a] downward departure from the guidelines if they want to, you know, and the rules are constructed so that nobody can force them to file that [motion] for you.  The only thing at your disposal that is entirely up to you is the two or three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  That means you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to the cross.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell the probation officer everything you did in this case regardless of how bad it makes you appear to be because that is the way you get that three-level reduction for acceptance, and believe me, Mr. Davila, someone with your criminal history needs a three-level reduction for acceptance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 159\xe2\x80\x93160.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDavila\xe2\x80\x99s Sentencing Guidelines range, the Magistrate Judge said, would \xe2\x80\x9cprobably [be] pretty bad because [his] criminal history score would be so high.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 160.  To reduce his sentencing exposure, the Magistrate Judge suggested, Davila could \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate with the Government in this or in other cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  As the hearing concluded, the judge again cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9cto get the [sentence] reduction for acceptance [of responsibility],\xe2\x80\x9d Davila had to \xe2\x80\x9ccome to the cross\xe2\x80\x9d:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat two- or three-level reduction for acceptance is something that you have the key to and you can ensure that you get that reduction in sentence simply by virtue of being forthcoming and not trying to make yourself look like you really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was going on. . . . You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go [to the cross] and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell it all, Brother, and convince that probation officer that you are being as open and honest with him as you can possibly be because then he will go to the [D]istrict [J]udge and he will say, you know, that Davila guy, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a long criminal history but when we were in there talking about this case he gave it all up so give him the two-level, give him the three-level reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 160\xe2\x80\x93161.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNearly a month after the in camera hearing, Davila filed a motion demanding a speedy trial.

Davila entered his guilty plea before a U.\xc2\xa0S. District Judge six days later.  Under oath, Davila stated that he had not been forced or pressured to plead guilty.  Id., at 122.  Davila did not mention the in camera hearing before the Magistrate Judge, and the record does not indicate whether the District Judge was aware that the pre-plea hearing had taken place.  See id., at 82\xe2\x80\x9399, 115\xe2\x80\x93125.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore he was sentenced, Davila moved to vacate his plea and to dismiss the indictment.  The reason for his plea, Davila asserted, was \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 58.  Aware that the prosecutor had a duty to disclose all information relevant to the court\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether to accept the plea bargain, he stated that his purpose in entering the plea was to force the Government to acknowledge timeframe errors made in the indictment.  Id., at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  By pleading guilty, Davila said, he would make the court aware that the prosecution was \xe2\x80\x9cvindictive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 59.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Judge denied Davila\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  In so ruling, the court observed that, at the plea hearing, Davila had affirmed that he was under no \xe2\x80\x9cpressure, threats, or promises, other than promises [made] by the government in the plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d Id., at 70.  Furthermore, he had been fully advised of his rights and the consequences of his plea.  Id., at 71.  It was therefore clear to the District Judge, who had himself presided at the plea hearing, that Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea \xe2\x80\x9cwas knowing and voluntary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 72.

That review \xe2\x80\x9crevealed an irregularity in the statements of a magistrate judge, made during a hearing prior to Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plea, which appeared to urge [him] to cooperate and be candid about his criminal conduct to obtain favorable sentencing consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 7a.

In response, the Government conceded that those comments violated Rule 11(c)(1).  Even so, the Government urged, given the three-month gap between the comments and the plea, and the fact that a different judge presided over Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plea and sentencing hearings, no adverse effect on Davila\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights could be demonstrated.  Pursuant to Circuit precedent, the appeals court held that the Rule 11(c)(1) violation required automatic vacatur of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.

As the excerpts from the in camera hearing, set out supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, show, there is no room for doubt on that score.  The Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s repeated exhortations to Davila to \xe2\x80\x9ctell it all\xe2\x80\x9d in order to obtain a more favorable sentence, see App. 157\xe2\x80\x93160, were indeed beyond the pale.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDid that misconduct in itself demand vacatur of Davila\xe2\x80\x99s plea, as the Eleventh Circuit held, or, as the Government urges, must a reviewing court consider all that transpired in the trial court in order to assess the impact of the error on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plead guilty?  We hold that the latter inquiry is the one the Rules and our precedent require.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDavila contends that automatic vacatur, while inappropriate for most Rule 11 violations, should attend conduct banned by Rule 11(c)(1).  He distinguishes plea-colloquy omissions, i.e., errors of the kind involved in Vonn and Dominguez Benitez, from pre-plea exhortations to admit guilt.  Plea-colloquy requirements come into play after a defendant has agreed to plead guilty.  The advice and questions now specified in Rules 11(b) and 11(c)(3)(B), Davila observes, are designed to ensure that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea is fully informed and intelligently made.  Errors or omissions in following Rule 11\xe2\x80\x99s plea-colloquy instructions, Davila recognizes, are properly typed procedural, and are therefore properly assessed under the harmless-error instruction of Rule 11(h).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRule 11(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on judicial participation in plea discussions, in contrast, becomes operative before a defendant has decided whether to plead guilty or to stand trial.  The Rule serves a more basic purpose, Davila urges, one \xe2\x80\x9ccentral to the proper functioning of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 18.  Therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedial analysis that applies to violations of . . . procedural provisions does not and should not apply to th[is] distinct class of error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 16.  Violations of Rule 11(c)(1), Davila elaborates, heighten the risk that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea will be coerced or pressured, and not genuinely an exercise of free will.  When a judge conveys his belief that pleading guilty would be to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s advantage, Davila adds, the judge becomes, in effect, a second prosecutor, depriving the defendant of the impartial arbiter to which he is entitled.  \xe2\x80\x9cRule 11(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s bright-line prohibition on judicial exhortations to plead guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d Davila concludes, is \xe2\x80\x9cno mere procedural technicality,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 21, for such exhortations inevitably and incurably infect the ensuing pretrial process.

The prohibition appears in subsection (c), headed \xe2\x80\x9cPlea Agreement Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c).  That subsection affirms that the prosecution and defense attorney (or the defendant when proceeding pro\xc2\xa0se) \xe2\x80\x9cmay discuss and reach a plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 11(c)(1).  Further, Rule 11(c) describes permissible types of plea agreements, see Rule 11(c)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C), and addresses the court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, acceptance, or rejection of a proffered agreement, see Rule 11(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x93(5).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn recommending the disallowance of judicial participation in plea negotiations now contained in subsection (c)(1), the Advisory Committee stressed that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty to avoid antagonizing the judge who would preside at trial.  See Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1974 Note 1420.  But the Committee nowhere suggested that violation of Rule 11(c)(1) is necessarily an error graver than, for example, the error in Dominguez Benitez, i.e., the failure to tell a defendant that the plea would bind him even if the sentence imposed significantly exceeded in length the term of years stated in the plea bargain.  As earlier noted, see supra, at 7, the Committee pointed to commentary describing judicial engagement in plea bargaining as a once \xe2\x80\x9ccommon practice,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and it observed that, in particular cases, questions may arise \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s to what . . . constitute[s] \xe2\x80\x98participation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1974 Note 1420.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, neither Rule 11 itself, nor the Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s commentary on the Rule singles out any instruction as more basic than others.  And Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule).

Errors of this kind include denial of counsel of choice, denial of self-representation, denial of a public trial, and failure to convey to a jury that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Our essential point is that particular facts and circumstances matter.  Three months distanced the in camera meeting with the Magistrate Judge from Davila\xe2\x80\x99s appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea and later sentenced him.  Nothing in the record shows that the District Judge knew of the in camera hearing.  After conducting an exemplary Rule 11 colloquy, the judge inquired: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Davila, has anyone forced or pressured you to plead guilty today?,\xe2\x80\x9d to which Davila responded: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 122.

Rather than automatically vacating Davila\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea because of the Rule 11(c)(1) violation, the Court of Appeals should have considered whether it was reasonably probable that, but for the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s exhortations, Davila would have exercised his right to go to trial.

That is because the text of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(h) says exactly that, in words whose meaning is crystal clear: \xe2\x80\x9cHarmless error. A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect sub-stantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  As the Court recognizes, this rule \xe2\x80\x9ccalls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.
