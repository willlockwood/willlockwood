Today, however, consumers in Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with independent marketers (IMs) that compete with LDCs for retail sales of  natural gas.  Respondents, mainly IMs offering to sell natural gas to Ohio consumers, sued petitioner Ohio Tax Commissioner (Commissioner) in federal court, alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating three tax exemptions Ohio grants exclusively to LDCs.  The court initially held that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit was not blocked by the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining \xe2\x80\x9cthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  Nevertheless, the court dismissed the suit based on the more embracive comity doctrine, which restrains federal courts from entertaining claims that risk disrupting state tax administration, see <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a>.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s TIA holding, but reversed the court\xe2\x80\x99s comity ruling, and remanded for adjudication of the merits.  A footnote in <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Winn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a>, 107, n.\xc2\xa09, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed an expansive reading of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s comity precedents.  The footnote stated that the Court \xe2\x80\x9chas relied upon \xe2\x80\x98principles of comity\xe2\x80\x99 to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Respondents challenged only a few limited exemptions, the Sixth Circuit observed, therefore their success on the merits would not significantly intrude upon Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s administration of its tax system.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Under the comity doctrine, a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s complaint of allegedly discriminatory state taxation, even when framed as a request to increase a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s tax burden, must proceed originally in state court.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The comity doctrine reflects a proper respect for the States and their institutions.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Fair Assessment</em>, 454 U. S., at 112.  Comity\xe2\x80\x99s constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity.  States rely chiefly on taxation to fund their governments\xe2\x80\x99 operations, therefore their tax-enforcement methods should not be interfered with absent strong cause.  See <em>Dows</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 11 Wall. 108, 110.  The TIA was enacted specifically to constrain the issuance of federal injunctions in state-tax cases, see <em>Fair Assessment</em>, 454 U. S., at 129, and is best understood as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation, <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc.</em> v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/582/index.html">515 U. S. 582</a>, 590.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Hibbs</em> does not restrict comity\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  Plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs </em>were Arizona taxpayers who challenged, as violative of the Establishment Clause, a tax credit that allegedly served to support parochial  schools.  Their federal-court suit for declaratory and injunctive relief did not implicate in any way their own tax liability, and the relief they sought would not deplete the State\xe2\x80\x99s treasury.  Rejecting Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s plea that the TIA barred the suit, the Court found that the case was \xe2\x80\x9cnot rationally distinguishable\xe2\x80\x9d from pathmarking civil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained challenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a jurisdictional barrier.  542 U. S.em&gt;., at 93\xe2\x80\x9394, 110\xe2\x80\x93112.  The Court also dispatched Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s comity argument in the footnote that moved the Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s comity-based dismissal.  <em>Id.,</em> at 107, n.\xc2\xa09.  Neither <em>Hibbs</em> nor any other decision of this Court, however, has considered the comity doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s application to cases of the kind presented here.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that state action \xe2\x80\x9cselects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hillsborough</em> v. <em>Cromwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/620/index.html">326 U. S. 620</a>, 623.  When economic legislation does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights, courts generally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative choices demands.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hodel</em> v. <em>Indiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/314/index.html">452 U. S. 314</a>, 331\xe2\x80\x93332.  And \xe2\x80\x9cin taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madden</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/83/index.html">309 U. S. 83</a>, 88.  Of key importance, when unlawful discrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for <em>equal treatment</em>.  How equality is accomplished\xe2\x80\x94by extension or invalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure\xe2\x80\x94is a matter on which the Constitution is silent.  See, <em>e.g., Heckler</em> v. <em>Mathews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/index.html">465 U. S. 728</a>, 740.  On finding unlawful discrimination, courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.  <em>E.g., id.,</em> at 739, n.\xc2\xa05.  With the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a State\xe2\x80\x99s tax measure, generally remands the case, leaving the interim remedial choice to state courts.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McKesson Corp.</em> v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/18/index.html">496 U. S. 18</a>, 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  If lower federal courts were to consider the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the interim remedial determination would be unavailable, for federal tribunals lack authority to remand to state court an action initiated in federal court.  Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA, which generally precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s design.  These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Comity considerations warrant dismissal of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  If Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s scheme is unconstitutional, the Ohio courts are better positioned to determine\xe2\x80\x94unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in\xe2\x80\x94how to comply with the mandate of equal treatment.  See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html">489 U. S. 803</a>, 817\xe2\x80\x93818.  The unelaborated comity footnote in <em>Hibbs</em> does not counsel otherwise.  Hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case, <em>Hibbs </em>was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes.  Plaintiffs there were third parties whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor.  Here, by contrast, the very premise of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.  The <em>Hibbs</em> footnote is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as that case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief sought is unavailing.  Even if their claims had merit, respondents would not be entitled to their preferred remedy.  In <em>Hibbs</em>, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 grievance: invalidation of the tax credit at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0In sum, a confluence of factors in this case, absent in <em>Hibbs</em>, leads to the conclusion that the comity doctrine controls here.  First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.  Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position.  Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options.  Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance by federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(f)\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA effectively superfluous overlooks Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim, in enacting the TIA, to secure the comity doctrine against diminishment.  Comity, moreover, is a prudential doctrine.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the State\xe2\x80\x99s own system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs.</em> v. <em>Hodory</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/471/index.html">431 U.

Relevant to our inquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining \xe2\x80\x9cthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\xe2\x80\x9d  More embracive than the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for relief that risk disrupting state tax administration.  See <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981).  The comity doctrine, we hold, requires that a claim of the kind here presented proceed originally in state court.  In so ruling, we distinguish <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a> (2004), in which the Court held that neither the TIA nor the comity doctrine barred a federal district court from adjudicating an Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit that allegedly funneled public funds to parochial schools.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historically, all natural gas consumers in Ohio purchased gas from the public utility, known as a local distribution company (LDC), serving their geographic area.  In addition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and operate networks of distribution pipelines to transport and deliver gas to consumers.  LDCs offer customers a single, bundled product comprising both gas and delivery.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, consumers in Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with an independent marketer (IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural gas.  IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines; they use LDCs\xe2\x80\x99 pipelines.  When a customer goes with an IM, therefore, she purchases two \xe2\x80\x9cunbundled\xe2\x80\x9d products: gas (from the IM) and delivery (from the LDC).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax purposes. Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions that IMs do not receive.  First, LDCs\xe2\x80\x99 natural gas sales are exempt from sales and use taxes.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75739.02(B)(7) (Lexis Supp. 2010); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75739.021(E), .023(G), .026(F) (Lexis 2008); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75741.02(C), .021(A), .022(A), .023(A) (Lexis 2008).  LDCs owe instead a gross receipts excise tax, \xc2\xa75727.24, which is lower than the sales and use taxes IMs must collect.  Second, LDCs are not subject to the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs\xe2\x80\x99 taxable gross receipts.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010).  Finally, Ohio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales from the gross receipts tax, which IMs must pay when they purchase gas from LDCs.  \xc2\xa75727.33(B)(4) (Lexis 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs-respondents Commerce Energy, Inc., a California corporation, and Interstate Gas Supply, Inc., an Ohio company, are IMs that market and sell natural gas to Ohio consumers. Plaintiff-respondent Gregory Slone is an Ohio citizen who has purchased natural gas from Interstate Gas Supply since 1999. Alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses, Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb635\xe2\x80\x9339, App. 11\xe2\x80\x9313, respondents sued Richard A. Levin, Tax Commissioner of Ohio (Commissioner), in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Invoking that court\xe2\x80\x99s federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331, Complaint \xc2\xb66, App. 3, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating the three tax exemptions LDCs enjoy and ordering the Commissioner to stop \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing and/or enforcing\xe2\x80\x9d the exemptions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Respondents named the Commissioner as sole defendant; they did not extend the litigation to include the LDCs whose tax burden their suit aimed to increase.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the complaint.  The TIA did not block the suit, the District Court initially held, because respondents, like the plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs</em>, were \xe2\x80\x9cthird-parties challenging the constitutionality of [another\xe2\x80\x99s] tax benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d and their requested relief \xe2\x80\x9cwould not disrupt the flow of tax revenue\xe2\x80\x9d to the State.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[d] to exercise jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of comity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 32a.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature, the District Court observed, chose to provide the challenged tax exemptions to LDCs.  Respondents requested relief that would \xe2\x80\x9crequir[e] Ohio to collect taxes which its legislature has not seen fit to impose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such relief, the court said, would draw federal judges into \xe2\x80\x9ca particularly inappropriate involvement in a state\xe2\x80\x99s management of its fiscal operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  A state court, the District Court recognized, could extend the exemptions to IMs, but the TIA proscribed this revenue-reducing relief in federal court.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere there would be two possible remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded, a federal court should not \xe2\x80\x9cimpose its own judgment on the state legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d 1094 (2009).  While agreeing that the TIA did not bar respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit, the Sixth Circuit rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s comity ruling.  A footnote in <em>Hibbs</em>, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive reading\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s comity precedents.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1098.  The footnote stated that the Court \xe2\x80\x9chas relied upon \xe2\x80\x98principles of comity\xe2\x80\x99 to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs</em>, 542 U. S., at 107, n.\xc2\xa09 (citation omitted).  A broad view of the comity cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would render the TIA \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively superfluous,\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9c<em>sub silentio</em> overrule a series of important cases\xe2\x80\x9d presenting challenges to state tax measures.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1099, 1102 (citing <em>Milliken</em> v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/267/index.html">433 U.

Noting that respondents \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge[d] only a few limited exemptions,\xe2\x80\x9d and satisfied, therefore, that \xe2\x80\x9c[respondents\xe2\x80\x99] success would not significantly intrude upon traditional matters of state taxation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sixth Circuit remanded the case for adjudication of the merits.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1102.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing en banc, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\xe2\x80\x932a, the Commissioner petitioned for certiorari.  By then, the First Circuit had joined the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that <em>Hibbs</em> sharply limited the scope of the comity bar.  <em>Coors Brewing Co.</em> v. <em>M\xc3\xa9ndez-Torres</em>, 562 F.\xc2\xa03d 3 (2009).

These organizations could fund attendance at institutions that provided religious instruction or gave admissions preference on the basis of religious affiliation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 95.

That is so because federal tribunals lack authority to remand to the state court system an action initiated in federal court.  Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA; absent certain exceptions, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Department of Employment</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/355/index.html">385 U. S. 355</a>, 357\xe2\x80\x93358 (1966), the Act precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s design.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Comity considerations, as the District Court determined, warrant dismissal of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  Assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that respondents could prevail on the merits of the suit,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the most obvious way to achieve parity would be to reduce respondents\xe2\x80\x99 tax liability.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  A more ambitious solution would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s tax code.  Were a federal court to essay such relief, however, the court would engage in the very interference in state taxation the comity doctrine aims to avoid.  Cf.<em> State Railroad Tax Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/index.html">92 U. S. 575</a>, 614\xe2\x80\x93615 (1876).  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 requested remedy, an order invalidating the exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20\xe2\x80\x9321, may be far from what the Ohio Legislature would have willed.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.  In short, if the Ohio scheme is indeed unconstitutional, surely the Ohio courts are better positioned to determine\xe2\x80\x94unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in\xe2\x80\x94how to comply with the mandate of equal treatment.  See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/803/index.html">489 U. S. 803</a>, 817\xe2\x80\x93818 (1989).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier noted, our unelaborated footnote on comity in <em>Hibbs</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 9, led the Sixth Circuit to conclude that we had diminished the force of that doctrine and made it inapplicable here.  We intended no such consequential ruling.  <em>Hibbs</em> was hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case.  It was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes.  In <em>Hibbs</em>, the charge was state aid in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause; in other cases of the same genre, the attack was on state allocations to maintain racially segregated schools.  See <em>Hibbs</em>, 542 U. S., at 93\xe2\x80\x9394, 110\xe2\x80\x93112.  The plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs</em> were outsiders to the tax expenditure, \xe2\x80\x9cthird parties\xe2\x80\x9d whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor.  In this case, by contrast, the very premise of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.  Unlike the <em>Hibbs</em> plaintiffs, respondents do object to their own tax situation, measured by the allegedly more favorable treatment accorded LDCs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Hibbs</em> held that the TIA did not preclude a federal challenge by a third party who objected to a tax credit received by others, but in no way objected to her own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision.  In context, we clarify, the <em>Hibbs</em> footnote comment on comity is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as the case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity.  The Court, in other words, did not deploy the footnote to recast the comity doctrine; it intended the note to convey only that the Establishment Clause-grounded case cleared both the TIA and comity hurdles.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents steadfastly maintain that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief they seek, <em>i.e.,</em> invalidation of exemptions accorded the LDCs.  But as we just explained, even if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause and equal protection claims had merit, respondents would have no entitlement to their preferred remedy.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.  In <em>Hibbs</em>, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 grievance: invalidation of the credit, which inevitably would increase the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts.  Notably, redress in state court similarly would be limited to an order ending the allegedly impermissible state support for parochial schools.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Because state courts would have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged violation, nothing would be lost in the currency of comity or state autonomy by permitting the <em>Hibbs</em> suit to proceed in a federal forum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Comity, in sum, serves to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthe National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Younger</em>, 401 U. S., at 44.  A confluence of factors in this case, absent in <em>Hibbs</em>, leads us to conclude that the comity doctrine controls here.  First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.  Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position.  Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options.  Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance on the part of federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit expressed concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1099; see <em>id.,</em> at 1102.  This concern overlooks Congress\xe2\x80\x99 point in enacting the TIA.  The Act was passed to plug two large loopholes courts had opened in applying the comity doctrine.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7, and n. 3.  By closing these loopholes, Congress secured the doctrine against diminishment.  Comity, we further note, is a prudential doctrine.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the State\xe2\x80\x99s own system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs.</em> v. <em>Hodory</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/471/index.html">431 U.

State tax agencies are organized to discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the state procedures.  If federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments, state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.  During the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State\xe2\x80\x99s budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.  Moreover, federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perez</em> v. <em>Ledesma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/index.html">401 U.

S. 88</a> (2004), see <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring), I agree that it is not necessary for us to revisit that decision to hold that this case belongs in state court.  As the Court rightly concludes, <em>Hibbs </em>permits not just the application of comity principles to the litigation here, but also application of the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.  I concur only in the judgment because where, as here, the same analysis supports both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional grounds for dismissal (the TIA imposes a jurisdictional bar, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hibbs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 104), the \xe2\x80\x9cproper course\xe2\x80\x9d under our precedents is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  <em>Sinochem Int\xe2\x80\x99l Co.</em> v. <em>Malaysia Int\xe2\x80\x99l Shipping Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/422/index.html">549 U. S. 422</a>, 435 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on federal jurisdiction over certain cases involving state tax issues because federal courts had proved unable to exercise jurisdiction over such cases in the restrained manner that comity requires.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7.  As the Court explains, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to prohibit federal jurisdiction over cases within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope did not disturb that jurisdiction, or the comity principles that guide its exercise, in cases outside the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purview.  See <em>ante, </em>at 78; 1217.  I therefore agree with the Court that nothing in the Act or in <em>Hibbs </em>affects the application of comity principles to cases not covered by the Act.  I disagree that this conclusion moots the need for us to decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the TIA would itself block th[is] suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court posits that because comity is available as a ground for dismissal even where the Act is not, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s application to this case is irrelevant if comity would also support sending the case to state court.  See <em>ante, </em>at 1617.  The Court rests this analysis on our recent holding in <em>Sinochem </em>that a court <em>may</em> dismiss a case on a nonmerits ground such as comity without first resolving an accompanying jurisdictional issue.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1617 (citing 549 U. S., at 425).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Sinochem</em> is misplaced, however, because it confuses the fact that a court <em>may</em> do that with whether, and when, it <em>should</em>.  As <em>Sinochem</em> itself explains, courts should <em>not</em> dismiss cases on nonjurisdictional grounds where \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98involve[s] no arduous inquiry\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and deciding it would not substantially undermine \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U. S., at 436 (quoting <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 587588 (1999)).  In such circumstances, <em>Sinochem</em> reiterates the settled rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper course\xe2\x80\x9d is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  549 U. S., at 436.  That is the proper course here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The TIA prohibits federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over any action that would \xe2\x80\x9csuspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of [a] tax under State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71341.  As the Court appears to agree, see <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa013, this is such a case even under the crabbed construction of the Act in <em>Hibbs</em>, which the Court accurately describes as holding only that the Act does \xe2\x80\x9cnot preclude a federal challenge by a third party who object[s] to a tax credit received by others, but in no way object[s] to her own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1415 (emphasizing that the \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs in <em>Hibbs</em> were outsiders to the tax expenditure, \xe2\x80\x98third parties\xe2\x80\x99 whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is not such a case, because the respondents here are in no sense \xe2\x80\x9coutsiders\xe2\x80\x9d to the revenue-raising state-tax regime they ask the federal courts to restrain.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> see also <em>Hibbs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 104.  Respondents compete with entities who receive tax exemptions under that regime in providing services whose cost is affected by the exemptions.  Respondents thus <em>do</em> object to their own liability in a very real and economically significant way: The liability the state tax regime imposes on them but not on their competitors makes it more difficult for respondents to match or beat their competitors\xe2\x80\x99 prices.  The fact that they raise this objection through the expedient of contesting their competitors\xe2\x80\x99 exemptions is plainly not enough to qualify them as <em>Hibbs</em>-like \xe2\x80\x9coutsiders\xe2\x80\x9d to the state revenue-raising scheme they wish to enjoin.  If it were, application of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional bar would depend on little more than a pleading game.  The Act would bar a federal suit challenging a state tax scheme that requires the challenger to pay more taxes than his competitor if the challenger styles the suit as an objection to his own tax liability, but would not bar the suit if he styles it as an objection to the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s exemption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court appears to agree that even <em>Hibbs </em>does not endorse such a narrow view of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional bar, see <em>ante</em>, at 1415, 17, n.\xc2\xa013, the \xe2\x80\x9cproper course\xe2\x80\x9d is to dismiss this suit under the statute and not reach the comity principles that the Court correctly holds independently support the same result, <em>Sinochem</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 436.  Here, unlike in <em>Sinochem</em>, there is no economy to deciding the case on the nonjurisdictional ground: The same analysis that supports dismissal for comity reasons subjects this case to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional prohibition, even as construed in <em>Hibbs</em>.  Compare<em> ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9317, with <em>Sinochem</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 435\xe2\x80\x93436 (approving dismissal of a suit on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds because dismissal on personal jurisdiction grounds would have required the \xe2\x80\x9cexpense and delay\xe2\x80\x9d of a minitrial on forum contacts).  Given this, I see only one explanation for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss on a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d ground (comity), <em>ante, </em>at 1617, rather than a mandatory one (jurisdiction): The Court wishes to leave the door open to doing in future cases what it did in <em>Hibbs</em>, namely, retain federal jurisdiction over constitutional claims that the Court simply does not believe Congress should have entrusted to state judges under the Act, see 542 U. S., at 113\xe2\x80\x93128 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not a legitimate approach to this important area of the law, see <em>ibid</em>., and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that our civil rights precedents require it does not withstand scrutiny.  If it is indeed true (which it may have been in the civil rights cases) that federal jurisdiction is necessary to ensure a fair forum in which to litigate an allegedly unconstitutional state tax scheme, the Act itself permits federal courts to retain jurisdiction on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9ca plain, speedy and efficient remedy\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be had in state court.  \xc2\xa71341.  But where, as here and in <em>Hibbs</em>, such a remedy can be had in state court, the Court should apply the Act as written.  See 542 U. S., at 113\xe2\x80\x93128 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I believe the Act forbids the approach to federal jurisdiction over state tax issues that the Court adopted in <em>Hibbs</em>, I would not decide this case in a way that leaves the door open to it even if the Court could find a doorstop that accords with, rather than upends, the settled principle that judges presented with multiple nonmerits grounds for dismissal should dismiss on jurisdictional grounds first.  But the tension the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision creates with this settled principle should be enough to convince even those who do not share my view of the TIA that the proper course here is to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction because <em>Hibbs\xe2\x80\x99 </em>construction of the Act applies at most to the type of true third-party suit that <em>Hibbs</em> describes, and thus does not save this case from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional bar.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
