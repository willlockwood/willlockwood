Here, a judge for the District of Kansas authorized nine wiretap Orders as part of a Government investigation of a suspected drug distribution ring in Kansas.  For the most part, the Government intercepted communications from a listening post within Kansas.  But each Order also contained a sentence purporting to authorize interception outside of Kansas.  Based on that authorization, the Government intercepted additional communications from a listening post in Missouri.  Following the investigation, petitioners Los and Roosevelt Dahda were indicted for participating in an illegal drug distribution conspiracy.  They moved to suppress the evidence derived from all the wiretaps under subparagraph (ii) of the wiretap statute\xe2\x80\x99s suppression provision because the language authorizing interception beyond the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction rendered each Order \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(ii).  The Government agreed not to introduce any evidence arising from its Missouri listening post, and the District Court denied the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 motion.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit rejected the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 facial-insufficiency argument on the ground that the challenged language did not implicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 core statutory concerns in enacting the wiretap statute.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because the Orders were not lacking any information that the statute required them to include and would have been sufficient absent the challenged language authorizing interception outside the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction, the Orders were not facially insufficient.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit applied the \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d test from <i>United States</i> v. <i>Giordano</i>,\n\n416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505, and held that subparagraph (ii) applies only where the insufficiency reflects an order\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of\xe2\x80\x9d wiretapping, <i>id.</i>, at 527.  The court identified two such core concerns and concluded that neither applies to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s territorial limitation.  But <i>Giordano</i> involved a different suppression provision\xe2\x80\x94subparagraph (i)\xe2\x80\x94which applies only when a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication was unlawfully intercepted.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(i).  The underlying point of <i>Giordano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>limitation was to help distinguish subparagraph (i) of \xc2\xa72518(10)(a) from subparagraphs (ii) and (iii).  It makes little sense to extend the \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d test to subparagraph (ii) as well.  Subparagraph (ii) therefore does not include a <i>Giordano</i>-like \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0That said, this Court also cannot fully endorse the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute.  The Dahdas read subparagraph (ii) as applying to any legal defect that appears within the four corners of an order.  Clearly, subparagraph (ii) covers at least an order\xe2\x80\x99s failure to include information required by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72518(4)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(e).  But that does not mean that every defect that may conceivably appear in an order results in an insufficiency.  Here, the sentence authorizing interception outside Kansas is surplus.  Its presence is not connected to any other relevant part of the Orders.  Absent the challenged language, every wiretap that produced evidence introduced at the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 trial was properly authorized under the statute.  While the Orders do not specifically list the territorial area where they could lawfully take effect, they clearly set forth the authorizing judge\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94the District of Kansas.  And the statute itself presumptively limits every Order\xe2\x80\x99s scope to the issuing court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.  This interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient\xe2\x80\x9d does not, as the Dahdas contend, produce bizarre results.  Rather, it makes sense of the suppression provision as a whole.

That is to say, we assume the relevant sentence exceeded the judge\xe2\x80\x99s statutory author- ity.  But none of the communications unlawfully inter- cepted outside the judge\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction were intro- duced at trial, so the inclusion of the extra sentence had no significant adverse effect upon the Dahdas.  Because the remainder of each Order was itself legally sufficient, we conclude that the Orders were not \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient\xe2\x80\x9d on their \xe2\x80\x9cface.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>As we just said, the relevant statute permits a judge to issue an order authorizing the Government to intercept wire communications for an initial (but extendable) period of 30 days.  \xc2\xa72518(5).  To obtain that order, the Government must submit an application that describes the particular offense being investigated as well as the type of communications it seeks to intercept; that sets forth the basis for an appropriate finding of \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause\xe2\x80\x9d; that explains why other less intrusive methods are inadequate, have failed, or are too dangerous to try; and that meets other requirements, showing, for example, authorization by a specified governmental official.  \xc2\xa72518(1).  If the judge accepts the application, finds probable cause, and issues an authorizing order, that order must itself contain specified information, including, for example, the identity of the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications are to be intercepted\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9cnature and location of the [relevant] communications facilities\xe2\x80\x9d; a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted\xe2\x80\x9d; a statement of the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular offense\xe2\x80\x9d to which the intercept \xe2\x80\x9crelates\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity of the agency authorized to intercept\xe2\x80\x9d; the iden- tity of the \xe2\x80\x9cperson authorizing the application\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cthe period of time during which\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cinterception is authorized.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72518(4)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(e).</p><p>A judge\xe2\x80\x99s authorizing authority normally extends only within statutorily defined bounds.  The statute specifies that an order can permit the interception of communications \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(3).  (There is an exception allowing interception beyond the judge\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction if the judge authorizes a \xe2\x80\x9cmobile interception device,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>,<i> </i>but the parties now agree that exception does not apply to these Orders.)  The Government here adds (without the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement) that an intercept takes place <i>either </i>where the tapped telephone is located <i>or </i>where the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clistening post\xe2\x80\x9d is located.  See \xc2\xa72510(4) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cintercept\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Petitioners 11; Brief for United States 6.  As so interpreted, the statute generally requires that one or the other or both of these locations must be found within the authorizing judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>B</p><p>In 2011, the Government began investigating a sus- pected drug distribution ring based in Kansas.  It submitted an application asking a federal judge for the District of Kansas to issue nine related wiretap Orders, and the judge issued them.  For present purposes we assume, see <i>infra</i>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, that all nine Orders met all statutory requirements with one exception.  Each Order contained a sentence that read as follows:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cPursuant to Title 18, United States Code \xc2\xa72518(3), it is further Ordered that, in the event TARGET TELEPHONE #1, TARGET TELEPHONE #3 and TARGET TELEPHONE #4, are transported <i>outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court</i>, interception may take place in any other jurisdiction within the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 105 (under seal) (emphasis  added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 97, 114, 123, 132, 140, 149, 158, 166, 174 (Orders containing identical language but targeting different telephones).</p><p>Although they disputed it below, the parties now agree that this sentence could not lawfully allow a wiretap of a phone that was located outside Kansas in instances where the Government\xe2\x80\x99s listening post was also located outside of Kansas.</p><p>Pursuant to these Orders, the Government listened from a listening post within Kansas to conversations on mobile phones that were located within Kansas and conversations on mobile phones that were located outside of Kansas.  But, in one instance, the Government listened from a listening post <i>outside</i> of Kansas (in Missouri) to conversations on a mobile phone that was also outside of Kansas (in California).  That one instance concerned a mobile phone (Target Telephone #7) belonging to Philip Alarcon.</p><p>In 2012, the Government indicted the Dahdas and several others, charging them with conspiracy to buy illegal drugs in California and sell them in Kansas.  Prior to trial, the Dahdas moved to suppress all evidence derived from the wiretaps authorized by the nine Orders on the ground that the District Court could not authorize the interception of calls from the Missouri listening post to and from Alarcon\xe2\x80\x99s mobile phone in California.  In its response, the Government said it would not introduce any evidence arising from its Missouri listening post.  A Magistrate Judge and subsequently the District Court denied the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 suppression motion.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a\xe2\x80\x9376a.</p><p>The Dahdas appealed.  They argued that, even though the Government did not use any wiretap information from the Missouri listening post, the court should have suppressed all evidence derived from any of the Orders.  That, they said, is because each Order was \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face\xe2\x80\x9d given the extra sentence authorizing interception outside Kansas.  Hence the second subparagraph of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s suppression provision required the evidence to be suppressed.  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(ii).</p><p>The U.\xc2\xa0S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected this argument on the ground that the claimed insuffi- ciency concerned the statute\xe2\x80\x99s territorial requirement.  853 F.\xc2\xa03d 1101, 1114\xe2\x80\x931116 (2017).  That requirement, in its view, did not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98implemen[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 core statutory concerns in enacting the wiretap statute.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1114<i> </i>(quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Giordano</i>,416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505, 527 (1974)).  And for that reason a violation of the territorial requirement did not warrant suppression.  See also 852 F.\xc2\xa03d 1282, 1290 (2017).</p><p>The Dahdas filed a petition for certiorari, seeking review of the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  And, in light of different related holdings among the Circuits, we granted that petition.  Compare 853 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1114\xe2\x80\x931116 (suppression was not required for orders authorizing suppression beyond the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction), and <i>Adams</i> v. <i>Lankford</i>, 788 F.\xc2\xa02d 1493, 1500 (CA11 1986) (same), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Glover</i>, 736 F. 3d 509, 515 (CADC 2013) (suppression required for territorial defect).</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>The question before us concerns the interpretation of the suppression provision\xe2\x80\x99s second subparagraph, which requires suppression where a wiretap order is \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(ii).  The Dahdas ask us to read subparagraph (ii) as applying to any legal defect that appears within the four corners of the order.  The Government replies that the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 approach would require suppression of evidence of serious criminal behavior due to the most minor of technical failures, including those that have little or no relation to any statutory objective.</p><p>The Tenth Circuit, agreeing with the Government, held that subparagraph (ii) applies only where the \xe2\x80\x9cinsuffi- ciency\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes an order\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98statutory requiremen[t] that directly and substantially implement[s] the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  853 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1114 (quoting <i>Giordano</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 527; second alteration in original).  The court identified two such core concerns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98(1) protecting the privacy of wire and oral communications, and (2) delineating on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and concluded that neither applies to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s territorial limitation.  853 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1114 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 90\xe2\x80\x931097, p.\xc2\xa066 (1986)).</p><p>Like the Dahdas, we believe that the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of this provision is too narrow.  The Tenth Circuit took the test it applied from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Giordano</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 527.  But <i>Giordano</i> involved a different provision.  Keep in mind that the statute sets forth three grounds for suppression:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted;</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) the order of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or </p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a).</p><p><i>Giordano</i> focused not, as here, on the second subparagraph but on the first subparagraph, which calls for the suppression of \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully intercepted\xe2\x80\x9d communications.</p><p>In <i>Giordano</i>, a criminal defendant sought suppression of wiretap-gathered information on the ground that the wiretap application was unlawfully authorized.  416 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 525.  A provision of the wiretap statute that has since been amended required an application to be approved by either the Attorney General or a designated Assistant Attorney General.  See18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72516(1) (1970 ed.).  But, in Giordano\xe2\x80\x99s case, an executive assistant to the Assistant Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94not the Assistant Attorney General himself\xe2\x80\x94had approved the application.  416 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 510.</p><p>The Government argued that this statutory violation did not violate the first subparagraph, <i>i.e.,</i> it did not lead to an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfu[l] intercept[ion],\xe2\x80\x9d18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(i), because that subparagraph covers only violations of the Constitution, not statutes.  <i>Giordano</i>, 416 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 525\xe2\x80\x93526.  Otherwise, the Government added, subparagraphs (ii) and (iii)\xe2\x80\x94which clearly cover some statutory violations\xe2\x80\x94would be superfluous.  <i>Id., </i>at 526.  But this Court held that the first subparagraph <i>did</i> cover certain statu- tory violations, namely, violations of those statutory provisions that \xe2\x80\x9cimplemented\xe2\x80\x9d the wiretap-related congres- sional concerns the Tenth Circuit mentioned in its opinion.  <i>Id., </i>at 527.  So construed, the suppression provision left room for the second and third subparagraphs to have separate legal force.  The Court went on to hold that a violation of the approval-by-the-Attorney-General provision implicated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 core concerns.  Subparagraph (i) thus covered that particular statutory provision.  And, finding the provision violated, it ordered the wiretap evidence suppressed.  <i>Id., </i>at 527\xe2\x80\x93528.</p><p>Here, by contrast, we focus upon subparagraph (ii), which requires suppression when an order is facially insufficient.  And in respect to this subparagraph, we can find no good reason for applying <i>Giordano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s test.  The underlying point of <i>Giordano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s limitation was to help give independent meaning to each of \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)\xe2\x80\x99s subparagraphs.  It thus makes little sense to extend the core concerns test to subparagraph (ii) as well.  Doing so would \xe2\x80\x9cactually treat that subparagraph as \xe2\x80\x98surplusage\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94precisely what [this] Court tried to avoid in <i>Giordano</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Glover</i>, 736 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 514.  We consequently conclude that subparagraph (ii) does not contain a <i>Giordano-</i>like \xe2\x80\x9ccore concerns\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  The statute means what it says.  That is to say, subparagraph (ii) applies where an order is \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(ii).</p><p>B</p><p>Although we believe the Tenth Circuit erred in applying <i>Giordano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s core concerns test to subparagraph (ii),<i> </i>we cannot fully endorse the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the statute either.  In our view, subparagraph (ii) does not cover each and every error that appears in an otherwise sufficient order.  It is clear that subparagraph (ii) covers at least an order\xe2\x80\x99s failure to include information that \xc2\xa72518(4) specifically requires the order to contain.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72518(4)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(e) (requiring an order to specify, <i>e.g.,</i> the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity of the person, if known, whose communications are to be intercepted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it relates\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States 17.  An order lacking that information would deviate from the uniform authorizing requirements that Congress explicitly set forth, while also falling literally within the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>But the Dahdas would have us go further and conclude that any defect that may appear on an order\xe2\x80\x99s face would render it insufficient.  The lower courts in various contexts have debated just which kinds of defects subparagraph (ii) covers.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Moore</i>, 41 F.\xc2\xa03d 370, 375\xe2\x80\x93376 (CA8 1994) (order missing judge\xe2\x80\x99s signature); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Joseph</i>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 1068, 1070 (CA5 1975) (order identifying the wrong Government official as authorizing the application); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vigi</i>, 515 F.\xc2\xa02d 290, 293 (CA6 1975) (same).  We need not, however, resolve the questions that these many different cases raise.  We need only determine whether the defects in the Orders before us render them \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that they do not.</p><p>We rest that conclusion upon an argument that the Government did not make below but which it did set forth in its response to the petition for certiorari and at the beginning of its brief on the merits.  That argument is closely related to the arguments the Government did  make below.  It has been fully briefed by both sides.  And as we may \xe2\x80\x9caffir[m]\xe2\x80\x9d a lower court judgment \xe2\x80\x9con any ground permitted by the law and the record,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Murr</i> v. <i>Wis- consin</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 19), we see little to be gained by remanding this litigation for further consideration.</p><p>The argument is simply this: Subparagraph (ii) refers to an order that is \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  An order is \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it is \xe2\x80\x9cdeficient\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clacking in what is necessary or requisite.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 Oxford English Dictionary 359 (1933); accord, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1288 (2d ed. 1957).  And, looking, as the Dahdas urge us to do, at \xe2\x80\x9cthe four corners of the order itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 4, we cannot find any respect in which the Orders are deficient or lacking in anything necessary or requisite.</p><p>The Orders do contain a defect, namely, the sentence authorizing interception outside Kansas, which we set forth above.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  But not every defect results in an insufficiency.  In that sentence, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cfurther\xe2\x80\x9d ordered that interception may take place \xe2\x80\x9coutside the territorial jurisdiction of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 97.  The sentence is without legal effect because, as the parties agree, the Orders could not legally authorize a wiretap outside the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  But, more importantly, the sentence itself is surplus.  Its presence is not connected to any other relevant part of the Orders.  Were we to remove the sentence from the Orders, they would then properly authorize wiretaps within the authorizing court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.  As we discussed above, a listening post within the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction could lawfully intercept communications made to or from telephones located within Kansas or outside Kansas.  See <i>supra</i>, at 3.  Consequently, every wiretap that produced evidence introduced at the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 trial was properly authorized under the statute.</p><p>The Dahdas argue that, without the offending sentence, the Orders are \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient\xe2\x80\x9d because they then do not specifically list the territorial area where they could lawfully take effect.  Reply Brief 6.  The Orders, however, clearly set forth the authorizing judge\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction: the \xe2\x80\x9cDistrict of Kansas.\xe2\x80\x9d  See App. 100.  And the statute itself presumptively limits every Order\xe2\x80\x99s scope to the issuing court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction.  See \xc2\xa72518(3).  We consequently fail to see how the additional language here at issue could render the Orders facially insufficient.</p><p>The Dahdas add that interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient\xe2\x80\x9d as we have just done will produce \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre results.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 5.  They claim that, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s logic, an order authorizing interception for 180 days would not be facially insufficient even though the wiretap statute expressly limits the maximum duration of a wiretap order to 30 days.  \xc2\xa72518(5).  To be sure, a 180-day order may raise problems that the language at issue here does not.  On the one hand, it may be argued that such an order would be facially insufficient because without the 180-day provision the order would not contain any time limit at all.  See \xc2\xa72518(4)(e).  On the other hand, one might argue that such an order merely would be overly broad\xe2\x80\x94not facially insufficient\xe2\x80\x94and that suppression would be warranted only for those communications unlawfully intercepted after 30 days.  See \xc2\xa72518(10)(a)(i).</p><p>Regardless, we need not now address the Dahdas\xe2\x80\x99 180-day hypothetical.  It is enough to say that the problems that may be associated with such an order are not present in this litigation.  Here, the Orders would have been sufficient even if they lacked the language authorizing interception outside Kansas.  And the Dahdas cannot seek suppression under subparagraph (i) given that the unlawfully intercepted communications from the Missouri listening post were not introduced at trial.</p><p>Our interpretation of subparagraph (ii) makes sense of the suppression provision as a whole.  Where the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of a wiretap is unconstitutional or violates a statutory provision that reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 core concerns, an aggrieved person may suppress improperly acquired evidence under subparagraph (i) (as \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully intercepted,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>Giordano</i>, 416 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 527).  Where an order lacks information that the wiretap statute requires it to include, an aggrieved person may suppress the fruits of the order under subparagraph (ii) (as \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient on its face\xe2\x80\x9d).  And where the Government fails to comply with conditions set forth in the authorizing order, an aggrieved person may suppress its fruits under subparagraph (iii) (as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterception .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>For these reasons, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
