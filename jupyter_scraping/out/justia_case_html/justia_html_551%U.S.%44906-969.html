S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2), which BCRA defines as any broadcast that refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction where that candidate is running, \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A).  In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

The Court concluded there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204\xe2\x80\x93205, 206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 26, 2004, appellee Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), began broadcasting advertisements declaring that a group of Senators was filibustering to delay and block federal judicial nominees and telling voters to contact Wisconsin Senators Feingold and Kohl to urge them to oppose the filibuster.  WRTL planned to run the ads throughout August 2004 and finance them with its general treasury funds.  Recognizing, however, that as of August 15, 30 days before the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under BCRA \xc2\xa7203, but believing that it nonetheless had a First Amendment right to broadcast them, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the three ads in question, as well as any materially similar ads WRTL might run in the future.  Just before the BCRA blackout, the three-judge District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that \xc2\xa7203 was not facially overbroad left no room for such \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied\xe2\x80\x9d challenges.  WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period, and the court subsequently dismissed the complaint.  This Court vacated that judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdid not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7203.  <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>(<em>WRTL I</em>), <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/410/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/410/index.html">546 U. S. 410</a>, 412.  On remand, the District Court granted WRTL summary judgment, holding \xc2\xa7203 unconstitutional as applied to the three ads.  The court first found that adjudication was not barred by mootness because the controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review.  On the merits, it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads,<em> not</em> express advocacy or its \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>McConnell, </em>and held that no compelling interest justified BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of such ads.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 195, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases.  The FEC argues that the cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL neither asserts a continuing interest in running its ads nor identifies any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.  These cases, however, fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  That exception applies where \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/1/index.html">523 U. S. 1</a>, 17.  Both circumstances are present here.  First, it would be unreasonable to expect that WRTL could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time to air its ads during the BCRA blackout periods.  Indeed, <em>two </em>BCRA blackout periods have passed during the pendency of this action.  Second, there exists a reasonable expectation that the same \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d involving the same party will recur: WRTL has credibly claimed that it plans to run materially similar targeted ads during future blackout periods, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will refrain from prosecuting future BCRA violations.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito, concluded that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads at issue in these cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9329.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The speech at issue is not the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express campaign speech.  Pp.  10\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Appellants are wrong in arguing that WRTL has the burden of demonstrating that \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional.  Because \xc2\xa7203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny, see, <em>e.g., McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205, under which the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, see <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 786.  Given that <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206, already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent, the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s burden is not onerous insofar as these ads fit this description.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s contention, <em>McConnell, </em>540 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206, did not establish an intent-and-effect test for determining if a particular ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Indeed, <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test for future as-applied challenges, but simply grounded its analysis in the evidentiary record, which included two key studies that separated ads based on whether they were intended to, or had the effect of, supporting candidates for federal office.  <em>Id.,</em> at 308\xe2\x80\x93309.  More importantly, <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 14, 43\xe2\x80\x9344, rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point\xe2\x80\x94or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore fall outside <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  To safeguard freedom of speech on public issues, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA \xc2\xa7203 must be objective, focusing on the communication\xe2\x80\x99s substance rather than on amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See <em>Buckley, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 43\xe2\x80\x9344. <em> </em>It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.  See <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/113/index.html">539 U. S. 113</a>, 119.  And it must eschew \xe2\x80\x9cthe open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cinvit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/527/index.html">513 U. S. 527</a>, 547.  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 269\xe2\x80\x93270.  In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy under this test.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: They focus and take a position on a legislative issue and exhort the public to adopt that position and to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: They do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they take no position on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s speech, BCRA \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  The section can be constitutionally applied only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.  <em>E.g., McConnell, supra</em>, at 205.  None of the interests that might justify regulating WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are sufficiently compelling.  Although the Court has long recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d in election campaigns, <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45, it has invoked this interest as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits, <em>id.,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, and suggested that it might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> posing the same dangers as large contributions, <em>id.,</em> at 45.  <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest to ads that were the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204\xe2\x80\x93206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Issue ads like WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s are not equivalent to contributions, and the corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  A second possible compelling interest lies in addressing \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, 660.  <em>McConnell</em> held that this interest justifies regulating the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of campaign speech, 540 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  This interest cannot be extended further to apply to genuine issue ads like WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s, see,<em> e.g., id.,</em> at 206, n. 88, because doing so would call into question this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of this point by holding \xc2\xa7203 susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412.  Pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0These cases present no occasion to revisit <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban\xe2\x80\x94the question here\xe2\x80\x94the Court should give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  Pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas, agreed that the Court has jurisdiction in these cases and concurred in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment because he would overrule that part of <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>, upholding \xc2\xa7203(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The pertinent case law begins with <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, in which the Court held, <em>inter alia,</em> that a federal limitation on campaign expenditures not made in coordination with a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign (contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)) was unconstitutional, <em>id.</em>, at 39\xe2\x80\x9351.  In light of vagueness concerns, the Court narrowly construed the independent-expenditure provision to cover only express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office by use of such magic words \xe2\x80\x9cas \xe2\x80\x98vote for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98elect,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98vote against,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98defeat,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98reject.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 44, and n. 52.  This narrowing construction excluded so-called \xe2\x80\x9cissue advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d referring to a clearly identified candidate\xe2\x80\x99s position on an issue, but not expressly advocating his election or defeat.  Even as narrowly construed, however, the Court struck the provision down.  <em>Id.</em>, at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Despite <em>Buckley,</em> some argued that independent expenditures <em>by corporations</em> should be treated differently.  A post-<em>Buckley</em> case, <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 776\xe2\x80\x93777, struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a state statute prohibiting corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum.  The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, upholding state restrictions on corporations\xe2\x80\x99 independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates for state office, <em>id.</em>, at 654\xe2\x80\x93655.  <em>Austin</em> was wrongly decided, but at least it was limited to express advocacy.  <em>Nonexpress</em> advocacy was presumed to remain protected under <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti, </em>even when engaged in by corporations, until <em>McConnell</em>.  <em>McConnell</em> held, <em>inter alia,</em> that the compelling governmental interest supporting restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s perceived \xe2\x80\x9ccorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x94also justified extending those restrictions to ads run during the BCRA blackout period \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent \xe2\x80\xa6 [they] are <em>the functional equivalent of express advocacy,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 206 (emphasis added).  <em>McConnell</em> upheld BCRA \xc2\xa7203(a) against a facial challenge.  Subsequently, in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/410/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/410/index.html">546 U. S. 410</a>, 411\xe2\x80\x93412, the Court held that <em>McConnell</em> did not foreclose as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0<em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding concerning \xc2\xa7203 was wrong.  The answer to whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious standard is <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s, which asks whether an ad is the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent of express advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 206.  The fundamental and inescapable problem with this test, with the principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation standard, and with other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental First Amendment rights at issue.  <em>Buckley</em> itself compelled the conclusion that such tests fall short when it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  The only plausible explanation for <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chighly strained\xe2\x80\x9d reading of FECA, <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 280, is that the Court there eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s text and more effective at capturing campaign speech <em>because those tests were all too vague</em>.  If <em>Buckley</em> foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by \xc2\xa7203 that \xc2\xa7203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  Thus, <em>McConnell </em>(which presupposed the availability of as-applied challenges)<em> </em>was mistaken.

In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204\xe2\x80\x93205, 206.

The Court nonetheless determined that \xc2\xa7203 was not facially overbroad.  Even assuming \xc2\xa7203 \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit[ed] some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to carry their \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d of establishing that <em>all </em>enforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left \xe2\x80\x9cno room\xe2\x80\x9d for as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203.  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.

Resolving it requires us first to determine whether the speech at issue is the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or instead a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issue a[d].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206, and n.\xc2\xa088. <em> </em>We have long recognized that the distinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy \xe2\x80\x9cmay often dissolve in practical application.

We further conclude that the interests held to justify restricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not justify restricting issue advocacy, and accordingly we hold that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional as applied to the advertisements at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to BCRA, corporations were free under federal law to use independent expenditures to engage in political speech so long as that speech did not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate.

See note following 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437h (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284.  WRTL alleged that BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in the Act is unconstitutional as applied to \xe2\x80\x9cWedding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLoan,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of \xe2\x80\x98as applied\xe2\x80\x99 challenge WRTL propounds before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a\xe2\x80\x9348a (\xe2\x80\x9cWRTL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to BCRA [\xc2\xa7203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdid not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges\xe2\x80\x9d to BCRA \xc2\xa7203, and remanded \xe2\x80\x9cfor the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied challenge in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA \xc2\xa7203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office\xe2\x80\x94and the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of such advocacy.  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to \xe2\x80\x9clanguage within the four corners\xe2\x80\x9d of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issue ads.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 205\xe2\x80\x93208.  Then, reaching a question \xe2\x80\x9cleft open in <em>McConnell</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208\xe2\x80\x93210.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One judge dissented, contending that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain facial analysis of the text in WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 advertisements\xe2\x80\x9d ignored \xe2\x80\x9cthe context in which the text was developed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge\xe2\x80\x99s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed \xe2\x80\x9cdeep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads\xe2\x80\x9d such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.  We consolidated the two appeals and set the matter for briefing and argument, postponing further consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  549 U.

[I]t is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Continental Bank Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/472/index.html">494 U. S. 472</a>, 477 (1990).  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the District Court concluded, however, these cases fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  See <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 109 (1983); <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co.</em> v. <em>ICC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/219/498/index.html">219 U. S. 498</a>, 515 (1911).  The exception applies where \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/1/index.html">523 U. S. 1</a>, 17 (1998) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Both circumstances are present here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the District Court found, it would be \xe2\x80\x9centirely unreasonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time for it to air its ads\xe2\x80\x9d during the BCRA blackout periods.  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 202.  The FEC contends that the 2-year window between elections provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights before each BCRA blackout period.  But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.  In any event, despite BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s command that the cases be expedited \xe2\x80\x9cto the greatest possible extent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U.

We have recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capable of repetition, yet evading review\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are \xe2\x80\x98as applied\xe2\x80\x99 challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/index.html">415 U.

Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 203, n.\xc2\xa015, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.

Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been \xe2\x80\x9ctargeted to the relevant electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d see 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(C) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions to the term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the First Amendment for BCRA \xc2\xa7203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants contend that WRTL should be required to demonstrate that BCRA is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  Reply Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93970, p.\xc2\xa05, n.\xc2\xa04; Brief for Appellant FEC 34.  After all, appellants reason, <em>McConnell</em> already held that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 was facially valid.  These cases, however, present the separate question whether \xc2\xa7203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA \xc2\xa7203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em> </em>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, 658 (1990); <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em> </em>424 U. S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions and have that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>540 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted \xe2\x80\x9cthe central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked \xe2\x80\x9cstudent coders\xe2\x80\x9d to separate ads based on whether the students thought the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the ad was \xe2\x80\x9cto provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 308\xe2\x80\x93309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of \xc2\xa7203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not \xe2\x80\x9ccarried their heavy burden of proving\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa7203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the First Amendment from that which may be banned.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, this Court in <em>Buckley</em> had already rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates.  See 424 U. S., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of intent and of effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would afford \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no security for free discussion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/516/index.html">323 U. S. 516</a>, 535 (1945)).  It therefore rejected such an approach, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point\xe2\x80\x94or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise First Amendment rights.  The test should also \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] our \xe2\x80\x98profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 270 (1964)).  A test turning on the intent of the speaker does not remotely fit the bill.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Far from serving the values the First Amendment is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of \xc2\xa7203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.  An intent-based standard \xe2\x80\x9cblankets with uncertainty whatever may be said,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coffers no security for free discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2005, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931581, p. 39.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A test focused on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s intent could lead to the bizarre result that identical ads aired at the same time could be protected speech for one speaker, while leading to criminal penalties for another.  See M. Redish, Money Talks: Speech, Economic Power, and the Values of Democracy 91 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder well-accepted First Amendment doctrine, a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s motivation is entirely irrelevant to the question of constitutional protection\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U. S. 415</a>, 433 (1963).  An intent test provides none.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley </em>also explains the flaws of a test based on the actual effect speech will have on an election or on a particular segment of the target audience.  Such a test \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98puts the speaker \xe2\x80\xa6 wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 43.  It would also typically lead to a burdensome, expert-driven inquiry, with an indeterminate result.  Litigation on such a standard may or may not accurately predict electoral effects, but it will unquestionably chill a substantial amount of political speech.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe freedom of speech \xe2\x80\xa6 guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S., at 776 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Public Serv.

To safeguard this liberty, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA \xc2\xa7203 must be objective, focusing on the substance of the communication rather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra, </em>at 43\xe2\x80\x9344. <em> </em>It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.  See <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/113/index.html">539 U. S. 113</a>, 119 (2003).  And it must eschew \xe2\x80\x9cthe open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cinvit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/527/index.html">513 U. S. 527</a>, 547 (1995).  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 269\xe2\x80\x93270.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by \xc2\xa7203 that includes \xe2\x80\x9can appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.  Brief for Appellant FEC 31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et\xc2\xa0al<em>. </em>in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93970, pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9323 (hereinafter McCain Brief).  We do not agree.  To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et\xc2\xa0al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B\xe2\x80\x933.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad\xe2\x80\x99s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose\xe2\x80\x94uninvited by the ad\xe2\x80\x94to factor it into their voting decisions.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statements \xe2\x80\x9cthat the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em> </em>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers \xe2\x80\x9cwould seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em> </em>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are \xe2\x80\x9csubtl[e],\xe2\x80\x9d focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This \xe2\x80\x9cheads I win, tails you lose\xe2\x80\x9d approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate First Amendment protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 206, n.\xc2\xa088.  Under appellants\xe2\x80\x99 view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period\xe2\x80\x94it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking beyond the content of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual\xe2\x80\x9d factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be\xe2\x80\x94WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA \xc2\xa7203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster\xe2\x80\x94not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to continue running\nits ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cspecific and repeated cross-reference\xe2\x80\x9d to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website\xe2\x80\x99s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed \xe2\x80\x9cWedding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLoan,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting\xe2\x80\x9d and wished to contact their Senators\xe2\x80\x94as the ads requested\xe2\x80\x94would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators\xe2\x80\x99 positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for \xe2\x80\x9ce-alerts,\xe2\x80\x9d some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context\xe2\x80\x94such as whether an ad \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 207\xe2\x80\x94but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises First Amendment concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/index.html">310 U.

This Court has never recognized a compelling interest in regulating ads, like WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s, that are neither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent.  The District Court below considered interests that might justify regulating WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads here, and found none sufficiently compelling.  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 208\xe2\x80\x93210.  We reach the same conclusion.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the First Amendment as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776\xe2\x80\x93777.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has long recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9clarge independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest\xe2\x80\x94which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94to ads that were the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204\xe2\x80\x93206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants argue that an expansive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on First Amendment freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654\xe2\x80\x93655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating \xe2\x80\x9ca different type of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675\xe2\x80\x93678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9creflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other\xe2\x80\x9d).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to \xe2\x80\x9cassume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cbait and switch\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94a contention we have already rejected.  We hold that the interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> as justifying regulation of corporate campaign speech and extended in <em>McConnell</em> to the functional equivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of the sort engaged in by WRTL.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s speech, we hold that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional as applied to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWedding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLoan,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting\xe2\x80\x9d ads.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases are about political speech.  The importance of the cases to speech and debate on public policy issues is reflected in the number of diverse organizations that have joined in supporting WRTL before this Court: the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, Focus on the Family, the Coalition of Public Charities, the Cato Institute, and many others.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet, as is often the case in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment opinions, we have gotten this far in the analysis without quoting the Amendment itself: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Framers\xe2\x80\x99 actual words put these cases in proper perspective.  Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure political speech\xe2\x80\x94between what is protected and what the Government may ban\xe2\x80\x94it is worth recalling the language we are applying.  <em>McConnell</em> held that express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban\xe2\x80\x94the issue we <em>do</em> have to decide\xe2\x80\x94we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  The First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s command that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d demands at least that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (A) provides:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i)\xe2\x80\x82The term \xe2\x80\x98electioneering communication\xe2\x80\x99 means any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(I)\xe2\x80\x82refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(II)\xe2\x80\x82is made within\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(aa)\xe2\x80\x8260 days before a general, special, or runoff election for the office sought by the candidate; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(bb)\xe2\x80\x8230 days before a primary or preference election, or a convention or caucus of a political party that has authority to nominate a candidate, for the office sought by the candidate; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(III)\xe2\x80\x82in the case of a communication which refers to a candidate for an office other than President or Vice President, is targeted to the relevant electorate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U.

See <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of <em>no reasonable interpretation</em> other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual\xe2\x80\x9d factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA \xc2\xa7203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s proposed three-prong test as \xe2\x80\x9cclear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 17.

To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly \xe2\x80\x9cadvocating the election or defeat of a candidate\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94using the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy.  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  <em>Id.</em>, at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, <em>Buckley</em> would surely have adopted it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in <em>Buckley</em> was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.

And despite Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the contrary, our citation of <em>Buckley </em>along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statutory construction as a constitutional test.  </p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Nothing in <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering purpose\xe2\x80\x9d forecloses this conclusion.  540 U.

The <em>McConnell</em> Court did not find that a \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  For the reasons we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  In addition, the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d statement was not necessary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s facial holding in <em>McConnell</em>.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications be legitimate.  \xe2\x80\x9c[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot be considered binding authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kastigar</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/index.html">406 U.

First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the \xe2\x80\x9cPAC alternative\xe2\x80\x9d gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See <em>post, </em>at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See <em>MCFL</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html">479 U. S. 238</a>, 253\xe2\x80\x93255 (1986) (plurality opinion).  <em>McConnell</em> did conclude that segregated funds \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents\xe2\x80\x94and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S., at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see <em>post, </em>at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 569\xe2\x80\x93573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, <em>post, </em>at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says \xe2\x80\x9cI disagree with the draft,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U.

I never said we had to change the king\xe2\x80\x94no, no, no, no!  But I said that some things the king is doing, I do not like.  Is that a crime?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Well, in the United States (making due allowance for the fact that we have elected representatives instead of a king) it <em>is</em> a crime, at least if the speaker is a union or a corporation (including not-for-profit public-interest corporations) and if the representative is identified by name within a certain period before a primary or congressional election in which he is running.  That is the import of \xc2\xa7203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), the constitutionality of which we upheld three Terms ago in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003).  As an element essential to that determination of constitutionality, our opinion left open the possibility that a corporation or union could establish that, in the particular circumstances of its case, the ban was unconstitutional because it was (to pursue the analogy) <em>only</em> the king\xe2\x80\x99s policies and not his tenure in office that was criticized.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s cases present the question of what sort of showing is necessary for that purpose.  For the reasons I set forth below, it is my view that no test for such a showing can both (1) comport with the requirement of clarity that unchilled freedom of political speech demands, and (2) be compatible with the facial validity of \xc2\xa7203 (as pronounced in <em>McConnell</em>).  I would therefore reconsider the decision that sets us the unsavory task of separating issue-speech from election-speech with no clear criterion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s cases originated in the efforts of Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), a Wisconsin nonprofit, nonstock ideological advocacy corporation, to lobby Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees.  The problem for WRTL was that, under \xc2\xa7203 of BCRA, it would have been unlawful to air its television and radio ads within 30 days before the September 14, 2004, primary or within 60 days before the November 2, 2004, general election because the ads named Senator Feingold, who was then seeking reelection.  Section 203(a) of BCRA amended \xc2\xa7316(b)(2) of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which prohibited corporations and unions from \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election to any political office, or in connection with any primary election \xe2\x80\xa6 for any political office.\xe2\x80\x9d 2 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7441b(a).  Prior to BCRA, that section covered only expenditures for communications that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a candidate (in campaign-finance speak, so-called \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 204.  As amended, however, that section was broadened to cover \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which include \xe2\x80\x9cany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\xe2\x80\x9d and that is aired within 60 days before a general election, or 30 days before a primary election, in the jurisdiction in which the candidate is running.  \xc2\xa7434(f)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Under the new law, a corporation or union wishing to air advertisements covered by the definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d is prohibited by \xc2\xa7203 from doing so unless it first creates a separate segregated fund run by a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical action committee,\xe2\x80\x9d commonly known as a \xe2\x80\x9cPAC.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2)(C) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Three Terms ago, in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, this Court upheld most of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions against constitutional challenge, including \xc2\xa7203.  The Court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of ads aired during the 30-day and 60-day periods before elections were \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of express advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 206, but suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cpure issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 207, or \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 206, would be protected.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in these cases is whether \xc2\xa7203 can be applied to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads consistently with the First Amendment.  Last Term, this Court unanimously held, in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/410/index.html"></a><a href="/us/546/410/index.html">546 U.

The District Court in these cases subsequently held that \xc2\xa7203 is unconstitutional as applied to the three ads at issue.  The Court today affirms the judgment of the District Court.  While I agree with that result, I disagree with the principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A proper explanation of my views in these cases requires some discussion of the case law leading up to <em>McConnell</em>.  I begin with the seminal case of <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>, wherein this Court considered the constitutionality of various political contribution and expenditure limitations contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as amended, 88 Stat. 1263.  <em>Buckley</em> set forth a now-familiar framework for evaluating the constitutionality of campaign-finance regulations.  The Court began with the recognition that contributing money to, and spending money on behalf of, political candidates implicates core First Amendment protections, and that restrictions on such contributions and expenditures \xe2\x80\x9coperate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 14.  The Court also recognized, however, that the Government has a compelling interest in \xe2\x80\x9cprevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Court repeatedly referred was of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>quid pro quo</em>\xe2\x80\x9d variety, whereby an individual or entity makes a contribution or expenditure in exchange for some action by an official.  <em>Id.</em>, at 26, 27, 45, 47.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court then held that FECA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>contribution</em> limitations passed constitutional muster because they represented a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal restriction upon the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in free communication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, and were thus subject to a lower level of scrutiny, <em>id.</em>, at 25.  The Court invalidated, however, FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on independent expenditures (<em>i.e.</em>, expenditures made to express one\xe2\x80\x99s own positions and not in coordination with a campaign).  <em>Id.</em>, at 39\xe2\x80\x9351.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, expenditure limitations restrict speech that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 39, and require the highest scrutiny, <em>id.</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The independent-expenditure restriction at issue in <em>Buckley </em>limited the amount of money that could be spent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relative to a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 41 (quoting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) (repealed 1976)).  Before striking down the expenditure limitation, the Court narrowly construed \xc2\xa7608(e)(1), in light of vagueness concerns, to cover only express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94that is, advertising that \xe2\x80\x9cin express terms advocate[s] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office\xe2\x80\x9d by use of such words of advocacy \xe2\x80\x9cas \xe2\x80\x98vote for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98elect,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98support,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98cast your ballot for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Smith for Congress,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98vote against,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98defeat,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98reject.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 44, and n. 52.  This narrowing construction excluded so-called \xe2\x80\x9cissue advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, an ad that refers to a clearly identified candidate\xe2\x80\x99s position on an issue, but does not expressly advocate his election or defeat.  Even as narrowly construed to cover only express advocacy, however, \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) was held to be unconstitutional because the narrowed prohibition was too narrow to be effective and (quite apart from that shortcoming) independent expenditures did not pose a serious enough threat of corruption.  <em>Id.</em>, at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Notably, the Court also found the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\xe2\x80\x9d insufficient to support limitations on independent expenditures.  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley</em> might well have been the last word on limitations on independent expenditures.  Some argued, however, that independent expenditures <em>by corporations</em> should be treated differently.  That argument should have been foreclosed by <em>Buckley</em> for several reasons: (1) the particular provision at issue in <em>Buckley</em>, \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) of FECA, was directed to expenditures not just by \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals,\xe2\x80\x9d but by \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98persons\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d specifically defined to include \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98corporation[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 23, 39, n.\xc2\xa045; (2) the plaintiffs in <em>Buckley</em> included corporations, <em>id.</em>, at 8; and (3) <em>Buckley</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351, cited a case that involved limitations on corporations in support of its striking down the restriction at issue, <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/index.html">418 U. S. 241</a> (1974).  Moreover, pre-<em>Buckley</em> cases had accorded corporations full First Amendment protection.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U.

In that case, the Court struck down a Massachusetts statute that prohibited corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum unless the referendum materially affected the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s property, business, or assets.  As the Court explained: The principle that such advocacy is \xe2\x80\x9cat the heart of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cno less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U.

And the Court rejected the arguments that corporate participation \xe2\x80\x9cwould exert an undue influence on the outcome of a referendum vote\xe2\x80\x9d; that corporations would \xe2\x80\x9cdrown out other points of view\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the confidence of the people in the democratic process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 789; and that the prohibition was needed to protect corporate shareholders \xe2\x80\x9cby preventing the use of corporate resources in furtherance of views with which some shareholders may disagree,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 792\xe2\x80\x93793.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in one post-<em>Buckley</em> case: <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a> (1990).  This was the only pre-<em>McConnell</em> case in which this Court had ever permitted the Government to restrict political speech based on the corporate identity of the speaker.  <em>Austin</em> upheld state restrictions on corporate independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, any candidate in elections for state office.  494 U. S., at 654\xe2\x80\x93655.  The statute had been modeled after the federal statute that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 amended, which had been construed to reach only express advocacy, <em>id.</em>, at 655, n.\xc2\xa01.  And the ad at issue in <em>Austin</em> used the magical and forbidden words of express advocacy: \xe2\x80\x9cElect Richard Bandstra.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 714 (App. to opinion of Kennedy, J., dissenting).  How did the Court manage to reach this result without overruling <em>Bellotti?</em>  It purported to recognize a different class of corruption: \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 660.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the many problems with this \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d theory of corruption was that it actually constituted \xe2\x80\x9cthe same \xe2\x80\x98corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,\xe2\x80\x99 found insufficient to sustain a similar prohibition just a decade earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Bellotti</em>.  <em>McConnell, </em>540 U. S., at 325 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (quoting <em>Austin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 660; citation omitted).  Indeed, <em>Buckley</em> itself had cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against governmental abridgment of free expression cannot properly be made to depend on a person\xe2\x80\x99s financial ability to engage in public discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 49.  However, two Members of <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s 6-to-3 majority appear to have thought it significant that <em>Austin</em> involved express advocacy whereas <em>Bellotti</em> involved issue advocacy.  494 U. S., at 675\xe2\x80\x93676 (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>id.</em>, at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Austin</em> was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles.  In my view, it was wrongly decided.  The flawed rationale upon which it is based is examined at length elsewhere, including in a dissenting opinion in <em>Austin</em> that a Member of the 5-to-4 <em>McConnell</em> majority had joined, see <em>Austin,</em> 494 U. S., at 695\xe2\x80\x93713 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  See also <em>id., </em>at 679\xe2\x80\x93695 (Scalia, J., dissenting); <em>McConnell,</em> 540 U. S., at 257\xe2\x80\x93259 (opinion of Scalia, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 325\xe2\x80\x93330 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 273\xe2\x80\x93275 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  But at least <em>Austin</em> was limited to express advocacy, and <em>nonexpress</em> advocacy was presumed to remain protected under <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti, </em>even when engaged in by corporations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three Terms ago the Court extended <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s flawed rationale to cover an even broader class of speech.  In <em>McConnell</em>, the Court rejected a facial overbreadth challenge to BCRA \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on corporate and union advertising, which were not limited to express advocacy but covered vast amounts of nonexpress advocacy (embraced within the term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d).  540 U. S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93209.  The Court held that, at least in light of the availability of the PAC option, the compelling governmental interest that supported restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacy also justified the extension of those restrictions to \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of which were intended to influence elections.  <em>Id.</em>, at 206.  Of course, the compelling interest to which the Court referred was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 660).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe justifications for the regulation of express advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9capply equally\xe2\x80\x9d to ads run during the BCRA blackout period \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent \xe2\x80\xa6 [those ads] are <em>the functional equivalent of express advocacy</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 206 (emphasis added).  The Court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of ads aired during the 30- and 60-day periods before elections fit that description.  Finally, the Court concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven \xe2\x80\xa6 assum[ing] that BCRA will inhibit some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cpure issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 207, or \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 206, and n. 88), its application to such ads was insubstantial, and thus the statute was not overbroad, <em>id.</em>, at 207.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not foreclose as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203, <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412, which brings me back to the present cases.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question is whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge to BCRA \xc2\xa7203.  Answering that question obviously requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious one, and the one suggested by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and intervenors, is the standard set forth in <em>McConnell</em> itself: whether the advertisement is the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent of express advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell, supra</em>, at 206.  See also Brief for Appellant FEC 18 (arguing that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadvertisements are the functional equivalent of the sort of express advocacy that this Court has long recognized may be constitutionally regulated\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93970, p.\xc2\xa014 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts should apply the standard articulated in <em>McConnell;</em> Congress may constitutionally restrict corporate funding of ads that are the \xe2\x80\x98functional equivalent of express advocacy\xe2\x80\x99 for or against a candidate\xe2\x80\x9d).  Intervenors flesh out the standard somewhat further: \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts should ask whether the ad\xe2\x80\x99s audience would reasonably understand the ad, in the context of the campaign, to promote or attack the candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The District Court instead articulated a five-factor test that looks to whether the ad under review \xe2\x80\x9c(1) describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future; (2) refers to the prior voting record or current position of the named candidate on the issue described; (3) exhorts the listener to do anything other than contact the candidate about the described issue; (4) promotes, attacks, supports, or opposes the named candidate; and (5) refers to the upcoming election, candidacy, and/or political party of the candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  The backup definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d contained in BCRA itself, see n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra,</em> offers another possibility.  It covers any communication that \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes or supports a candidate for that office \xe2\x80\xa6 (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the principal opinion in this case offers a variation of its own (one bearing a strong likeness to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s backup definition): whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a fundamental and inescapable problem with all of these various tests.  Each of them (and every other test that is tied to the public perception, or a court\xe2\x80\x99s perception, of the import, the intent, or the effect of the ad) is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental First Amendment rights of the large segment of society to which \xc2\xa7203 applies.  Consider the application of these tests to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads: There is not the slightest doubt that these ads had an issue-advocacy component.  They explicitly urged lobbying on the pending legislative issue of appellate-judge filibusters.  The question before us is whether something about them caused them to be the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy, and thus constitutionally subject to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s criminal penalty.  Does any of the tests suggested above answer this question with the degree of clarity necessary to avoid the chilling of fundamental political discourse?  I think not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d test does nothing more than restate the question (and make clear that the electoral advocacy need not be express).  The test which asks how the ad\xe2\x80\x99s audience \xe2\x80\x9cwould reasonably understand the ad\xe2\x80\x9d provides ample room for debate and uncertainty.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s five-factor test does not (and could not possibly) specify how much weight is to be given to each factor\xe2\x80\x94and includes the inherently vague factor of whether the ad \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes, attacks, supports, or opposes the named candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Does attacking the king\xe2\x80\x99s position attack the king?)  The tests which look to whether the ad is \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no plausible meaning\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate seem tighter.  They ultimately depend, however, upon a judicial judgment (or is it\xe2\x80\x94worse still\xe2\x80\x94a jury judgment?) concerning \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d import that is far from certain, that rests upon consideration of innumerable surrounding circumstances which the speaker may not even be aware of, and that lends itself to distortion by reason of the decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s subjective evaluation of the importance or unimportance of the challenged speech.  In this critical area of political discourse, the speaker cannot be compelled to risk felony prosecution with no more assurance of impunity than his prediction that what he says will be found susceptible of some \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under these circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speech\xe2\x80\x94harming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/113/index.html">539 U. S. 113</a>, 119 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It will not do to say that this burden must be accepted\xe2\x80\x94that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s antifilibustering, constitutionally protected speech can be constrained\xe2\x80\x94in the necessary pursuit of electoral \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have rejected the \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t-make-an-omelet-without-breaking-eggs\xe2\x80\x9d approach to the First Amendment, even for the infinitely less important (and less protected) speech category of virtual child pornography.  In <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U. S. 234</a> (2002), the Government argued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of producing images by using computer imaging makes it very difficult for it to prosecute those who produce pornography by using real children.  Experts \xe2\x80\xa6 may have difficulty in saying whether the pictures were made by using real children or by using computer imaging.  The necessary solution \xe2\x80\xa6 is to prohibit both kinds of images.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 254\xe2\x80\x93255.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court rejected the principle that protected speech may be banned because it is difficult to distinguish from unprotected speech.  <em>Ibid</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cturns the First Amendment upside down.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 255.  The same principle must be applied here.  Indeed, it must be applied <em>a fortiori, </em>since laws targeting political speech are the principal object of the First-Amendment guarantee.  The fact that the line between electoral advocacy and issue advocacy dissolves in practice is an indictment of the statute, not a justification of it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley</em> itself compels the conclusion that these tests fall short of the clarity that the First Amendment demands.  Recall that <em>Buckley</em> narrowed the ambiguous phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany expenditure \xe2\x80\xa6 relative to a clearly identified candidate\xe2\x80\x9d to mean any expenditure \xe2\x80\x9cadvocating the election or defeat of a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that construction alone did not eliminate the vagueness problem because \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Any effort to distinguish between the two based on intent of the speaker or effect of the speech on the listener would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pu[t] the speaker \xe2\x80\xa6 wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98offe[r] no security for free discussion,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98compe[l] the speaker to hedge and trim.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/516/index.html">323 U. S. 516</a>, 535 (1945)).  In order to avoid these \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional deficiencies,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court was compelled to narrow the statutory language even further to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, <em>Buckley</em> would surely have adopted it.  Especially since a consequence of the express-advocacy interpretation<font b="1"> was the invalidation of<font b="1"> the entire limitation on independent expenditures, in part because the statute (as thus narrowed) could not be an effective limitation on expenditures for electoral advocacy.  (It would be \xe2\x80\x9cnaiv[e],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley </em>said, to pretend that persons and groups would have difficulty \xe2\x80\x9cdevising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.)  Why did <em>Buckley </em>employ such a \xe2\x80\x9chighly strained\xe2\x80\x9d reading of the statute, <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 280 (opinion of Thomas, J.), when broader readings, more faithful to the text, were available that might not have resulted in such underinclusiveness?  In particular, after going to the trouble of narrowing the statute to cover \xe2\x80\x9cadvocacy of [the] election or defeat of a candidat[e],\xe2\x80\x9d why not do what the principal opinion in these cases does, which is essentially to preface that phrase with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  There is only one plausible explanation: The Court eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to the text and more effective at capturing campaign speech <em>because those tests were all too vague</em>.  We cannot now adopt a standard held to be facially vague on the theory that it is somehow clear enough for constitutional as-applied challenges.  If <em>Buckley</em> foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the principal opinion purports to recognize the \xe2\x80\x9cimperative for clarity\xe2\x80\x9d in this area of First Amendment law, its attempt to distinguish its test from the test found to be vague in <em>Buckley </em>falls far short.  It claims to be \xe2\x80\x9cnot so sure\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Buckley</em> rejected its test because <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding did not concern \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the constitutional standard was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa07.  Forget about abstractions: The<em> </em>specific statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> was interpreted to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98advocating the election or defeat of a candidate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that is materially identical to the operative language in the principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s test.  The principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s protestation that <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness holding \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not dictate a constitutional test,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa07, is utterly compromised by the fact that the principal opinion itself relies on the very same vagueness holding to reject an intent-and-effect test in this case.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (citing <em>Buckley, supra</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344).  It is the <em>same</em> vagueness holding, and the principal opinion cannot invoke it on page 13 of its opinion and disclaim it on page 22.  Finally, the principal opinion quotes <em>McConnell</em> for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>Buckley</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa07 (quoting <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 190).  I am not sure why this cryptic statement is at all relevant, since we are discussing here the principle of constitutional law that <em>underlay Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express-advocacy restriction.  In any case, the statement is assuredly not a repudiation of<em> Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness holding, since overbreadth and not vagueness was the issue in <em>McConnell.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What, then, is to be done?  We could adopt WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test, under which \xc2\xa7203 may not be applied to any ad (1) that \xe2\x80\x9cfocuses on a current legislative branch matter, takes a position on the matter, and urges the public to ask a legislator to take a particular position or action with respect to the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mention any election, candidacy, political party, or challenger, or the official\xe2\x80\x99s character, qualifications, or fitness for office,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) whether or not it \xe2\x80\x9csay[s] that the public official is wrong or right on the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as it does not expressly say he is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong for [the] office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellee 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (footnote omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Or we could of course adopt the <em>Buckley </em>test of express advocacy.  The problem is that, although these tests are clear, they are incompatible with <em>McConnell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding that \xc2\xa7203 is facially constitutional, which was premised on the finding that a vast majority of ads proscribed by \xc2\xa7203 are \xe2\x80\x9csham issue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 185, that fall outside the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  Indeed, <em>any</em> clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by \xc2\xa7203 that \xc2\xa7203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  The Government claims that even the amorphous test adopted by the District Court \xe2\x80\x9ccall[s] into question a substantial percentage of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applications,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 4,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and that <em>any</em> test providing relief to WRTL is incompatible with <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s facial holding because WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads are in the \xe2\x80\x9cheartland\xe2\x80\x9d of what Congress meant to prohibit, Brief for Appellant FEC 18, 28, 36, n.\xc2\xa09.  If that is so, then <em>McConnell</em> cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the <em>Buckley</em> Court and the parties to these cases, I recognize the practical reality that corporations can evade the express-advocacy standard.  I share the instinct that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat separates issue advocacy and political advocacy is a line in the sand drawn on a windy day.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>McConnell, supra</em>, at 126, n.\xc2\xa016 (internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for Appellant FEC 30; Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93970, p.\xc2\xa035.  But the way to indulge that instinct consistently with the First Amendment is either to eliminate restrictions on independent expenditures altogether or to <em>confine</em> them to one side of the <em>traditional</em> line\xe2\x80\x94the express-advocacy line, set in concrete on a calm day by <em>Buckley</em>, several decades ago.  Section 203\xe2\x80\x99s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing analysis shows that <em>McConnell </em>was mistaken in its belief that as-applied challenges could eliminate the unconstitutional applications of \xc2\xa7203.  They can do so only if a test is adopted which contradicts the holding of <em>McConnell\xe2\x80\x94</em>that \xc2\xa7203 is facially valid because the vast majority of pre-election issue ads can constitutionally be proscribed.  In light of the weakness in <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, and in light of the longstanding acceptance of the clarity of <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express-advocacy line, it was adventurous for <em>McConnell</em> to extend <em>Austin</em> beyond corporate speech constituting express advocacy.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s cases make it apparent that the adventure is a flop, and that <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding concerning \xc2\xa7203 was wrong.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Which brings me to the question of <em>stare decisis</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Stare decisis</em> is not an inexorable command\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/808/index.html">501 U.

Just three years after our erroneous decision in <em>Minersville School Dist.</em> v. <em>Gobitis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/586/index.html">310 U. S. 586</a> (1940), the Court corrected the error in <em>Barnette</em>.  Overruling a constitutional case decided just a few years earlier is far from unprecedented.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of particular relevance to the <em>stare decisis</em> question in these cases is the impracticability of the regime created by <em>McConnell</em>.  <em>Stare decisis</em> considerations carry little weight when an erroneous \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning decisio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d has created an \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable\xe2\x80\x9d legal regime.  <em>Payne, supra</em>, at 827.  As described above, the <em>McConnell </em>regime is unworkable because of the inability of any acceptable as-applied test to validate the facial constitutionality of \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x94that is, its inability to sustain proscription of the vast majority of issue ads.  We could render the regime workable only by effectively overruling <em>McConnell</em> without saying so\xe2\x80\x94adopting a clear as-applied rule protective of speech in the \xe2\x80\x9cheartland\xe2\x80\x9d of what Congress prohibited.  The promise of an administrable as-applied rule that is both effective in the vindication of First Amendment rights and consistent with <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding is illusory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not as though <em>McConnell</em> produced a settled body of law.  Indeed, it is far more accurate to say that <em>McConnell</em> <em>unsettled</em> a body of law.  Not until 1947, with the enactment of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, did Congress even purport to regulate campaign-related expenditures of corporations and unions.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>CIO</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/106/index.html">335 U. S. 106</a>, 107, 113\xe2\x80\x93115 (1948).  In the three decades following, this Court expressly declined to pronounce upon the constitutionality of such restrictions on independent expenditures.  See <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/385/index.html">407 U. S. 385</a>, 400 (1972); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/567/index.html">352 U. S. 567</a>, 591\xe2\x80\x93592 (1957); <em>CIO, supra</em>, at 110, 124.  When the Court finally did turn to that question, it struck them down.  See <em>Buckley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U.

The modest medicine of restoring First Amendment protection to nonexpress advocacy\xe2\x80\x94speech that was protected until three Terms ago\xe2\x80\x94does not unsettle an established body of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither do any of the other considerations relevant to <em>stare decisis</em> suggest adherence to <em>McConnell</em>.  These cases do not involve property or contract rights, where reliance interests are involved.  <em>Payne, supra</em>, at 828.  And  <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7203 holding has assuredly not become \xe2\x80\x9cembedded\xe2\x80\x9d in our \xe2\x80\x9cnational culture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U.

If \xc2\xa7203 has had any cultural impact, it has been to undermine the traditional and important role of grassroots advocacy in American politics by burdening the \xe2\x80\x9cbudget-strapped nonprofit entities upon which many of our citizens rely for political commentary and advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.

He said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]hat we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[y]ou can\xe2\x80\x99t have both.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Gibbs, The Wake-Up Call, Time, Feb. 3, 1997, pp. 22, 25.  (He was referring, presumably, to incumbents\xe2\x80\x99 notions of healthy campaigns.)  If he was wrong, however, and the two values can coexist, it is pretty clear which side of the equation <em>this institution </em>is primarily responsible for.  It is perhaps our most important constitutional task to assure freedom of political speech.  And when a statute creates a regime as unworkable and unconstitutional as today\xe2\x80\x99s effort at as-applied review proves \xc2\xa7203 to be, it is our responsibility to decline enforcement.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is wondrous irony to be found in both the genesis and the consequences of BCRA.

In the fact that the effect of BCRA has been to concentrate more political power in the hands of the country\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest individuals and their so-called 527 organizations, unregulated by \xc2\xa7203.

The wait-and-see approach makes no sense and finds no support in our cases.  How will we know that would-be speakers have been chilled and have not spoken?  If a tree <em>does not</em> fall in the forest, can we hear the sound it would have made had it fallen?  Our normal practice is to assess <em>ex ante</em> the risk that a standard will have an impermissible chilling effect on First Amendment protected speech.  Justice Alito seemed to recognize that as recently as, well, today.  In another opinion released this morning, he finds that a proposed test for censoring student speech \xe2\x80\x9ccan easily be manipulated in dangerous ways,\xe2\x80\x9d wherefore he \xe2\x80\x9cwould reject it <em>before such abuse occurs</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morse</em> v. <em>Frederick</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 2 (concurring opinion) (emphasis added).

See <em>ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa07.  I disagree.  WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s test requires yes or no answers to a series of precise and focused questions: Does the ad take a position on a legislative matter?  Does it mention the election?  Does it expressly say the candidate is wrong for the office?  A group of children\xe2\x80\x94indeed, even a group of college students\xe2\x80\x94could answer these questions with great consistency.  The principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s test, by contrast, hinges on assessment of the reasonableness of a determination that something does not constitute advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The same must be said, I think, of the test proposed by the principal opinion.  While its coverage is not entirely clear, it would apparently protect even <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>paradigmatic example of the functional equivalent of express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cJane Doe ad,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9ccondemned Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \xe2\x80\x98call Jane Doe and tell her what you think,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 126\xe2\x80\x93127.  Indeed, it at least arguably protects the most \xe2\x80\x9cstriking\xe2\x80\x9d example of a so-called sham issue ad in the <em>McConnell</em> record, the notorious \xe2\x80\x9cYellowtail ad,\xe2\x80\x9d which accused Bill Yellowtail of striking his wife and then urged listeners to call him and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ell him to support family values.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 193\xe2\x80\x93194, n. 78 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The claim that \xc2\xa7203 on its face does not reach a substantial amount of speech protected under the principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94and that the test is therefore compatible with <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x94seems to me indefensible.  Indeed, the principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at distinguishing <em>McConnell</em> is unpersuasive enough, and the change in the law it works is substantial enough, that seven Justices of this Court, having widely divergent views concerning the constitutionality of the restrictions at issue, agree that the opinion effectively overrules <em>McConnell</em> without saying so.  See <em>post</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (Souter, J., dissenting).  This faux judicial restraint is judicial obfuscation.  </p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>McConnell</em> explained why the possibility of corporations\xe2\x80\x99 funding speech out of a PAC does not save the statute from constitutional infirmity.  See 540 U. S., at 330\xe2\x80\x93333.  <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of those arguments rested, of course, upon the assumption that for non-PAC genuine issue ads as-applied challenges would be available.

The purpose of the ad was to put political pressure upon Senator Feingold to change his position on the filibuster\xe2\x80\x94not only through the constituents who accepted the invitation to contact him, but also through the very existence of an ad bringing to the public\xe2\x80\x99s attention that he, Senator Feingold, stood athwart the allowance of a vote on judicial nominees.

In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And in the 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history\xe2\x80\x9d).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (\xe2\x80\x9cFor all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more\xe2\x80\x9d).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined \xe2\x80\x9cClinton Leads the Money Race\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven \xe2\x80\x9cby stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Committee for Economic Development et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02\xe2\x80\x931674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 130\xe2\x80\x93131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[b]usiness leaders believe\xe2\x80\x94based on experience and with good reason\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\xa6 access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member\xe2\x80\x99s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue\xe2\x80\x9d).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose \xe2\x80\x9cunique legal and economic characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d are tailored to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U.

Not unnaturally, corporations filled the vacuum, see R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts xvi\xe2\x80\x93xvii (1988) (hereinafter Mutch), and in due course demonstrated what concentrated capital could do.

In his next message to Congress, President Theodore Roosevelt invoked the power \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the integrity of the elections of its own officials [as] inherent\xe2\x80\x9d in government, and called for \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous measures to eradicate\xe2\x80\x9d perceived political corruption, for he found \xe2\x80\x9cno enemy of free government more dangerous and none so insidious.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  39 Cong.

And in due course reaction began to build: \xe2\x80\x9c[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action \xe2\x80\xa6 , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, \xc2\xa79, 57 Stat. 167\xe2\x80\x93168, an extension that was made permanent in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as Taft-Hartley, \xc2\xa7304, 61 Stat. 159\xe2\x80\x93160.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution[s]\xe2\x80\x9d was being so narrowly construed as to open a \xe2\x80\x9cloophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an \xe2\x80\x98expenditure\xe2\x80\x99 rather than a contribution.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term \xe2\x80\x98making any contribution\xe2\x80\x99 related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?\xe2\x80\x9d).  Taft-Hartley therefore extended the prohibition to any \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution or expenditure\xe2\x80\x9d by a corporation or a union \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d a federal election.  \xc2\xa7304, 61 Stat. 159.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/385/index.html">407 U. S. 385</a>, 409 (1972), that Taft-Hartley did not prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cunion contributions and expenditures from political funds\nfinanced in some sense by the voluntary donations of employees.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This balance of authorized and restricted financing methods for corporate and union electioneering was made explicit in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA).  See 86 Stat. 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he phrase \xe2\x80\x98contribution or expenditure\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 shall not include \xe2\x80\xa6 the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund to be utilized for political purposes by a corporation or labor organization\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he underlying theory [of the statute was] that substantial general purpose treasuries should not be diverted to political purposes, both because of the effect on the political process of such aggregated wealth and out of concern for the dissenting member or stockholder.\xe2\x80\x9d  117 Cong.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We held that to avoid vagueness, the product of prohibited corporate and union expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cmust constitute \xe2\x80\x98express advocacy\xe2\x80\x99 in order to be subject to the prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 249.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus held that the prohibition applied \xe2\x80\x9conly to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]xpress terms,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, meant what had already become known as \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vote for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98elect,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98support,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98cast your ballot for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Smith for Congress,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98vote against,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98defeat,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98reject.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em> </em>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in <em>Buckley:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness \xe2\x80\xa6 undermines the limitation\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.</em>, at 45.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.

We held that this \xe2\x80\x9clegitima[te]\xe2\x80\x9d concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither \xe2\x80\x9cengage[d] in business activities\xe2\x80\x9d nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a \xe2\x80\x9ccondui[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263\xe2\x80\x93264.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">F</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>As was expectable, narrowing the corporate-union electioneering limitation to magic words soon reduced it to futility<em>.  </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[P]olitical money \xe2\x80\xa6 is a moving target,\xe2\x80\x9d Issacharoff &amp; Karlan, The Hydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform, 77 Tex.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television \xe2\x80\x9cissue ad\xe2\x80\x9d that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Bill Yellowtail?

S., at 194, and we held that the resulting line separating regulated election speech from general political discourse does not, on its face, violate the First Amendment.  We rejected any suggestion \xe2\x80\x9cthat <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cour decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 192\xe2\x80\x93193.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,\xe2\x80\x9d which is prohibitable, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a true issue ad,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, since ads that \xe2\x80\x9cesche[w] the use of magic words \xe2\x80\xa6 are no less clearly intended to influence the election.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ittle difference \xe2\x80\xa6 between an ad that urged viewers to \xe2\x80\x98vote against Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99 and one that condemned Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \xe2\x80\x98call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 126\xe2\x80\x93127.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for \xc2\xa7203 exemplified a tradition of \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly sustained legislation aimed at \xe2\x80\x98the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660).  Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  \xe2\x80\x9cFar from establishing that BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the \xc2\xa7203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is \xe2\x80\x98simply wrong\xe2\x80\x99 to view [\xc2\xa7203] as a \xe2\x80\x98complete ban\xe2\x80\x99 on expression rather than a regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/146/index.html">539 U. S. 146</a>, 162 (2003)).  Thus \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [in the runup period] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated [PAC] fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  And a nonprofit may use its general treasury to pay for clearly \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d so long as it declines to serve as a conduit for money from business corporations and unions (and thus qualifies for the <em>MCFL</em> exception).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of \xe2\x80\x9cgrassroots\xe2\x80\x9d about them.  Neither Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The corporate appellee in these cases, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), is a nonprofit corporation funded to a significant extent by contributions from other corporations.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93121.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.

In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9343, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its \xe2\x80\x9cTop Election Priorities\xe2\x80\x9d were to \xe2\x80\x9cRe-elect George W.

In one of these, the Chair of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s PAC was quoted as saying, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 82\xe2\x80\x9383.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined \xe2\x80\x9cRadically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!\xe2\x80\x9d, which reported that \xe2\x80\x9cFeingold has been active in his opposition to Bush\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees\xe2\x80\x9d and said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 101\xe2\x80\x93103.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed \xe2\x80\x9cgroup of Senators\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cusing the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 vote,\xe2\x80\x9d and described the Senators\xe2\x80\x99 actions as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  They exhorted viewers and listeners to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the \xe2\x80\x9cgroup\xe2\x80\x9d condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster \xe2\x80\x9c16 out of 16 times\xe2\x80\x9d and accused them of \xe2\x80\x9cputting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and his Republican opponents, who vocally opposed the filibusters, made the issue a major talking point in their campaigns against him.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]o-called issue ads\xe2\x80\x9d being used \xe2\x80\x9cto advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to \xe2\x80\x98vote against Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99 and one that condemned Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \xe2\x80\x98call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 126\xe2\x80\x93127.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they \xe2\x80\x9ccondemned [Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s] record on a particular issue\xe2\x80\x9d and exhorted the public to contact him and \xe2\x80\x9ctell [him] what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s Feingold ads, then it follows that \xc2\xa7203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that \xc2\xa7203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a \xe2\x80\x9cstriking example\xe2\x80\x9d of one that was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly intended to influence the election,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d issue ad that might not be open to regulation under \xc2\xa7203, <em>id.</em>, at 206\xe2\x80\x93207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpure.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d then it must be a \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine\xe2\x80\x9d issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-\nsible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions and have that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 206.  But The Chief Justice says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our First Amendment enquiry on whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe speaker actually intended to affect an election.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The Chief Justice suggests it is more likely that the <em>McConnell</em> opinion inadvertently borrowed the language of \xe2\x80\x9cintended \xe2\x80\xa6 effect[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 206, from academic studies in the record of viewers\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of the ads\xe2\x80\x99 purposes, <em>ante</em>, at 12.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If The Chief Justice were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of \xc2\xa7203 contingent on whether a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmotives were pure,\xe2\x80\x9d or its issue advocacy \xe2\x80\x9csubjective[ly] sincer[e],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d which will be objectively apparent from those ads\xe2\x80\x99 content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that \xc2\xa7203 was not substantially overbroad because \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently could be regulated consistent with the First Amendment.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For that matter, if the studies to which The Chief Justice refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether \xc2\xa7203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the \xe2\x80\x9cactua[l] inten[tions],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable people are \xe2\x80\xa6 able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and The Chief Justice is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d person\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the ads\xe2\x80\x99 apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s own approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad\xe2\x80\x99s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s reelection?  The Chief Justice says that this information is \xe2\x80\x9cbeside the point,\xe2\x80\x9d because WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s history of overt electioneering only \xe2\x80\x9cgoes to [its] subjective intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being \xe2\x80\x9cone step removed from the text of the ads themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cfour corners\xe2\x80\x9d of the ads themselves.  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although The Chief Justice ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] and it is hard to imagine The Chief Justice would ever find an ad to be \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, unless it contained words of express advocacy.  The Chief Justice thus effectively reinstates the same toothless \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d criterion of regulable electioneering that led Congress to enact BCRA in the first place.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that \xc2\xa7203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  The Chief Justice argues that corporations must receive \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit of any doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em> </em>whenever we undertake the task of \xe2\x80\x9cseparating \xe2\x80\xa6 political speech protected under the First Amendment from that which may be banned,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13.  But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98simply wrong\xe2\x80\x99 to view [\xc2\xa7203] as a \xe2\x80\x98complete ban\xe2\x80\x99 on expression,\xe2\x80\x9d because PAC financing provides corporations \xe2\x80\x9cwith a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to \xc2\xa7203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC\xe2\x80\x99s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201\xe2\x80\x93202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that \xc2\xa7203 \xe2\x80\x9cbanned\xe2\x80\x9d WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s general treasury) if Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority apparently view WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s broadcasts either as \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issue ad[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of The Chief Justice), or as \xe2\x80\x9clobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s name would \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cContact your Senators\xe2\x80\x9d for the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cContact Senators Feingold and Kohl\xe2\x80\x9d would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the \xe2\x80\x9cSenators.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the suggestion that \xc2\xa7203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>\xe2\x80\x99s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and \xc2\xa7203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on \xc2\xa7203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held \xc2\xa7203 facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication,\xe2\x80\x9d which identifies the communications regulable under \xc2\xa7203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition \xe2\x80\x9cis held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d is to be defined as </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to The Chief Justice</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d: regulation is permissible only if the communication is \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of \xc2\xa7203 survives.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The price of <em>McConnell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>demise as authority on \xc2\xa7203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said \xe2\x80\x9ccall your Senators\xe2\x80\x9d instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding \xc2\xa7203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, 854\xe2\x80\x93855 (1992).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding has been \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable in practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/768/index.html">504 U. S. 768</a>, 783 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)<em>.</em> <em>McConnell </em>validated a clear rule resting on mostly bright-line conditions, and there is no indication that the statute has been difficult to apply.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nadequate\xe2\x80\x9d because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65\xe2\x80\x9366, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter\xe2\x80\x99s words, they demonstrate a threat to \xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of our electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads\xe2\x80\x9d without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today\xe2\x80\x99s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Substantially for the reasons stated by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310, I believe these cases are justiciable.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Between candidates, political action committees, interest groups, and national, state, and local parties, spending on the 2004 state and federal elections exceeded $4 billion.

We said:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U.

The \xe2\x80\x9creject[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s quotation of <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/516/index.html">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945), where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98laud unionism\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but forbade him to \xe2\x80\x9cimply an invitation\xe2\x80\x9d to join a union.  <em>Id.</em>, at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,\xe2\x80\x9d and no speaker \xe2\x80\x9csafely could assume that anything he might say \xe2\x80\xa6 would not be understood by some as an invitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in <em>Thomas </em>was left with an impermissibly limited universe of \xe2\x80\x9cthree choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 536.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how <em>McConnell</em> could use the language of intent and effect without \xe2\x80\x9ceven address[ing] what <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (and by extension, <em>Thomas</em>) \xe2\x80\x9chad to say on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  But one need not look far in our <em>McConnell</em> opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in <em>Thomas</em>.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: \xe2\x80\x9cin the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s name) or by altering the sources of their ads\xe2\x80\x99 financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in <em>McConnell</em>, and we did not overlook First Amendment jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA \xe2\x80\x9cshould provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise First Amendment rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, we already held in <em>McConnell</em> that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.</p>\n<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice speculates that <em>McConnell</em> derived its test for functional equivalence from \xe2\x80\x9c[t]wo key studies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12, but not a shred of language in <em>McConnell</em> supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, <em>McConnell</em> made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in <em>McConnell?</em>  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Other than WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s separate district court opinion in <em>McConnell</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the Brennan Center, the <em>Buying Time</em> reports were \xe2\x80\x98the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of\xe2\x80\x99 BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s electioneering communication provisions \xe2\x80\x98in support of their constitutional validity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308 (opinion of Henderson, J.)

For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been \xe2\x80\x9cno reason\xe2\x80\x9d to think that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.</p>\n<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a><p align="left">Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that \xc2\xa7203 is a \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d on speech.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 203\xe2\x80\x99s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in <em>McConnell</em> that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that \xc2\xa7203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]oday\xe2\x80\x99s cases make it apparent\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>McConnell</em> must be overruled, <em>ante</em>, at 18, there is nothing about today\xe2\x80\x99s cases that suggests that <em>McConnell</em> is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider <em>McConnell</em> from first principles.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
