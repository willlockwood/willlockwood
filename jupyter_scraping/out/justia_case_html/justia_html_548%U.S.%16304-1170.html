Marsh claimed on direct appeal that Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) establishes an unconstitutional presumption in favor of death by directing imposition of the death penalty when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise.

That provision authorizes review of a State\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment when a state statute\xe2\x80\x99s validity is questioned on federal constitutional grounds, and it permits review even when the state-court proceedings are not complete where the federal claim has been finally decided and later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, Cox Broadcasting Corp.</em> v. <em>Cohn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/index.html">420 U. S. 469</a>, 481.  Although Marsh will be retried, the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional is final and binding on the lower state courts.  Thus, the State will be unable to obtain further review of its law in this case.  This Court has deemed lower court decisions final for \xc2\xa71257 purposes in like circumstances, see, <em>e.g., </em> <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Meyers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/380/index.html">466 U.

Marsh maintains that the judgment was based on state law, the State Supreme Court having previously reviewed the statute in <em>State</em> v. <em>Kleypas.  </em>However, <em>Kleypas</em> itself rested on federal law.  In this case, the State Supreme Court chastised the <em>Kleypas</em> court for avoiding the constitutional issue, squarely found <em>\xc2\xa7</em>21\xe2\x80\x934624(e) unconstitutional on its face, and overruled <em>Kleypas</em> in relevant part.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 capital sentencing statute is constitutional.

S. 639</a>, requires approval of the Kansas statute.  There, the Court held that a state death penalty statute may give the defendant the burden to prove that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  <em>A fortiori,</em> Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 death penalty statute, consistent with the Constitution, may direct imposition of the death penalty when the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including where the two are in equipoise.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even if, as Marsh contends, <em>Walton</em> does not directly control here, general principles in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty jurisprudence lead to the same conclusion.  So long as a state system satisfies the requirements of <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a><em>,</em> and<em> Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>\xe2\x80\x94that a system must rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants and must permit a jury to render a reasonable, individualized sentencing determination\xe2\x80\x94a State has a range of discretion in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed.  The use of mitigation evidence is a product of the individual-sentencing requirement.  Defendants have the right to present sentencers with information relevant to the sentencing decision and sentencers are obliged to consider that information in determining the appropriate sentence.  The thrust of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation jurisprudence ends here, for the Court has never held that the Constitution requires a specific method for balancing aggravating and mitigating factors.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 death penalty statute satisfies the constitutional mandates of <em>Furman</em> and its progeny because it rationally narrows the class of death-eligible defendants and permits a jury to consider any mitigating evidence relevant to its sentencing determination.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s weighing equation merely channels a jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion by providing criteria by which the jury may determine whether life or death is appropriate.  Its system provides the kind of guided discretion sanctioned in, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Walton, supra</em>.  Contrary to Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s argument, \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) does not create a general presumption in favor of the death penalty.  A life sentence must be imposed if the State fails to demonstrate the existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, if the State cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, or if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision in any respect.  Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s contentions that an equipoise determination reflects juror confusion or inability to decide between life and death or that the jury may use equipoise as a loophole to shirk its constitutional duty to render a reasoned, moral sentencing decision rest on an implausible characterization of the Kansas statute\xe2\x80\x94that a jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that aggravators and mitigators are in equipoise is not a <em>decision,</em> much less a decision <em>for death</em>.  Weighing is not an end, but a means to reaching a decision.  Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 instructions clearly inform the jury that a determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a decision for death.

Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) (1995).  We must decide whether this statute, which requires the imposition of the death penalty when the sentencing jury determines that aggravating evidence and mitigating evidence are in equipoise, violates the Constitution.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Michael Lee Marsh II broke into the home of Marry Ane Pusch and lay in wait for her to return.  When Marry Ane entered her home with her 19-month-old daughter, M.\xc2\xa0P., Marsh repeatedly shot Marry Ane, stabbed her, and slashed her throat.  The home was set on fire with the toddler inside, and M.\xc2\xa0P. burned to death.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury convicted Marsh of the capital murder of M.\xc2\xa0P., the first-degree premeditated murder of Marry Ane, aggravated arson, and aggravated burglary.  The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of three aggravating circumstances, and that those circumstances were not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances.  On the basis of those findings, the jury sentenced Marsh to death for the capital murder of M.\xc2\xa0P.  The jury also sentenced Marsh to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 40 years for the first-degree murder of Marry Ane, and consecutive sentences of 51 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for aggravated arson and 34 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal, Marsh challenged \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e), which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in K.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. 21\xe2\x80\x934625 \xe2\x80\xa6 exist and, further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist, the defendant shall be sentenced to death; otherwise the defendant shall be sentenced as provided by law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nFocusing on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be sentenced to death,\xe2\x80\x9d Marsh argued that \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) establishes an unconstitutional presumption in favor of death because it directs imposition of the death penalty when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Kansas Supreme Court agreed, and held that the Kansas death penalty statute, \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e), is facially unconstitutional.  278 Kan. 520, 534\xe2\x80\x93535, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d 445, 458 (2004).  The court concluded that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s weighing equation violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution because, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the event of equipoise, <em>i.e.,</em> the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the balance of any aggravating circumstances and any mitigating circumstances weighed equal, the death penalty would be required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 534, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 457.  The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence for aggravated burglary and premeditated murder of Marry Ane, and reversed and remanded for new trial Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s convictions for capital murder of M.\xc2\xa0P. and aggravated arson.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/1060/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/1060/index.html">544 U.

Having considered the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, we conclude that we have jurisdiction in this case and that the constitutional issue is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 authorizes this Court to review, by writ of certiorari, the final judgment of the highest court of a State when the validity of a state statute is questioned on federal constitutional grounds.  This Court has determined that the foregoing authorization permits review of the judgment of the highest court of a State, even though the state-court proceedings are not yet complete, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cox Broadcasting, supra</em>, at 481.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, although Marsh will be retried on the capital murder and aggravated arson charges, the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 death penalty statute is facially unconstitutional is final and binding on the lower state courts.  Thus, the State will be unable to obtain further review of its death penalty law later in this case.  If Marsh is acquitted of capital murder, double jeopardy and state law will preclude the State from appealing.  If he is reconvicted, the State will be prohibited under the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision from seeking the death penalty, and there would be no opportunity for the State to seek further review of that prohibition.  Although Marsh argues that a provision of the Kansas criminal appeals statute, Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x933602(b) (2003 Cum. Supp.), would permit the State to appeal the invalidation of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 death penalty statute, that contention is meritless.  That statute provides for limited appeal in only four enumerated circumstances, none of which apply here.  We have deemed lower court decisions final for 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 purposes in like circumstances, see <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Meyers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/380/index.html">466 U. S. 380</a> (1984) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>South Dakota </em>v.<em> Neville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/553/index.html">459 U.

Marsh maintains that the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was based on the severability of \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) under state law, and not the constitutionality of that provision under federal law, the latter issue having been resolved by the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v.<em> Kleypas</em>, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P. 3d 139 (2001).  Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Kleypas</em>, itself, rested on federal law.  See <em>id.</em>, at 899\xe2\x80\x93903, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 166\xe2\x80\x93167.  In rendering its determination here, the Kansas Supreme Court observed that <em>Kleypas</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cheld that the weighing equation in K.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. 21\xe2\x80\x934624(e) as written was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to cases in which aggravating evidence and mitigating evidence are equally balanced.  278 Kan., at 534, 102 P. 3d, at 457.  In this case, the Kansas Supreme Court chastised the <em>Kleypas</em> court for avoiding the constitutional issue of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s facial validity, squarely held that \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) is unconstitutional on its face, and overruled the portion of <em>Kleypas </em>upholding the statute through the constitutional avoidance doctrine and judicial revision.  278 Kan., at 534\xe2\x80\x93535, 539\xe2\x80\x93542, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 458, 462.  As in <em>Kleypas</em>, the Kansas Supreme Court clearly rested its decision here on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  We, therefore, have jurisdiction to review its decision.  See <em>Michigan </em>v.<em> Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1040\xe2\x80\x931041 (1983).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is controlled by <em>Walton</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/639/index.html">497 U.

In that case, a jury had convicted Walton of a capital offense.  At sentencing, the trial judge found the existence of two aggravating circumstances and that the mitigating circumstances did not call for leniency, and sentenced Walton to death.  497 U. S., at 645.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the Arizona Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton</em>, 159 Ariz. 571, 769 P.\xc2\xa02d 1017 (1989) (en banc) (holding the Arizona death penalty statute constitutional), and the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Adamson</em> v. <em>Ricketts</em>, 865 F.\xc2\xa02d 1011, 1043\xe2\x80\x931044 (1988) (en banc) (finding the Arizona death penalty statute unconstitutional because, \xe2\x80\x9cin situations where the mitigating and aggravating circumstances are in balance, or, where the mitigating circumstances give the court reservation but still fall below the weight of the aggravating circumstances, the statute bars the court from imposing a sentence less than death\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <em>Walton</em>, 497 U.

Rejecting Walton\xe2\x80\x99s argument, see 497 U. S., at 650, 651, this Court stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as a State\xe2\x80\x99s method of allocating the burdens of proof does not lessen the State\xe2\x80\x99s burden to prove every element of the offense charged, or in this case to prove the existence of aggravating circumstances, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights are not violated by placing on him the burden of proving mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 650.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis Court noted that, as a requirement of individualized sentencing, a jury must have the opportunity to consider all evidence relevant to mitigation, and that a state statute that permits a jury to consider any mitigating evidence comports with that requirement.  <em>Id</em>., at 652 (citing <em>Blystone</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/index.html">494 U. S. 299</a>, 307 (1990)).  The Court also pointedly observed that while the Constitution requires that a sentencing jury have discretion, it does not mandate that discretion be unfettered; the States are free to determine the manner in which a jury may consider mitigating evidence.  497 U. S., at 652 (citing <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a>, 374 (1990)).  So long as the sentencer is not precluded from considering relevant mitigating evidence, a capital sentencing statute cannot be said to impermissibly, much less automatically, impose death.  497 U. S., at 652 (citing <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/280/index.html">428 U.

Indeed, <em>Walton</em> suggested that the only capital sentencing systems that would be impermissibly mandatory were those that would \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically impose death upon conviction for certain types of murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  497 U. S., at 652.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s contentions and the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions, see 278 Kan., at 536\xe2\x80\x93538, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 459, the question presented in the instant case was squarely before this Court in <em>Walton</em>.  Though, as Marsh notes, the <em>Walton</em> Court did not employ the term \xe2\x80\x9cequipoise,\xe2\x80\x9d that issue undeniably gave rise to the question this Court sought to resolve, and it was necessarily included in Walton\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Arizona system was unconstitutional because it required the death penalty unless the mitigating circumstances <em>outweighed</em> the aggravating circumstances.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Moreover, the dissent in <em>Walton </em>reinforces what is evident from the opinion and the judgment of the Court\xe2\x80\x94that the equipoise issue was before the Court, and that the Court resolved the issue in favor of the State.  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9cequipoise\xe2\x80\x9d issue was, in large measure, the basis of the <em>Walton</em> dissent.  See 497 U. S., at 687\xe2\x80\x93688 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the mitigating and aggravating circumstances are in equipoise, the [Arizona] statute requires that the trial judge impose capital punishment.  The assertion that a sentence of death may be imposed in such a case runs directly counter to the Eighth Amendment requirement that a capital sentence must rest upon a \xe2\x80\x98determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, although <em>Walton</em> did not discuss the equipoise issue explicitly, that issue was resolved by its\nholding.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting); cf. also <em>post</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that <em>Walton</em> controls here is reinforced by the fact that the Arizona and Kansas statutes are comparable in important respects.  Similar to the express language of the Kansas statute, the Arizona statute at issue in <em>Walton</em> has been consistently construed to mean that the death penalty will be imposed upon a finding that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See <em>State </em>v.<em> Ysea</em>, 191 Ariz. 372, 375, 956 P. 2d 499, 502 (1998) (en banc); <em>State</em> v. <em>Gretzler</em>, 135 Ariz. 42, 55, 659 P.\xc2\xa02d 1, 14 (1983) (in banc); <em>Adamson</em>, 865 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1041\xe2\x80\x931043.  Like the Kansas statute, the Arizona statute places the burden of proving the existence of aggravating circumstances on the State, and both statutes require the defendant to proffer mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutes are distinct in one respect.  The Arizona statute, once the State has met its burden, tasks the defendant with the burden of proving sufficient mitigating circumstances to overcome the aggravating circumstances and that a sentence less than death is therefore warranted.  In contrast, the Kansas statute requires the State to bear the burden of proving to the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators and that a sentence of death is therefore appropriate; it places no additional evidentiary burden on the capital defendant.  This distinction operates in favor of Kansas capital defendants.  Otherwise the statutes function in substantially the same manner and are sufficiently analogous for our purposes.  Thus, <em>Walton</em> is not distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the reasoning of <em>Walton</em> requires approval of the Kansas death penalty statute.  At bottom, in <em>Walton</em>, the Court held that a state death penalty statute may place the burden on the defendant to prove that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  <em>A fortiori</em>, Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 death penalty statute, consistent with the Constitution, may direct imposition of the death penalty when the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including where the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if, as Marsh contends, <em>Walton</em> does not directly control, the general principles set forth in our death penalty jurisprudence would lead us to conclude that the Kansas capital sentencing system is constitutionally permissible.  Together, our decisions in <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a> (1972) <em>(per curiam),</em> and <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a> (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), establish that a state capital sentencing system must: (1) rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants; and (2) permit a jury to render a reasoned, individualized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible defendant\xe2\x80\x99s record, personal characteristics, and the circumstances of his crime.  See <em>id.,</em> at 189.  So long as a state system satisfies these requirements, our precedents establish that a State enjoys a range of discretion in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are to be weighed.  See <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Lynaugh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/164/index.html">487 U. S. 164</a>, 179 (1988) (plurality opinion) (citing <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U.

See <em>Graham</em> v.<em> Collins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/461/index.html">506 U. S. 461</a>, 484\xe2\x80\x93489 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring) (discussing the development of mitigation precedent).  In <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a>, 604 (1978), a plurality of this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer \xe2\x80\xa6 not be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor</em>, any aspect of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis in original.)  The Court has held that the sentencer must have full access to this \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98highly relevant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d information.  <em>Id</em>., at 603 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Williams</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/241/index.html">337 U. S. 241</a>, 247 (1949)).  Thus, in <em>Lockett</em>, the Court struck down the Ohio death penalty statute as unconstitutional because, by limiting a jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of mitigation to three factors specified in the statute, it prevented sentencers in capital cases from giving independent weight to mitigating evidence militating in favor of a sentence other than death.  438 U. S.<em>,</em> at 604\xe2\x80\x93605.  Following <em>Lockett</em>,<em> </em>in <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U.

The thrust of our mitigation jurisprudence ends here.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have never held that a specific method for balancing mitigating and aggravating factors in a capital sentencing proceeding is constitutionally required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Franklin,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 179 (citing <em>Zant,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 875\xe2\x80\x93876, n. 13).

It does not interfere, in a constitutionally significant way, with a jury\xe2\x80\x99s ability to give independent weight to evidence offered in mitigation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 procedure narrows the universe of death-eligible defendants consistent with Eighth Amendment requirements.  Under Kansas law, imposition of the death penalty is an <em>option</em> only after a defendant is convicted of capital murder, which requires that one or more specific elements beyond intentional premeditated murder be found.  See Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x933439.  Once convicted of capital murder, a defendant becomes <em>eligible</em> for the death penalty only if the State seeks a separate sentencing hearing, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934706(c) (2003 Cum. Supp.), 21\xe2\x80\x934624(a); App. 23 (Instruction No. 2), and proves beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of one or more statutorily enumerated aggravating circumstances.  Kan. Stat.

Specifically, jurors are instructed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA mitigating circumstance is that which in fairness or mercy may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability or blame or which justify a sentence of less than death, although it does not justify or excuse the offense.  The determination of what are mitigating circumstances is for you as jurors to resolve under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be a mitigating factor you may consider in determining whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the death penalty is warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24 (Instruction No. 4).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nJurors are then apprised of, but not limited to, the factors that the defendant contends are mitigating.  <em>Id</em>., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  They are then instructed that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach juror must consider every mitigating factor that he or she individually finds to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 weighing equation, <em>ibid.</em> (Instruction No. 5), merely channels a jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion by providing it with criteria by which it may determine whether a sentence of life or death is appropriate.  The system in Kansas provides the type of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98guided discretion,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Walton</em>, 497 U. S., at 659 (citing<em> Gregg</em>, 428 U. S., at 189), we have sanctioned in <em>Walton</em>,<em> Boyde,</em> and <em>Blystone</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in <em>Boyde</em>, this Court sanctioned a weighing jury instruction that is analytically indistinguishable from the Kansas jury instruction under review today.  The <em>Boyde</em> jury instruction read:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If you conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you <em>shall impose</em> a sentence of death.  However, if you determine that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you <em>shall impose</em> a sentence of confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 374 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBoyde argued that the mandatory language of the instruction prevented the jury from rendering an individualized sentencing determination.  This Court rejected that argument, concluding that it was foreclosed by <em>Blystone</em>, where the Court rejected a nearly identical challenge to the Pennsylvania death penalty statute.  494 U. S., at 307.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In so holding, this Court noted that the mandatory language of the statute did not prevent the jury from <em>considering</em> all relevant mitigating evidence.  <em>Boyde,</em> 494 U. S., at 374.  Similarly here, \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) does not prevent a Kansas jury from considering mitigating evidence.  Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Kansas provision is impermissibly mandatory is likewise foreclosed.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s argument, \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) does not create a general presumption in favor of the death penalty in the State of Kansas.  Rather, the Kansas capital sentencing system is dominated by the presumption that life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence for a capital conviction.  If the State fails to meet its burden to demonstrate the existence of an aggravating circumstance(s) beyond a reasonable doubt, a sentence of life imprisonment must be imposed.  \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e); App. 27 (Instruction No. 10).  If the State overcomes this hurdle, then it bears the additional burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances.  <em>Ibid.</em>  (Instruction No. 10); <em>id</em>., at 26 (Instruction No. 5).  Significantly, although the defendant appropriately bears the burden of proffering mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x94a burden of production\xe2\x80\x94he never bears the burden of demonstrating that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  Instead, the State always has the burden of demonstrating that mitigating evidence does not outweigh aggravating evidence.  Absent the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to meet that burden, the default is life imprisonment.  Moreover, if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision\xe2\x80\x94in any respect\xe2\x80\x94a sentence of life must be imposed.  \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(c); App. 28 (Instruction No. 12).  This system does not create a presumption that death is the appropriate sentence for capital murder.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any force behind Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s contention that an equipoise determination reflects juror confusion or inability to decide between life and death, or that a jury may use equipoise as a loophole to shirk its constitutional duty to render a reasoned, moral decision, see <em>California</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/index.html">479 U. S. 538</a>, 545 (1987) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring), regarding whether death is an appropriate sentence for a particular defendant.  Such an argument rests on an implausible characterization of the Kansas statute\xe2\x80\x94that a jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that aggravators and mitigators are in equipoise is not a <em>decision</em>, much less a decision <em>for death</em>\xe2\x80\x94and thus misses the mark.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Souter, J., dissenting) (arguing that Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 weighing equation undermines individualized sentencing).  Weighing is not an end; it is merely a means to reaching a decision.  The decision the jury must reach is whether life or death is the appropriate punishment.  The Kansas jury instructions clearly inform the jury that a determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a decision for\xe2\x80\x94not a presumption in favor of\xe2\x80\x94death.  Kansas jurors, presumed to follow their instructions, are made aware that: a determination that mitigators outweigh aggravators is a decision that a life sentence is appropriate; a determination that aggravators outweigh mitigators <em>or </em>a determination that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators\xe2\x80\x94including a finding that aggravators and mitigators are in balance\xe2\x80\x94is a decision that death is the appropriate sentence; and an inability to reach a unanimous decision will result in a sentence of life imprisonment.  So informed, far from the abdication of duty or the inability to select an appropriate sentence depicted by Marsh and Justice Souter, a jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that aggravating evidence and mitigating evidence are in equipoise is a <em>decision for death</em> and is indicative of the type of measured, normative process in which a jury is constitutionally tasked to engage when deciding the appropriate sentence for a capital defendant.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter argues (hereinafter the dissent) that the advent of DNA testing has resulted in the \xe2\x80\x9cexoneratio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent\xe2\x80\x9d persons \xe2\x80\x9cin numbers never imagined before the development of DNA tests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Based upon this \xe2\x80\x9cnew empirical demonstration of how \xe2\x80\x98death is different,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8, the dissent concludes that Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing system permits the imposition of the death penalty in the absence of reasoned moral judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the availability of DNA testing, and the questions it might raise about the accuracy of guilt-phase determinations in capital cases, is simply irrelevant to the question before the Court today, namely, the constitutionality of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 capital <em>sentencing</em> system.  Accordingly, the accuracy of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s factual claim that DNA testing has established the \xe2\x80\x9cinnocence\xe2\x80\x9d of numerous convicted persons under death sentences\xe2\x80\x94and the incendiary debate it invokes\xe2\x80\x94is beyond the scope of this opinion.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s general criticisms against the death penalty are ultimately a call for resolving all legal disputes in capital cases by adopting the outcome that makes the death penalty more difficult to impose.  While such a bright-line rule may be easily applied, it has no basis in law.  Indeed, the logical consequence of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that the death penalty can only be just in a system that does not permit error.  Because the criminal justice system does not operate perfectly, abolition of the death penalty is the only answer to the moral dilemma the dissent poses.  This Court, however, does not sit as a moral authority.  Our precedents do not prohibit the States from authorizing the death penalty, even in our imperfect system.

S. 992</a>, 1031 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting)).  But that is true, of course, of almost our entire docket; it is in the very nature of certiorari jurisdiction.  Also self-evident, since the jurisdiction of the Kansas Supreme Court ends at the borders of that State, is the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]o other State would have been required to follow the [Kansas] precedent if it had been permitted to stand.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Ramos</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1031 (Stevens, J., dissenting)).  But if this signaled the impropriety of granting certiorari, we would never review state-court determinations of federal law, even though they patently contradict (as the determination below does) the holdings of other state courts and Federal Courts of Appeals, compare<em> </em>278 Kan. 520, 534\xe2\x80\x93537, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d 445, 457\xe2\x80\x93459 (2004) (case below), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Kleypas</em>, 272 Kan. 894, 1005\xe2\x80\x931007, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 139, 225\xe2\x80\x93226 (2001), with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoffman</em>, 123 Idaho 638, 646\xe2\x80\x93647, 851 P.\xc2\xa02d 934, 942\xe2\x80\x93943 (1993), and<em> Jones </em>v. <em>Dugger</em>, 928 F.\xc2\xa02d 1020, 1029 (CA11 1991)\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, even when they patently contradict our own decisions.  Our principal responsibility under current practice, however, and a primary basis for the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s allowing us to be accorded jurisdiction to review state-court decisions, see Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72, cls. 1 and 2, is to ensure the integrity and uniformity of federal law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10(b), (c).  Fulfillment of this responsibility is, to put it mildly, an adequate answer to the charge that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]othing more than an interest in facilitating the imposition of the death penalty in [Kansas] justified this Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its discretion to review the judgment of the [Kansas] Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Ramos</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1031 (Stevens, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that our holding in <em>Ramos</em> was \xe2\x80\x9cironi[c],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Stevens, J.), rests on a misguided view of federalism and, worse still, of a republican form of government.  Only that can explain the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that <em>Ramos</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>reversal of a state-court determination somehow undermined state authority.  The California Supreme Court had ruled that a jury instruction inserted into the state penal code by voter initiative, see 463 U. S., at 995, n.\xc2\xa04, was invalid <em>as a matter of federal constitutional law</em>.  See <em>id.</em>, at 996, 997, n.\xc2\xa07.  When state courts erroneously invalidate actions<em> </em>taken by the people of a State (through initiative or through normal operation of the political branches of their state government) on <em>state-law </em>grounds, it is generally none of our business; and our displacing of those judgments would indeed be an intrusion upon state autonomy.  But when state courts erroneously invalidate such actions because they believe federal law requires it\xe2\x80\x94and <em>especially </em>when they do so because they believe the Federal <em>Constitution </em>requires it\xe2\x80\x94review by this Court, far from <em>undermining </em>state autonomy, is the only possible way to <em>vindicate </em>it.  When a federal constitutional interdict against the duly expressed will of the people of a State is erroneously pronounced by a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, no authority in the State\xe2\x80\x94not even a referendum agreed to by all its citizens\xe2\x80\x94can undo the error.  Thus, a general presumption against such review displays not respect for the States, but a complacent willingness to allow judges to strip the people of the power to govern themselves.  When we correct a state court\xe2\x80\x99s federal errors, <em>we return power</em> <em>to the State, and to its people</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why our decision in <em>Ramos </em>was necessary.  Our solemn responsibility is not merely to determine whether a State Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] adequately protected [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] rights under the Federal Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It is to ensure that when courts speak in the name of the Federal Constitution, they disregard none of its guarantees\xe2\x80\x94neither those that assure the rights of criminal defendants, nor those that assure what Justice Black, in his famous dissent in <em>In re Winship,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/index.html">397 U. S. 358</a>, 385 (1970), called \xe2\x80\x9cthe most fundamental individual liberty of our people\xe2\x80\x94the right of each man to participate in the self-government of his society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Turning a blind eye to federal constitutional error that benefits criminal defendants, allowing it to permeate in varying fashion each state Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence, would change the uniform \xe2\x80\x9claw of the land\xe2\x80\x9d into a crazy quilt.  And on top of it all, of course, what the dissent proposes avowedly favors one party to the case: When a criminal defendant loses a questionable constitutional point, we may grant review; when the State loses, we must deny it.  While it might be appropriate for Congress to place such a thumb upon the scales of our power to review, it seems to me a peculiar mode of decisionmaking for judges sworn to \xe2\x80\x9cimpartially discharge \xe2\x80\xa6 all the duties\xe2\x80\x9d of their office, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7453.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision to grant certiorari is guided by the considerations set forth in Rule 10.  None of them turns on the identity of the party that the asserted misapplication of federal law has harmed.  When state legislation is thwarted\xe2\x80\x94not on the basis of state law, but on the basis of a questionable application of the Federal Constitution or laws\xe2\x80\x94I shall continue to vote to grant the resulting petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I must say a few words (indeed, more than a few) in response to Part III of Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.  This contains the disclaimer that the dissenters are not (<em>yet</em>)<em> </em>ready to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneraliz[e] about the soundness of capital sentencing across the country,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9; but that is in fact precisely what they do.  The dissent essentially argues that capital punishment is such an undesirable institution\xe2\x80\x94it results in the condemnation of such a large number of innocents\xe2\x80\x94that any legal rule which eliminates its pronouncement, including the one favored by the dissenters in the present case, should be embraced.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general rule, I do not think it appropriate for judges to heap either praise or censure upon a legislative measure that comes before them, lest it be thought that their validation, invalidation, or interpretation of it is driven by their desire to expand or constrict what they personally approve or disapprove as a matter of policy.  In the present case, for example, people might leap to the conclusion that the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 views on whether Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s equipoise rule is constitutional are determined by their personal disapproval of an institution that has been democratically adopted by 38 States and the United States.  But of course that requires no leap; just a willingness to take the dissenters at their word.  For as I have described, the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 very argument is that imposition of the death penalty should be minimized by invalidation of the equipoise rule because it is a bad, \xe2\x80\x9crisk[y],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chazard[ous]\xe2\x80\x9d idea, <em>ibid</em>.  A broader conclusion that people should derive, however (and I would not consider this much of a leap either), is that the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 encumbering of the death penalty in <em>other</em> cases, with unwarranted restrictions neither contained in the text of the Constitution nor reflected in two centuries of practice under it, will be the product of their policy views\xe2\x80\x94views not shared by the vast majority of the American people.  The dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 proclamation of their policy agenda in the present case is especially striking because it is nailed to the door of the wrong church\xe2\x80\x94that is, set forth in a case litigating a rule that has nothing to do with the evaluation of guilt or innocence.  There are, of course, many cases in which the rule at issue <em>does </em>serve that function, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>House</em> v. <em>Bell,</em> 547 U. S. ___ (2006).  (Marsh himself has earned a remand by application of one such rule, see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.)  But as the Court observes, see <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, guilt or innocence is logically disconnected to the challenge in <em>this </em>case to <em>sentencing </em>standards.  The <em>only </em>time the equipoise provision is relevant is when the State has proved a defendant guilty of a capital crime.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There exists in some parts of the world sanctimonious criticism of America\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty, as somehow unworthy of a civilized society.  (I say sanctimonious, because most of the countries to which these finger-waggers belong had the death penalty themselves until recently\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, many of them would still have it if the democratic will prevailed.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>])  It is a certainty that the opinion of a near-majority of the United States Supreme Court to the effect that our system condemns many innocent defendants to death will be trumpeted abroad as vindication of these criticisms.  For that reason, I take the trouble to point out that the dissenting opinion has nothing substantial to support it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should be noted at the outset that the dissent does not discuss a single case\xe2\x80\x94not one\xe2\x80\x94in which it is clear that a person was executed for a crime he did not commit.  If such an event had occurred in recent years, we would not have to hunt for it; the innocent\xe2\x80\x99s name would be shouted from the rooftops by the abolition lobby.  The dissent makes much of the new-found capacity of DNA testing to establish innocence.  But in every case of an executed defendant of which I am aware, that technology has <em>confirmed </em>guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This happened, for instance, only a few months ago in the case of Roger Coleman.  Coleman was convicted of the gruesome rape and murder of his sister-in-law, but he persuaded many that he was actually innocent and became the poster-child for the abolitionist lobby.  See Glod &amp; Shear, DNA Tests Confirm Guilt of Man Executed by Va., Washington Post, Jan. 13, 2006, p. A1; Dao, DNA Ties Man Executed in \xe2\x80\x9992 to the Murder He Denied, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Jan. 13, 2006, p. A14.  Around the time of his eventual execution, \xe2\x80\x9chis picture was on the cover of Time magazine (\xe2\x80\x98This Man Might Be Innocent.  This Man Is Due to Die\xe2\x80\x99).  He was interviewed from death row on \xe2\x80\x98Larry King Live,\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98Today\xe2\x80\x99 show, \xe2\x80\x98Primetime Live,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Good Morning America\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The Phil Donahue Show.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Frankel, Burden of Proof, Washington Post, May 14, 2006, pp. W8, W11.  Even one Justice of this Court, in an opinion filed shortly before the execution, cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9cColeman has now produced substantial evidence that he may be innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to die.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/188/index.html">504 U. S. 188</a>, 189 (1992)<em> </em>(Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Coleman ultimately failed a lie-detector test offered by the Governor of Virginia as a condition of a possible stay; he was executed on May 20, 1992.  Frankel, <em>supra</em>, at W23; Glod &amp; Shear, Warner Orders DNA Testing in Case of Man Executed in \xe2\x80\x9992, Washington Post, Jan. 6, 2006, pp. A1, A6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years since then, Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s case became a rallying point for abolitionists, who hoped it would offer what they consider the \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Grail: proof from a test tube that an innocent person had been executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Frankel, <em>supra</em>, at W24.  But earlier this year, a DNA test ordered by a later Governor of Virginia proved that Coleman was guilty, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Glod &amp; Shear, DNA Tests Confirm Guilt of Man Executed by Va., <em>supra</em>, at A1; Dao, <em>supra</em>, at A14, even though his defense team had \xe2\x80\x9cproved\xe2\x80\x9d his innocence and had even identified \xe2\x80\x9cthe real killer\xe2\x80\x9d (with whom they eventually settled a defamation suit).  See Frankel, <em>supra, </em>at W23.  And Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s case is not unique.  See Truth and Consequences: The Penalty of Death, in Debating the Death Penalty: Should America Have Capital Punishment? The Experts on Both Sides Make Their Best Case, 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (H. Bedau &amp; P. Cassell eds. 2004) (discussing the cases of supposed innocents Rick McGinn and Derek Barnabei, whose guilt was also confirmed by DNA tests).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of identifying and discussing any particular case or cases of mistaken execution, the dissent simply cites a handful of studies that bemoan the alleged prevalence of wrongful death sentences.  One study (by Lanier and Acker) is quoted by the dissent as claiming that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98more than 110\xe2\x80\x99 death row prisoners have been released since 1973 upon findings that they were innocent of the crimes charged, and \xe2\x80\x98hundreds of additional wrongful convictions in potentially capital cases have been documented over the past century.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (opinion of Souter, J.).  For the first point, Lanier and Acker cite the work of the Death Penalty Information Center (more about that below) and an article in a law review jointly authored by Radelet, Lofquist, and Bedau (two professors of sociology and a professor of philosophy).  For the second point, they cite only a 1987 article by Bedau and Radelet.  See Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases, 40 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 21.  In the very same paragraph which the dissent quotes, Lanier and Acker also refer to that 1987 article as \xe2\x80\x9chav[ing] identified 23 individuals who, in their judgment, were convicted and executed in this country during the 20th century notwithstanding their innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lanier &amp; Acker, Capital Punishment, the Moratorium Movement, and Empirical Questions, 10 Psychology, Public Policy &amp; Law 577, 593 (2004).  This 1987 article has been highly influential in the abolitionist world.  Hundreds of academic articles, including those relied on by today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, have cited it.  It also makes its appearance in judicial decisions\xe2\x80\x94cited recently in a six-judge dissent in <em>House </em>v. <em>Bell</em>, 386 F.\xc2\xa03d 668, 708 (CA6 2004) (en banc) (Merritt, J., dissenting), for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe system is allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  The article therefore warrants some further observations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1987 article\xe2\x80\x99s obsolescence began at the moment of publication.  The most recent executions it considered were in 1984, 1964, and 1951; the rest predate the Allied victory in World War II.  (Two of the supposed innocents are Sacco and Vanzetti.)  Bedau &amp; Radelet, <em>supra</em>, at 73.  Even if the innocence claims made in this study were true, all except (perhaps) the 1984 example would cast no light upon the functioning of our current system of capital adjudication.  The legal community\xe2\x80\x99s general attitude toward criminal defendants, the legal protections States afford, the constitutional guarantees this Court enforces, and the scope of federal habeas review, are all vastly different from what they were in 1961.  So are the scientific means of establishing guilt, and hence innocence\xe2\x80\x94which are now so striking in their operation and effect that they are the subject of more than one popular TV series.  (One of these new means, of course, is DNA testing\xe2\x80\x94which the dissent seems to think is primarily a way to identify defendants erroneously convicted, rather than a highly effective way to avoid conviction of the innocent.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But their current relevance aside, this study\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions are unverified.  And if the support for its most significant conclusion\xe2\x80\x94the execution of 23 innocents in the 20th century\xe2\x80\x94is any indication of its accuracy, neither it, nor any study so careless as to rely upon it, is worthy of credence.  The only execution of an innocent man it alleges to have occurred after the restoration of the death penalty in 1976\xe2\x80\x94the Florida execution of James Adams in 1984\xe2\x80\x94is the easiest case to verify.  As evidence of Adams\xe2\x80\x99 innocence, it describes a hair that could not have been his as being \xe2\x80\x9cclutched in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Bedau &amp; Radelet, <em>supra</em>, at 91<em>.</em>  The hair was <em>not </em>in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s hand; \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t was a remnant of a sweeping of the ambulance and so could have come from another source.\xe2\x80\x9d  Markman &amp; Cassell, Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet Study, 41 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 121, 131 (1988).  The study also claims that a witness who \xe2\x80\x9cheard a voice inside the victim\xe2\x80\x99s home at the time of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d testified that the \xe2\x80\x9cvoice was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Bedau &amp; Radelet, <em>supra</em>, at 91.  The witness\xe2\x80\x99s actual testimony was that the voice, which said \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (and was hence unlikely to have been the voice of anyone but the male victim), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sounded \xe2\x80\x9ckind of like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, kind of like strangling or something \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Markman &amp; Cassell, Protecting the Innocent, at 130.  Bedau and Radelet failed to mention that upon arrest on the afternoon of the murder Adams was found with some $200 in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94one bill of which \xe2\x80\x9cwas stained with type O blood.  When Adams was asked about the blood on the money, he said that it came from a cut on his finger.  His blood was type AB, however, while the victim\xe2\x80\x99s was type O.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 132.  Among the other unmentioned, incriminating details: that the victim\xe2\x80\x99s <em>eyeglasses </em>were found in Adams\xe2\x80\x99 car, along with jewelry belonging to the victim, and clothing of Adams\xe2\x80\x99 stained with type O blood.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This is just a sample of the evidence arrayed against this \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 128\xe2\x80\x93133, 148\xe2\x80\x93150.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Critics have questioned the study\xe2\x80\x99s findings with regard to all its other cases of execution of alleged innocents for which \xe2\x80\x9cappellate opinions \xe2\x80\xa6 set forth the facts proved at trial in detail sufficient to permit a neutral observer to assess the validity of the authors\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 134.  (For the rest, there was not \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonably complete account of the facts \xe2\x80\xa6 readily available,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 145.)  As to those cases, the only readily verifiable ones, the authors of the 1987 study later acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cWe agree with our critics that we have not \xe2\x80\x98proved\xe2\x80\x99 these executed defendants to be innocent; we never claimed that we had.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bedau &amp; Radelet, The Myth of Infallibility: A Reply to Markman and Cassell, 41 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 161, 164 (1988).  One would have hoped that this disclaimer of the study\xe2\x80\x99s most striking conclusion, if not the study\xe2\x80\x99s dubious methodology, would have prevented it from being cited as authority in the pages of the United\xc2\xa0States Reports.  But alas, it is too late for that.  Although today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent relies on the study only indirectly, the two dissenters who were on the Court in January 1993 have already embraced it.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne impressive study,\xe2\x80\x9d they noted (referring to the 1987 study), \xe2\x80\x9chas concluded that 23 innocent people have been executed in the United States in this century, including one as recently as 1984.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herrera</em> v. <em>Collins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/390/index.html"></a><a href="/us/506/390/index.html">506 U. S. 390</a>, 430, n. 1 (1993) (Blackmun, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ., dissenting).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Remarkably avoiding any claim of erroneous executions, the dissent focuses on the large numbers of <em>non</em>-executed \xe2\x80\x9cexonerees\xe2\x80\x9d paraded by various professors.  It speaks as though exoneration came about through the operation of some outside force to correct the mistakes of our legal system, rather than <em>as a consequence of the functioning of our legal system.  </em>Reversal of an erroneous conviction on appeal or on habeas, or the pardoning of an innocent condemnee through executive clemency, demonstrates not the failure of the system but its success.  Those devices are part and parcel of the multiple assurances that are applied before a death sentence is carried out.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course even in identifying exonerees, the dissent is willing to accept anybody\xe2\x80\x99s say-so.  It engages in no critical review, but merely parrots articles or reports that support its attack on the American criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0The dissent places significant weight, for instance, on the Illinois Report (compiled by the appointees of an Illinois Governor who had declared a moratorium upon the death penalty and who eventually commuted all death sentences in the State, see Warden, Illinois Death Penalty Reform: How It Happened, What It Promises, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 381, 406\xe2\x80\x93407, 410 (2006)), which it claims shows that \xe2\x80\x9cfalse verdicts\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cremarkable in number.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 9 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The dissent claims that this Report identifies 13 inmates released from death row after they were determined to be innocent.  To take one of these cases, discussed by the dissent as an example of a judgment \xe2\x80\x9cas close to innocence as any judgments courts normally render,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 7, n.\xc2\xa02: In <em>People </em>v.<em> Smith</em>, 185 Ill. 2d 532, 708 N. E. 2d 365 (1999) the defendant was twice convicted of murder.  After his first trial, the Supreme Court of Illinois \xe2\x80\x9creversed [his] conviction based upon certain evidentiary errors\xe2\x80\x9d and remanded his case for a new trial.  <em>Id</em>., at 534, 708 N. E. 2d, at 366.  The second jury convicted Smith again.  The Supreme Court of Illinois again reversed the conviction because it found that the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.</em>, at 542\xe2\x80\x93543, 708 N. E. 2d, at 370\xe2\x80\x93371.  The court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhile a not guilty finding is sometimes equated with a finding of innocence, that conclusion is erroneous.  Courts do not find people guilty or innocent. . . . A not guilty verdict expresses no view as to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s innocence. Rather, [a reversal of conviction] indicates simply that the prosecution has failed to meet its burden of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 545, 708 N. E. 2d, at 371.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis case alone suffices to refute the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Illinois Report distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9cexoneration of a convict because of actual innocence, and reversal of a judgment because of legal error affecting conviction or sentence but not inconsistent with guilt in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 7, n.\xc2\xa02.  The broader point, however, is that it is utterly impossible to regard \xe2\x80\x9cexoneration\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94however casually defined\xe2\x80\x94as a failure of the capital justice system, rather than as a vindication of its effectiveness in releasing not only defendants who are innocent, but those whose guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s leading authorities on exoneration of the innocent is Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, &amp; Patil, Exonerations in the United States 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 523 (2006) (hereinafter Gross).  The dissent quotes that study\xe2\x80\x99s self-congratulatory \xe2\x80\x9ccriteria\xe2\x80\x9d of exoneration\xe2\x80\x94seemingly so rigorous that no one could doubt the study\xe2\x80\x99s reliability.  See <em>post</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa03 (opinion of Souter, J.).  But in fact that article, like the others cited, is notable not for its rigorous investigation and analysis, but for the fervor of its belief that the American justice system is condemning the innocent \xe2\x80\x9cin numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d as the dissent puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cnever imagined before the development of DNA tests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Among the article\xe2\x80\x99s list of 74 \xe2\x80\x9cexonerees,\xe2\x80\x9d Gross 529, is Jay Smith of Pennsylvania.  Smith\xe2\x80\x94a school principal\xe2\x80\x94earned three death sentences for slaying one of his teachers and her two young children.  See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Holtz</em>, 210 F.\xc2\xa03d 186, 188 (CA3 2000).  His retrial for triple murder was barred on double jeopardy grounds because of prosecutorial misconduct during the first trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at 194.  But Smith could not leave well enough alone.  He had the gall to sue, under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, for false imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the jury verdict for the defendants, observing along the way that \xe2\x80\x9cour confidence in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s convictions is not diminished in the least.  We remain firmly convinced of the integrity of those guilty verdicts.\xe2\x80\x9d  210 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 198.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another \xe2\x80\x9cexonerated\xe2\x80\x9d murderer in the Gross study is Jeremy Sheets, convicted in Nebraska.  His accomplice in the rape and murder of a girl had been secretly tape recorded; he \xe2\x80\x9cadmitted that he drove the car used in the murder \xe2\x80\xa6 , and implicated Sheets in the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Butera</em>, 389 F.\xc2\xa03d 772, 775 (CA8 2004).  The accomplice was arrested and eventually described the murder in greater detail, after which a plea agreement was arranged, conditioned on the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s full cooperation.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The resulting taped confession, which implicated Sheets, was \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he crucial portion of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sheets</em>, 260 Neb. 325, 327, 618 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 117, 122 (2000).  But the accomplice committed suicide in jail, depriving Sheets of the opportunity to cross-examine him.  This, the Nebraska Supreme Court held, rendered the evidence inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 328, 335\xe2\x80\x93351, 618 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 123, 127\xe2\x80\x93136.  After the central evidence was excluded, the State did not retry Sheets.  <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Butera</em>, 389 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 776.  Sheets brought a \xc2\xa71983 claim; the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment against him.  <em>Id.</em>, at 780.  Sheets also sought the $1,000 he had been required to pay to the Nebraska Victim\xe2\x80\x99s Compensation Fund; the State Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94far from concluding that Sheets had been \xe2\x80\x9cexonerated\xe2\x80\x9d and was entitled to the money\xe2\x80\x94refused to return it.  The court action left open the possibility that Sheets could be retried, and the Attorney General did \xe2\x80\x9cnot believe the reversal on the ground of improper admission of evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 is a favorable disposition of charges,\xe2\x80\x9d Neb. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 01036 (Nov. 9), 2001 WL 1503144, *3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its inflation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cexoneration,\xe2\x80\x9d the Gross article hardly stands alone; mischaracterization of\nreversible error as actual innocence is endemic in\nabolitionist rhetoric, and other prominent catalogues of \xe2\x80\x9cinnocence\xe2\x80\x9d in the death-penalty context suffer from\nthe same defect.  Perhaps the best-known of them is\nthe List of Those Freed From Death Row, maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.  See http://www.\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=6&amp;did=110.  This includes the cases from the Gross article described above, but also enters some dubious candidates of its own.  Delbert Tibbs is one of them.  We considered his case in <em>Tibbs</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/31/index.html">457 U. S. 31</a> (1982), concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial when a conviction is \xe2\x80\x9crevers[ed] based on the weight, rather than the sufficiency, of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 32.  The case involved a man and a woman hitchhiking together in Florida.  A driver who picked them up sodomized and raped the woman, and killed her boyfriend.  She eventually escaped and positively identified Tibbs.  See <em>id.</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed the conviction on a 4-to-3 vote.  337 So.\xc2\xa02d 788 (1976).  The Florida courts then grappled with whether Tibbs could be retried without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court determined not only that there was no double-jeopardy problem, 397 So.\xc2\xa02d 1120, 1127 (1981) <em>(per curiam),</em> but that the <em>very basis on which it had reversed the conviction was no longer valid law</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 1125, and that its action in \xe2\x80\x9creweigh[ing] the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in Tibbs\xe2\x80\x99 case had been \xe2\x80\x9cclearly improper,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1126.  After we affirmed the Florida Supreme Court, however, the State felt compelled to drop the charges.  The State Attorney explained this to the Florida Commission on Capital Cases: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98By the time of the retrial, [the] witness/victim \xe2\x80\xa6 had progressed from a marijuana smoker to a crack user and I could not put her up on the stand, so I declined to prosecute.  Tibbs, in my opinion, was never an innocent man wrongfully accused.  He was a lucky human being.  He was guilty, he was lucky and now he is free.  His 1974 conviction was not a miscarriage of justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida Commission on Capital Cases, Case Histories: A Review of 24 Individuals Released From Death Row 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (rev. Sept. 10, 2002) http://www.floridacapitalcases.state.fl.us/\nPublications/innocentsproject.pdf.  Other state officials involved made similar points.  <em>Id.</em>, at 137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, even with its distorted concept of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cexoneration,\xe2\x80\x9d the claims of the Gross article are fairly modest: Between 1989 and 2003, the authors identify 340 \xe2\x80\x9cexonerations\xe2\x80\x9d <em>nationwide</em>\xe2\x80\x94not just for capital cases, mind you, nor even just for murder convictions, but for various felonies.  Gross 529.  Joshua Marquis, a district attorney in Oregon, recently responded to this article as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[L]et\xe2\x80\x99s give the professor the benefit of the doubt: let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that he understated the number of innocents by roughly a factor of 10, that instead of 340 there were 4,000 people in prison who weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in the crime in any way.  During that same 15 years, there were more than 15 million felony convictions across the country.  That would make the error rate .027 percent\xe2\x80\x94or, to put it another way, a success rate of 99.973 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Innocent and the Shammed, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Jan. 26, 2006, p. A23.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that capital defendants are <em>especially </em>liable to suffer from the lack of 100% perfection in our criminal justice system is implausible.  Capital cases are given especially close scrutiny at every level, which is why in most cases many years elapse before the sentence is executed.  And of course capital cases receive special attention in the application of executive clemency.  Indeed, one of the arguments made by abolitionists is that the process of finally completing all the appeals and reexaminations of capital sentences is so lengthy, and thus so expensive for the State, that the game is not worth the candle.  The proof of the pudding, of course, is that as far as anyone can determine (and many are looking), <em>none </em>of cases included in the .027% error rate for American verdicts involved a capital defendant erroneously executed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 1976 there have been approximately a half million murders in the United States.  In that time, 7,000 murderers have been sentenced to death; about 950 of them have been executed; and about 3,700 inmates are currently on death row.   See Marquis, The Myth of Innocence, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 501, 518 (2006).  As a consequence of the sensitivity of the criminal justice system to the due-process rights of defendants sentenced to death, almost two-thirds of all death sentences are overturned.  See <em>ibid</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cVirtually none\xe2\x80\x9d of these reversals, however, are attributable to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actual innocence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Most are based on legal errors that have little or nothing to do with guilt.  See <em>id.</em>, at 519\xe2\x80\x93520.  The studies cited by the dissent demonstrate nothing more.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like other human institutions, courts and juries are not perfect.  One cannot have a system of criminal punishment without accepting the possibility that someone will be punished mistakenly.  That is a truism, not a revelation.  But with regard to the punishment of death in the current American system, that possibility has been reduced to an insignificant minimum.  This explains why those ideologically driven to ferret out and proclaim a mistaken modern execution have not a single verifiable case to point to, whereas it is easy as pie to identify plainly guilty murderers who have been set free.  The American people have determined that the good to be derived from capital punishment\xe2\x80\x94in deterrence, and perhaps most of all in the meting out of condign justice for horrible crimes\xe2\x80\x94outweighs the risk of error.  It is no proper part of the business of this Court, or of its Justices, to second-guess that judgment, much less to impugn it before the world, and less still to frustrate it by imposing judicially invented obstacles to its execution.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent observes that Congress did not initially grant us the full jurisdiction that the Constitution authorizes, but only allowed us to review cases <em>rejecting </em>the assertion of governing federal law.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, n.\xc2\xa0(opinion of Stevens, J.).  That is unsurprising and immaterial.  The original Constitution contained few guarantees of individual rights against the States, and in clashes of governmental authority there was small risk that the state courts would erroneously side with the new Federal Government.  (In 1789, when the first Judiciary Act was passed, the Bill of Rights had not yet been adopted, and once it was, it did not apply against the States, see <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore,</em> 7 Pet. 243 (1833).)  Congress would have been most unlikely to contemplate that state courts would erroneously invalidate state actions on federal grounds.  The early history of our jurisdiction assuredly does not support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s awarding of special preference to the constitutional rights of criminal defendants.  Even with respect to <em>federal </em>defendants (who <em>did </em>enjoy the protections of the Bill of Rights), \xe2\x80\x9cduring the first 100 years of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s existence there was no provision made by Congress for Supreme Court review of federal criminal convictions, an omission that Congress did not remedy until 1889 and beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, &amp; K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 66 (8th ed. 2002).  In any case, <em>present </em>law is plain.  The 1988 statute cited by the dissent and forming the basis of our current certiorari jurisdiction places States and defendants in precisely the same position.  They are both entitled to petition for our review.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Not only are the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s views on the erroneous imposition of the death penalty irrelevant to the present case, but the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed holding on the equipoise issue will not necessarily work to defendants\xe2\x80\x99 advantage.  The equipoise provision of the Kansas statute imposes the death penalty only when the State proves <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> that mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravators.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2.  If we were to disallow Kansas\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, the State could, as Marsh freely admits, replace it with a scheme requiring the State to prove <em>by</em> <em>a mere preponderance of the evidence</em> that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators.  See Tr. of Oral Rearg. 36.  I doubt that any defense counsel would accept this trade.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance\xe2\x80\x9d rule, while it sounds better, would almost surely produce more death sentences than an \xe2\x80\x9cequipoise beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is commonly recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any European countries \xe2\x80\xa6 abolished the death penalty in spite of public opinion rather than because of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bibas, Transparency and Participation in Criminal Procedure, 81 N.\xc2\xa0Y.

S. 639</a>, 649\xe2\x80\x93652 (1990), I necessarily also subscribe to the views expressed by Justice Souter today.  I write separately for two reasons: to explain why agreement with Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s dissent is fully consistent with refusing to read <em>Walton</em> as \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol[ling],\xe2\x80\x9d but see <em>ante,</em> at 5 (opinion of the Court), and to explain why the grant of certiorari in this case was a misuse of our discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of Arizona law, <em>Walton</em> did present exactly the same issue before us today.  The Arizona statute at issue required the judge to impose death upon finding aggravating factors if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  497 U. S., at 644 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(E) (West 1989)).  In Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s view, Arizona case law indicated \xe2\x80\x9cthat a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence will be deemed \xe2\x80\x98sufficiently substantial to call for leniency\xe2\x80\x99 only if the mitigating factors \xe2\x80\x98outweigh\xe2\x80\x99 those in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d  497 U. S., at 687.  Accordingly, Justice Blackmun believed that we confronted the constitutionality of a statute that mandated death when the scales were evenly balanced.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Justice Blackmun never concluded that the plurality similarly read Arizona case law as \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] a capital sentence in a case where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are evenly balanced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 688.  To the contrary, he observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plurality does not even acknowledge that this is the dispositive question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Because Justice Blackmun did not read the plurality opinion as confronting the problem of equipoise that he believed Arizona law to present, my join of his dissent is consistent with my conclusion that <em>stare decisis</em> does not bind us today.  As Justice Souter explains, <em>post</em>, at 2, n. 1, the <em>Walton</em> plurality painstakingly avoided an express endorsement of a rule that allows a prosecutor to argue, and allows a judge to instruct the jury, that if the scales are evenly balanced when the choice is between life and death, the law requires the more severe penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a further difference between this case and <em>Walton</em>\xe2\x80\x94one that should have kept us from granting certiorari in the first place.  In <em>Walton</em>, the defendant petitioned for certiorari, and our grant enabled us to consider whether the Arizona Supreme Court had adequately protected his rights under the Federal Constitution.  In this case, by contrast, the State of Kansas petitioned us to review a ruling of its own Supreme Court on the grounds that the Kansas court had granted more protection to a Kansas litigant than the Federal Constitution required.  A policy of judicial restraint would allow the highest court of the State to be the final decisionmaker in a case of this kind.  See <em>Brigham City</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, 547 U. S. __, __ (2006) (Stevens, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a remarkable similarity between the decision to grant certiorari in this case and our comparable decision in <em>California</em> v. <em>Ramos,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/992/index.html">463 U. S. 992</a> (1983).  In <em>Ramos, </em>we reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had invalidated a standard jury instruction concerning the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s power to commute life without parole sentences\xe2\x80\x94an instruction that was unique to California.  By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court reversed the judgment of the state court, concluding\xe2\x80\x94somewhat ironically\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthe wisdom of the decision to permit juror consideration of possible commutation is best left to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1014.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response I asked, as I do again today, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat harm would have been done to the administration of justice by state courts if the [Kansas] court had been left undisturbed in its determination[?]\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1030.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were true that this instruction may make the difference between life and death in a case in which the scales are otherwise evenly balanced, that is a reason why the instruction should not be given\xe2\x80\x94not a reason for giving it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how trivial the impact of the instruction may be, it is fundamentally wrong for the presiding judge at the trial\xe2\x80\x94who should personify the evenhanded administration of justice\xe2\x80\x94to tell the jury, indirectly to be sure, that doubt concerning the proper penalty should be resolved in favor of [death].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Ramos,</em> in this case \xe2\x80\x9cno rule of law commanded the Court to grant certiorari.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1031.  Furthermore, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o other State would have been required to follow the [Kansas] precedent if it had been permitted to stand.  Nothing more than an interest in facilitating the imposition of the death penalty in [Kansas] justified this Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its discretion to review the judgment of the [Kansas] Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat interest, in my opinion, is not sufficient to warrant this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the validity of a jury instruction when the wisdom of giving that instruction is plainly a matter that is best left to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decided <em>Ramos</em> on the same day as <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a> (1983).  Prior to that time, \xe2\x80\x9cwe had virtually no interest\xe2\x80\x9d in criminal cases where States sought to set aside the rulings of their own courts.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1069 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Although in recent years the trend has been otherwise, I continue to hope \xe2\x80\x9cthat a future Court will recognize the error of this allocation of resources,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1070, and return to our older and better practice of restraint.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia takes issue with my approach, suggesting that the federal interests vindicated by our review are equally weighty whether the state court found for the defendant or for the State.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x935 (concurring opinion).  In so doing, he overlooks the separate federal interest in ensuring that no person be convicted or sentenced in violation of the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94an interest entirely absent when the State is the petitioner.  It is appropriate\xe2\x80\x94and certainly impartial, but see <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x94to take this difference in federal interests into account in considering whether to grant a petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia also fails to explain why there is such an urgent need \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure the integrity and uniformity of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  If this perceived need is a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary basis for the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s allowing us to be accorded jurisdiction to review state-court decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (citing Art. III, \xc2\xa72, cls. 1 and 2), then one would think that the First Judiciary Act would have given us jurisdiction to review all decisions based on the Federal Constitution coming out of state courts.  But it did not.  Unconcerned about Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy quilt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 4, the First Congress only provided us with jurisdiction over such cases \xe2\x80\x9cwhere [there] is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any State, on the ground of their being repugnant to the constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, <em>and the decision is in favour of such their validity</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \xc2\xa725, 1 Stat. 85 (emphasis added).   Not until 1914 did we have jurisdiction over decisions from state courts which arguably overprotected federal constitutional rights at the expense of state laws.  Act of Dec. 23, 1914, ch. 2, 38 Stat. 790; see also <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Van Arsdall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/index.html">475 U. S. 673</a>, 694\xe2\x80\x93697 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Even then, our review was only by writ of certiorari, whereas until 1988 defendants had a right to <em>appeal</em> to us in cases in which state courts had upheld the validity of state statutes challenged on federal constitutional grounds.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 (1982 ed.).  In other words, during the entire period between 1789 and 1988, the laws enacted by Congress placed greater weight on the vindication of federal rights than on the interest in the uniformity of federal law.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962114">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nKANSAS V.

Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) (1995).  The Supreme Court of Kansas has read this provision to require imposition of the death penalty \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the event of equipoise, [that is,] the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the balance of any aggravating circumstances and any mitigating circumstances weighed equal.\xe2\x80\x9d  278 Kan. 520, 534, 102 P.\xc2\xa03d 445, 457 (2004) (case below); see also <em>State</em> v. <em>Kleypas,</em> 272 Kan. 894, 1016, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 139, 232 (2001) (stating that the language of \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) \xe2\x80\x9cprovides that in doubtful cases the jury must return a sentence of death\xe2\x80\x9d).

See <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html">408 U.

The Constitution was held to require, instead, a system structured to produce reliable, <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html">428 U.

(sanctioning sentencing procedures that \xe2\x80\x9cfocus the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Eighth Amendment, that is, demands both form and substance, both a system for decision and one geared to produce morally justifiable results.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State thinks its scheme is beyond questioning, whether as to form or substance, for it sees the tie-breaker law as equivalent to the provisions examined in <em>Blystone</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/299/index.html">494 U. S. 299</a> (1990), and <em>Boyde</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/370/index.html">494 U. S. 370</a> (1990), where we approved statutes that required a death sentence upon a jury finding that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating ones.  But the crucial fact in those systems was the predominance of the aggravators, and our recognition of the moral rationality of a mandatory capital sentence based on that finding is no authority for giving States free rein to select a different conclusion that will dictate death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the constitutional demand for a reasoned moral response requires the state statute to satisfy two criteria that speak to the issue before us now, one governing the character of sentencing evidence, and one going to the substantive justification needed for a death sentence. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first, there is an obligation in each case to inform the jury\xe2\x80\x99s choice of sentence with evidence about the crime as actually committed and about the specific individual who committed it.  See <em>Spaziano</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/447/index.html">468 U. S. 447</a>, 460, and n. 7 (1984).  Since the sentencing choice is, by definition, the attribution of particular culpability to a criminal act and defendant, as distinct from the general culpability necessarily implicated by committing a given offense, see <em>Penry,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 327\xe2\x80\x93328; <em>Spaziano,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 460; <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U. S. 862</a>, 879 (1983), the sentencing decision must turn on the uniqueness of the individual defendant and on the details of the crime, to which any resulting choice of death must be \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly\xe2\x80\x9d related.  <em>Penry, supra,</em> at 319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, there is the point to which the particulars of crime and criminal are relevant: within the category of capital crimes, the death penalty must be reserved for \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst of the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 568 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cCapital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit \xe2\x80\x98a narrow category of the most serious crimes\xe2\x80\x99 and whose extreme culpability makes them \xe2\x80\x98the most deserving of execution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, 319 (2002))).  One object of the structured sentencing proceeding required in the aftermath of <em>Furman</em> is to eliminate the risk that a death sentence will be imposed in spite of facts calling for a lesser penalty, <em>Penry, supra</em>, at 328\xe2\x80\x93329, and the essence of the sentencing authority\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility is to determine whether the response to the crime and defendant \xe2\x80\x9cmust be death,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spaziano, supra</em>, at 461; cf. <em>Gregg, supra, </em>at 184 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  Of course, in the moral world of those who reject capital punishment in principle, a death sentence can never be a moral imperative.  The point, however, is that within our legal and moral system, which allows a place for the death penalty, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be death\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean \xe2\x80\x9cmay be death.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since a valid capital sentence thus requires a choice based upon unique particulars identifying the crime and its perpetrator as heinous to the point of demanding death even within the class of potentially capital offenses, the State\xe2\x80\x99s provision for a tie breaker in favor of death fails on both counts.  The dispositive fact under the tie breaker is not the details of the crime or the unique identity of the individual defendant.  The determining fact is not directly linked to a particular crime or particular criminal at all; the law operates merely on a jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of equipoise in the State\xe2\x80\x99s own selected considerations for and against death.  Nor does the tie breaker identify the worst of the worst, or even purport to reflect any evidentiary showing that death must be the reasoned moral response; it does the opposite.  The statute produces a death sentence exactly when a sentencing impasse demonstrates as a matter of law that the jury does not see the evidence as showing the worst sort of crime committed by the worst sort of criminal, in a combination heinous enough to demand death.  It operates, that is, when a jury has applied the State\xe2\x80\x99s chosen standards of culpability and mitigation and reached nothing more than what the Supreme Court of Kansas calls a \xe2\x80\x9ctie,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kleypas,</em> 272 Kan., at 1016, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 232 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It mandates death in what that court identifies as \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  The statute thus addresses the risk of a morally unjustifiable death sentence, not by minimizing it as precedent unmistakably requires, but by guaranteeing that in equipoise cases the risk will be realized, by \xe2\x80\x9cplacing a \xe2\x80\x98thumb [on] death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sochor</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/527/index.html">504 U. S. 527</a>, 532 (1992) (quoting <em>Stringer</em> v. <em>Black,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/index.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, 232 (1992); alteration in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Kansas, when a jury applies the State\xe2\x80\x99s own standards of relative culpability and cannot decide that a defendant is among the most culpable, the state law says that equivocal evidence is good enough and the defendant must die.  A law that requires execution when the case for aggravation has failed to convince the sentencing jury is morally absurd, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Constitution tolerates this moral irrationality defies decades of precedent aimed at eliminating freakish capital sentencing in the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That precedent, demanding reasoned moral judgment, developed in response to facts that could not be ignored, the kaleidoscope of life and death verdicts that made no sense in fact or morality in the random sentencing before <em>Furman</em> was decided in 1972.  See 408 U. S.<em>,</em> at 309\xe2\x80\x93310 (Stewart, J., concurring).  Today, a new body of fact must be accounted for in deciding what, in practical terms, the Eighth Amendment guarantees should tolerate, for the period starting in 1989 has seen repeated exonerations of convicts under death sentences, in numbers never imagined before the development of DNA tests.  We cannot face up to these facts and still hold that the guarantee of morally justifiable sentencing is hollow enough to allow maximizing death sentences, by requiring them when juries fail to find the worst degree of culpability: when, by a State\xe2\x80\x99s own standards and a State\xe2\x80\x99s own characterization, the case for death is \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few numbers from a growing literature will give a sense of the reality that must be addressed.  When the Governor of Illinois imposed a moratorium on executions in 2000, 13 prisoners under death sentences had been released since 1977 after a number of them were shown to be innocent, as described in a report which used their examples to illustrate a theme common to all 13, of \xe2\x80\x9crelatively little solid evidence connecting the charged defendants to the crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  State of Illinois, G. Ryan, Governor, Report of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Commission on Capital Punishment: Recommendations Only 7 (Apr. 2002) (hereinafter Report); see also <em>id.,</em> at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 7\xe2\x80\x939.  During the same period, 12 condemned convicts had been executed.  Subsequently the Governor determined that 4 more death row inmates were innocent.  See <em>id.,</em> at 5\xe2\x80\x936; Warden, Illinois Death Penalty Reform, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 381, 382, and n. 6 (2005).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Illinois had thus wrongly convicted and condemned even more capital defendants than it had executed, but it may well not have been otherwise unique; one recent study reports that between 1989 and 2003, 74 American prisoners condemned to death were exonerated, Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, &amp; Patil, Exonerations in the United States 1989 Through 2003, 95 J.

L. &amp; C. 523, 531 (2006) (hereinafter Gross), many of them cleared by DNA evidence, <em>ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</em>  Another report states that \xe2\x80\x9cmore than 110\xe2\x80\x9d death row prisoners have been released since 1973 upon findings that they were innocent of the crimes charged, and \xe2\x80\x9c[h]undreds of additional wrongful convictions in potentially capital cases have been documented over the past century.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lanier &amp; Acker, Capital Punishment, the Moratorium Movement, and Empirical Questions, 10 Psychology, Public Policy &amp; Law 577, 593 (2004).  Most of these wrongful convictions and sentences resulted from eyewitness misidentification, false confession, and (most frequently) perjury, Gross 544, 551\xe2\x80\x93552, and the total shows that among all prosecutions homicide cases suffer an unusually high incidence of false conviction, <em>id.,</em> at 532, 552, probably owing to the combined difficulty of investigating without help from the victim, intense pressure to get convictions in homicide cases, and the corresponding incentive for the guilty to frame the innocent, <em>id.,</em> at 532.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are thus in a period of new empirical argument about how \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is different,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gregg,</em> 428 U. S., at 188 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.): not only would these false verdicts defy correction after the fatal moment, the Illinois experience shows them to be remarkable in number, and they are probably disproportionately high in capital cases.  While it is far too soon for any generalization about the soundness of capital sentencing across the country, the cautionary lesson of recent experience addresses the tie-breaking potential of the Kansas statute: the same risks of falsity that infect proof of guilt raise questions about sentences, when the circumstances of the crime are aggravating factors and bear on predictions of future dangerousness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of evidence of the hazards of capital prosecution, maintaining a sentencing system mandating death when the sentencer finds the evidence pro and con to be in equipoise is obtuse by any moral or social measure.  And unless application of the Eighth Amendment no longer calls for reasoned moral judgment in substance as well as form, the Kansas law is unconstitutional.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority views <em>Walton</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/639/index.html">497 U.

But <em>Walton</em> is ambiguous on this point; while the Court there approved Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s practice of placing the burden on capital defendants to prove, \xe2\x80\x9cby a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 649 (plurality opinion), it did not quantify the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Justice Blackmun clearly thought otherwise, see <em>id.,</em> at 687 (dissenting opinion), but he cried a greater foul than one can get from the majority opinion.  <em>Stare decisis</em> does not control this case.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Illinois Report emphasizes the difference between exoneration of a convict because of actual innocence, and reversal of a judgment because of legal error affecting conviction or sentence but not inconsistent with guilt in fact.  See Report 9 (noting that, apart from the 13 released men, a \xe2\x80\x9cbroader review\xe2\x80\x9d discloses that more than half of the State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty cases \xe2\x80\x9cwere reversed at some point in the process\xe2\x80\x9d).  More importantly, it takes only a cursory reading of the Report to recognize that it describes men released who were demonstrably innocent or convicted on grossly unreliable evidence.  Of one, the Report notes \xe2\x80\x9ctwo other persons were subsequently convicted in Wisconsin of\xe2\x80\x9d the murders.  <em>Id.,</em> at 8.  Of two others, the Report states that they were released after \xe2\x80\x9cDNA tests revealed that none of them were the source of the semen found in the victim.  That same year, two other men confessed to the crime, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life in prison, and a third was tried and convicted for the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of yet another, the Report says that \xe2\x80\x9canother man subsequently confessed to the crime for which [the released man] was convicted.  He entered a plea of guilty and is currently serving a prison term for that crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A number were subject to judgments as close to innocence as any judgments courts normally render.  In the case of one of the released men, the Supreme Court of Illinois found the evidence insufficient to support his conviction.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> 185 Ill. 2d 532, 708 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 365 (1999).  Several others obtained acquittals, and still more simply had the charges against them dropped, after receiving orders for new trials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least 2 of the 13 were released at the initiative of the executive.  We can reasonably assume that a State under no obligation to do so would not release into the public a person against whom it had a valid conviction and sentence unless it were certain beyond all doubt that the person in custody was not the perpetrator of the crime.  The reason that the State would forgo even a judicial forum in which defendants would demonstrate grounds for vacating their convictions is a matter of common sense: evidence going to innocence was conclusive.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left"> The authors state the criteria for their study: \xe2\x80\x9cAs we use the term, \xe2\x80\x98exoneration\xe2\x80\x99 is an official act declaring a defendant not guilty of a crime for which he or she had previously been convicted.  The exonerations we have studied occurred in four ways: (1) In forty-two cases governors (or other appropriate executive officers) issued pardons based on evidence of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 innocence.  (2) In 263 cases criminal charges were dismissed by courts after new evidence of innocence emerged, such as DNA.  (3) In thirty-one cases the defendants were acquitted at a retrial on the basis of evidence that they had no role in the crimes for which they were originally convicted.  (4) In four cases, states posthumously acknowledged the innocence of defendants who had already died in prison . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  Gross 524 (footnote omitted).  The authors exclude from their list of exonerations \xe2\x80\x9cany case in which a dismissal or an acquittal appears to have been based on a decision that while the defendant was not guilty of the charges in the original conviction, he did play a role in the crime and may be guilty of some lesser crime that is based on the same conduct.  For our purposes, a defendant who is acquitted of murder on retrial, but convicted of involuntary manslaughter, has not been exonerated.  We have also excluded any case in which a dismissal was entered in the absence of strong evidence of factual innocence, or in which\xe2\x80\x94despite such evidence\xe2\x80\x94there was unexplained physical evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
