Lodge and De Forest Paine as attorneys of record of the plaintiffs in error, and by the attorney of record of the defendant of error; the entry in this Court of an order of dismissal, under Rule 28, pursuant to the stipulation, and the remittitur from this Court to the Supreme Court of Michigan, "where the order of dismissal was also entered and the decree of the Supreme Court affirmed."

Immediately after receiving notice from said Colton and Roberts that they would do nothing further in said matter, your petitioner proceeded to prepare this petition, and he submits that said stipulation was entered into without authority and is void, and the order entered upon it is void, and that neither said complainants Colton and Roberts nor their attorneys. counselors or solicitors had any right to file said stipulation or to dismiss said cause.  Your petitioner submits that while said stipulation and order of dismissal are void under the circumstances of this case, yet they are not void upon their face, and are apparently a bar to the complainant\'s right of action, and might be used to wrong and injure your petitioner in the suit he is about to institute for the purpose of reviving said cause and having his rights, acquired under said assignment, adjudicated.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This writ of error was docketed here October 12, 1885.  On the eighth of June, 1887, the parties of record entered into the following stipulation:</p>\n<p>"It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties to this cause by their respective attorneys that the writ of error and appeal herein be dismissed and the said cause discontinued without costs to either party; that each party pay his own costs in this court and in the courts below; that the bond for damages executed by plaintiffs in error and sureties be cancelled and the liability of the obligors discharged."</p>\n<p>"An order shall be entered with the clerk accordingly."</p>\n<p>Our Rule 28 is as follows:</p>\n<p>"Whenever the plaintiff and defendant in a writ of error </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 124 U. S. 164</a></p><p> pending in this Court, or the appellant and appellee in an appeal, shall in vacation, by their attorneys of record, sign and file with the clerk an agreement in writing directing the case to be dismissed, and specifying the terms on which it is to be dismissed as to costs, and shall pay to the clerk any fees that may be due to him, it shall be the duty of the clerk to enter the case \'Dismissed,\' and to give to either party requesting it a copy of the agreement filed; but no mandate or other process shall issue without an order of the court."</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this rule, the stipulation of the parties was presented to the clerk of this Court on the eighth of June, 1887, in vacation, and he entered the case "Dismissed."  No mandate or other process has as yet been ordered by the court.</p>\n<p>Albert M. Henry claims to have purchased from Charles B. Colton and Lester A. Roberts, two of the plaintiffs in error, their respective interests in the land which is the subject matter of the controversy in the suit, on the sixteenth of May, 1887, before the stipulation was signed.  He now comes here and by petition asks</p>\n<p>"that an order be entered in this Court setting aside and vacating said order of discontinuance so that your petitioner may have said cause revived as to himself as the grantee and assignee of said complainants, Colton and Roberts,"</p>\n<p>on the ground that the stipulation was signed after his purchase and without authority from him.</p>\n<p>Upon consideration of this petition, it is</p>\n<p><em>Ordered that the entry of dismissal made in vacation be amended by adding thereto these words:  "without prejudice to the right of Albert M. Henry to proceed as he may be advised in the court below for the protection of his interest."</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
