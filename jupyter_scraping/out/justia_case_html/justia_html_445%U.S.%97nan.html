S. 99</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In a state court action, respondent Midcal Aluminum, Inc., a wine distributor, presented a successful antitrust challenge to California\'s resale price maintenance and price posting statutes for the wholesale wine trade.  The issue in this case is whether those state laws are shielded from the Sherman Act by either the "state action" doctrine of <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943), or \xc2\xa7 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Under \xc2\xa7 24866(b) of the California Business and Professions Code, all wine producers, wholesalers, and rectifiers must file fair trade contracts or price schedules with the State. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  If a wine producer has not set prices through a fair trade contract, wholesalers must post a resale price schedule for that producer\'s brands.  \xc2\xa7 24866(a).  No state-licensed wine merchant may sell wine to a retailer at other than the price set "either in an effective price schedule or in an effective fair trade contract. . . ."  \xc2\xa7 24862 (West Supp. 1980).</p>\n<p>The State is divided into three trading areas for administration of the wine pricing program.  A single fair trade contract or schedule for each brand sets the terms for all wholesale transactions in that brand within a given trading area.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 24862, 24864, 24865 (West Supp. 1980).  Similarly, state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 445 U. S. 100</a></p><p> regulations provide that the wine prices posted by a single wholesaler within a trading area bind all wholesalers in that area.  <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc. v. Rice,</em> 90 Cal.App.3d 979, 983-984, 153 Cal.Rptr. 757, 760 (1979).  A licensee selling below the established prices faces fines, license suspension, or outright license revocation.  Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 24880 (West Supp. 1980). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The State has no direct control over wine prices, and it does not review the reasonableness of the prices set by wine dealers.</p>\n<p>Midcal Aluminum, Inc., is a wholesale distributor of wine in southern California.  In July, 1978, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control charged Midcal with selling 27 cases of wine for less than the prices set by the effective price schedule of the E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery.  The Department also alleged that Midcal sold wines for which no fair trade contract or schedule had been filed.  Midcal stipulated that the allegations were true and that the State could fine it or suspend its license for those transgressions.  App. 19-20.  Midcal then filed a writ of mandate in the California Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District asking for an injunction against the State\'s wine pricing system.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal ruled that the wine pricing scheme restrains trade in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1 <em>et seq.</em>  The court relied entirely on the reasoning in <em>Rice v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd.,</em> 21 Cal.3d 431, 579 P.2d 476 (1978), where the California Supreme Court struck down parallel restrictions on the sale of distilled liquors.  In that case, the court held that, because the State played only a passive part in liquor pricing, there was no <em>Parker v. Brown</em> immunity for the program.</p>\n<p>"In the price maintenance program before us, the state plays no role whatever in setting the retail prices.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 445 U. S. 101</a></p><p> prices are established by the producers according to their own economic interests, without regard to any actual or potential anticompetitive effect; the state\'s role is restricted to enforcing the prices specified by the producers.  There is no control, or \'pointed reexamination,\' by the state to insure that the policies of the Sherman Act are not \'unnecessarily subordinated\' to state policy."</p>\n<p>21 Cal.3d at 445, 579 P.2d at 486.</p>\n<p><em>Rice</em> also rejected the claim that California\'s liquor pricing policies were protected by \xc2\xa7 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, which insulates state regulation of intoxicating liquors from many federal restrictions.  The court determined that the national policy in favor of competition should prevail over the state interests in liquor price maintenance -- the promotion of temperance and the preservation of small retail establishments.  The court emphasized that the California system not only permitted vertical control of prices by producers, but also frequently resulted in horizontal price fixing.  Under the program, many comparable brands of liquor were marketed at identical prices. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Referring to congressional and state legislative studies, the court observed that resale price maintenance has little positive impact on either temperance or small retail stores.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#112">445 U. S. 112</a></span>-113.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the State Court of Appeal found the analysis in <em>Rice</em> squarely controlling.  90 Cal.App.3d at 984, 153 Cal.Rptr. at 760.  The court ordered the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control not to enforce the resale price maintenance and price posting statutes for the wine trade.  The Department, which in <em>Rice</em> had not sought certiorari from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 445 U. S. 102</a></p><p> this Court, did not appeal the ruling in this case. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  An appeal was brought by the California Retail Liquor Dealers Association, an intervenor. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The California Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and the Dealers Association sought certiorari from this Court.  We granted the writ, 444 U.S. 824 (1979), and now affirm the decision of the state court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The threshold question is whether California\'s plan for wine pricing violates the Sherman Act.  This Court has ruled consistently that resale price maintenance illegally restrains trade.  In <em>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/373/case.html">220 U. S. 373</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/373/case.html#407">220 U. S. 407</a></span> (1911), the Court observed that such arrangements are "designed to maintain prices . . . and to prevent competition among those who trade in [competing goods]."  <em>See Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html">390 U. S. 145</a></span> (1968); <em>United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/29/case.html">362 U. S. 29</a></span> (1960); <em>United States v. A. Schrader\'s Son, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/85/case.html">252 U. S. 85</a></span> (1920).  For many years, however, the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 permitted the States to authorize resale price maintenance.  50 Stat. 693.  The goal of that statute was to allow the States to protect small retail establishments that Congress thought might otherwise be driven from the marketplace by large-volume discounters.  But in 1975 that congressional permission was rescinded.  The Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801, repealed the Miller-Tydings Act and related legislation. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Consequently, the Sherman Act\'s ban on resale price </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 445 U. S. 103</a></p><p> maintenance now applies to fair trade contracts unless an industry or program enjoys a special antitrust immunity.</p>\n<p>California\'s system for wine pricing plainly constitutes resale price maintenance in violation of the Sherman Act.  <em>Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html">341 U. S. 384</a></span> (1951); <em>see Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra; Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html">340 U. S. 211</a></span> (1951); <em>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co., supra.</em>  The wine producer holds the power to prevent price competition by dictating the prices charged by wholesalers.  As Mr. Justice Hughes pointed out in <em>Dr. Miles,</em> such vertical control destroys horizontal competition as effectively as if wholesalers "formed a combination and endeavored to establish the same restrictions . . . by agreement with each other."  220 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/373/case.html#408">220 U. S. 408</a></span>. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Moreover, there can be no claim that the California program is simply intrastate regulation beyond the reach of the Sherman Act.  <em>See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., supra; Burke v. Ford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/320/case.html">389 U. S. 320</a></span> (1967) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Thus, we must consider whether the State\'s involvement in the price-setting program is sufficient to establish antitrust immunity under <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).  That immunity for state regulatory programs is grounded in our federal structure.</p>\n<p>"In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 445 U.

S. 351</a></span>.  In <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> this Court found in the Sherman Act no purpose to nullify state powers.  Because the Act is directed against "individual, and not state, action," the Court concluded that state regulatory programs could not violate it.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#352">317 U. S. 352</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Under the program challenged in <em>Parker,</em> the State Agricultural Prorate Advisory Commission authorized the organization of local cooperatives to develop marketing policies for the raisin crop.  The Court emphasized that the Advisory Commission, which was appointed by the Governor, had to approve cooperative policies following public hearings:</p>\n<p>"It is the state which has created the machinery for establishing the prorate program. . . .  [I]t is the state, acting through the Commission, which adopts the program and enforces it. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In view of this extensive official oversight, the Court wrote, the Sherman Act did not apply.  Without such oversight, the result could have been different.  The Court expressly noted that</p>\n<p>"a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#351">317 U.

Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U. S. 773</a></span> (1975), the Court concluded that fee schedules enforced by a state bar association were not mandated by ethical standards established by the State Supreme Court.  The fee schedules therefore were not immune from antitrust attack.</p>\n<p>"It is not enough that . . . anticompetitive conduct is \'prompted\' by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#791">421 U.

S. 579</a></span> (1976), a majority of the Court found that no antitrust immunity was conferred when a state agency passively accepted a public utility\'s tariff.  In contrast, Arizona rules against lawyer advertising were held immune from Sherman Act challenge because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 445 U.

S. 103</a></span>.  In view of the State\'s active role, the Court held, the program was not subject to the Sherman Act.  The "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed" goal of the state policy was to "displace unfettered business freedom in the matter of the establishment and relocation of automobile dealerships."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html#109">439 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The California system for wine pricing satisfies the first standard.

Therefore, we turn to that opinion\'s treatment of the state interests in resale price maintenance for distilled liquors.</p>\n<p>In <em>Rice,</em> the State Supreme Court found two purposes behind liquor resale price maintenance -- "to promote temperance and orderly market conditions."  21 Cal.3d at 451, 579 P.2d at 490. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The court found little correlation between resale price maintenance and temperance.  It cited a state study showing a 42 increase in per capita liquor consumption in California from 1950 to 1972, while resale price maintenance was in effect.  <em>Id.</em> at 457-458, 579 P.2d at 494, citing California Dept. of Finance, Alcohol and the State:  A Reappraisal of California\'s Alcohol Control Policies, xi, 15 (1974).  Such studies, the court wrote, "at the very least raise a doubt regarding the justification for such laws on the ground that they promote temperance."  21 Cal.3d at 4575, 579 P.2d at 494. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The <em>Rice</em> opinion identified the primary state interest in orderly market conditions as "protect[ing] small licensees from predatory pricing policies of large retailers."  <em>Id.</em> at 456, 579 P.2d at 493. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In gauging this interest, the court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 445 U. S. 113</a></p><p> adopted the views of the Appeals Board of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Department, which first ruled on the claim in <em>Rice.</em>  The state agency "rejected the argument that fair trade laws were necessary to the economic survival of small retailers. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The agency relied on a congressional study of the impact on small retailers of fair trade laws enacted under the Miller-Tydings Act.  The study revealed that "states with fair trade laws had a 55 percent higher rate of firm failures than free trade states, and the rate of growth of small retail stores in free trade states between 1956 and 1972 was 32 per cent higher than in states with fair trade laws."  <em>Ibid.,</em> citing S.Rep. No. 94-466, p. 3 (1975).  Pointing to the congressional abandonment of fair trade in the 1975 Consumer Goods Pricing Act, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#102">445 U. S. 102</a></span>, the State Supreme Court found no persuasive justification to continue "fair trade laws which eliminate price competition among retailers."  21 Cal.3d at 457, 579 P.2d at 494.  The Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion with respect to the wholesale wine trade.  90 Cal.App.3d at 983, 153 Cal.Rptr. at 760.</p>\n<p>We have no basis for disagreeing with the view of the California courts that the asserted state interests are less substantial than the national policy in favor of competition.  That evaluation of the resale price maintenance system for wine is reasonable, and is supported by the evidence cited by the State Supreme Court in <em>Rice.</em>  Nothing in the record in this case suggests that the wine pricing system helps sustain small retail establishments.  Neither the petitioner nor the State Attorney General in his <em>amicus</em> brief has demonstrated that the program inhibits the consumption of alcohol by Californians.  We need not consider whether the legitimate state interests in temperance and the protection of small retailers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 445 U.

The unsubstantiated state concerns put forward in this case simply are not of the same stature as the goals of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the California Court of Appeal correctly decided that the Twenty-first Amendment provides no shelter for the violation of the Sherman Act caused by the State\'s wine pricing program.
