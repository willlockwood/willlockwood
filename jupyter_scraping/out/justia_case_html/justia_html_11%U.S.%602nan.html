That Joseph Williams, the complainant, paid the whole of the money due to the state for the lands entered, and that John Williams, one of the defendants, not having paid anything, sold his share of the lands to the other defendant, Wallen, who had notice that nothing had been paid by John Williams.  Wallen obtained patents, upon this assignment of John Williams, for two tracts of 640 acres each and one for 440.  The latter tract of 440 acres he sold to a purchaser without notice, but he still held the other two tracts.  That the complainant had demanded from Wallen payment of John Williams\' proportion of the money due to the state, which Wallen refused to pay.  The defendant in his answer relied in part on the statute of limitations.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1909829">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Warren v.
