Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising multiple claims.  And\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71407 authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving one or more common questions of fact .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the just and efficient conduct of such actions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71407(a).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n            \n        \n            \n        The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United States and globally.  The JPML established a multidistrict litigation (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that defendant-banks understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors.  Over 60 actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, including a class action filed by petitioners Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher, who raised the single claim that several banks, acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law.  Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss all antitrust claims, including the Gelboim-Zacher complaint\xe2\x80\x99s sole claim.  The District Court thus dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher complaint, denied leave to amend, and dismissed the case in its entirety.  Other cases made part of the LIBOR MDL, however, presented discrete claims which remained before the District Court.  Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under \xc2\xa71291, the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications authorizing the plaintiffs in some of the multiple-claim actions to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the District Court.  On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the order appealed from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.  The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim and Zacher from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their right to appeal under \xc2\xa71291.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qualify under \xc2\xa71291 as an appealable final decision.  Section 1407 refers to individual \xe2\x80\x9cactions\xe2\x80\x9d transferrable to a single district court, not to a monolithic multidistrict \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d created by transfer.

The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint was a final decision.  The District Court completed its adjudication of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint and terminated their action.  Petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings.  Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil action with other LIBOR MDL cases renders the dismissal of their complaint tentative or incomplete.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        To hold, as the banks contend, that no appeal of right accrues until a \xc2\xa71407 consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the 30-day period for taking an appeal.  The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this, where the transferee court in an MDL grants a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s dispositive motion on every claim (or the sole claim) in a transferred case.  The banks are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while leaving those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because they have other pending claims.  But that concern is attended to by Rule 54(b), which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to parties with multiple-claim complaints, thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review of discrete claims.  The District Court did that in this very case.  Rule 54(b), however, is of no avail to Gelboim and Zacher, who asserted only one claim.  See <i>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Mackey</i>,\n\n351 U.\xc2\xa0S. 427\n.  Section 1292(b)\xe2\x80\x94which allows district courts to designate for review certain interlocutory orders\xe2\x80\x94is also inapposite here, for there is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cinterlocutory\xe2\x80\x9d about the dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.

LIBOR is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United States and globally.</p><p>                    In August 2011, the JPML established MDL No. 2262 (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that the banks named as defendants understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation</i>, 802 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1380 (JPML 2011).  Composing the LIBOR MDL, over 60 actions, commenced in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, were coordinated or consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>                    In June 2012, the District Court entertained a motion to dismiss four categories of cases included in the MDL.  The first three categories involved putative class actions, each with a single lead case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action, filed on behalf of purchasers of bonds with LIBOR-linked interest rates; (2) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of over-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments (OTC plaintiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of LIBOR-based instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs). The fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of individual actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation and related entities.  The Gelboim-Zacher complaint asserted a federal antitrust claim under \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act, 15  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71, and that claim only, while the complaints in the other actions asserted a federal antitrust claim in addition to other differently based federal and state claims.</p><p>                    Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 antitrust claims\xe2\x80\x94the sole claim raised in the Gelboim-Zacher complaint.  Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under \xc2\xa71291 because their suit had been \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed in [its] entirety,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a, the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications to the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs authorizing them to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the District Court.</p><p>                    On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the \xe2\x80\x9corde[r] appealed from did not dispose of all claims in the consolidated action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 2a.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications in the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 actions and, \xe2\x80\x9cgiven the reaction of the Second Circuit,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 294, denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request for a Rule 54(b) certification.</p><p>                    We granted review of the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher appeal.  573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  Before this Court, petitioners Gelboim and Zacher contend that the order dismissing their case in its entirety removed them from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their right to appeal under \xc2\xa71291.  Respondent banks urge that consolidated cases proceed as one unit for the duration of the consolidation.  Consequently, they maintain, there is no appeal of right from an order dismissing fewer than all consolidated claims, thus the sole avenue for appeal while the consolidation continues is Rule 54(b).  Agreeing with Gelboim and Zacher, we reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.</p><p>III</p><p>                    Cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities,[<a href="#F3">3</a>] so an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qual-ify under \xc2\xa71291 as an appealable final decision.  Section 1407 refers to individual \xe2\x80\x9cactions\xe2\x80\x9d which may be transferred to a single district court, not to any monolithic multidistrict \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d created by transfer.  See <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,523 U. S. 26,37 (1998) (\xc2\xa71407 does not \xe2\x80\x9cimbu[e] transferred actions with some new and distinctive . . . character\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  And Congress anticipated that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated pursuant to \xc2\xa71407.  It specified that \xe2\x80\x9cat or before the conclusion of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pretrial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d each of the transferred actions must be remanded to the originating district \xe2\x80\x9c<i>unless [the action] shall have been previously terminated</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71407(a) (emphasis added).</p><p>                    The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint for lack of antitrust injury, without leave to amend, had the hallmarks of a final decision.  Ruling on the merits of the case, the District Court completed its adjudication of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint and terminated their action.  As a result of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, petitioners are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings.  Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil action with other cases in the LIBOR MDL renders the dismissal of their complaint in any way tentative or incomplete.  As is ordinarily the case, the \xc2\xa71407 consolidation offered convenience for the parties and promoted efficient judicial administration, but did not meld the Gelboim-Zacher action and others in the MDL into a single unit.  Cf. <i>supra,</i> at 6, n.\xc2\xa03.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>                    The banks\xe2\x80\x99 view that, in a \xc2\xa71407 consolidation, no appeal of right accrues until the consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary about the proper timing of their appeals.  Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4, which this Court has called \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Russell</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205,209 (2007), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 4(a)(1)(A).  If plaintiffs whose actions have been dismissed with prejudice by a district court must await the termination of pretrial proceedings in all consolidated cases, what event or order would start the 30-day clock?  When pretrial consolidation concludes, there may be no occasion for the entry of any judgment.  Orders may issue returning cases to their originating courts,[<a href="#F6">6</a>] but an order of that genre would not qualify as the dispositive ruling Gelboim and Zacher seek to overturn on appeal.  And surely would-be appellants need not await final disposition of all cases in their originating districts, long after pretrial consolidation under \xc2\xa71407 could even arguably justify treating the cases as a judicial unit.</p><p>                    The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is evident: When the transferee court overseeing pretrial proceedings in multidistrict litigation grants a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s dispositive motion \xe2\x80\x9con all issues in some transferred cases, [those cases] become immediately appealable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. while cases where other issues remain would not be appealable at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d  D. Herr, Multidistrict Litigation Manual \xc2\xa79:21, p. 312 (2014).</p><p>                    The banks express concern that plaintiffs with the weakest cases may be positioned to appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while plaintiffs with stronger cases will be unable to appeal simultaneously because they have other claims still pending.  Brief for Respondents 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  Rule 54(b) attends to this concern.  District courts may grant certifications under that Rule, thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review.  That is just what happened in this very case.  The District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications to the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs so they could appeal at the same time Gelboim and Zacher could.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.  And if the MDL court believes that further proceedings might be relevant to a claim a defendant moves to dismiss, the court ordinarily can defer ruling on the motion, thus allowing all plaintiffs to participate in the ongoing MDL proceedings.</p><p>                    While Rule 54(b) can aid parties with multiple-claim complaints\xe2\x80\x94here, the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs, <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x94the Rule, properly read, is of no avail to Gelboim and Zacher.  Rule 54(b) addresses orders finally adjudicating fewer than all claims presented in a civil action complaint.  It \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply to a single claim action nor to a multiple claims action in which all of the claims have been finally decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mackey</i>, 351 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435; see <i>Liberty Mut.
