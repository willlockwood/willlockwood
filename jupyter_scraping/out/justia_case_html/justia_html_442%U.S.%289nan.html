A three-judge court ruled unconstitutional on various grounds the provisions (1) specifying procedures for the election of employee bargaining representatives; (2) limiting union publicity directed at consumers of agricultural products; (3) imposing a criminal penalty for violations of the statute; (4) excusing an agricultural employer from furnishing a union any materials, information, time, or facilities to enable it to communicate with the employer\'s employees (access provision); and (5) governing arbitration of labor disputes, construed by the court as mandating compulsory arbitration.  Deeming these provisions inseparable from the remainder of the statute, the court went on to declare the whole statute unconstitutional, and enjoined its enforcement.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The challenges to the provisions regulating election procedures, consumer publicity, and criminal sanctions present a case or controversy, but the challenges to the access and arbitration provisions are not justiciable.  Pp. 297-305.</p>\n<p>(a) The fact that appellees have not invoked the election procedures provision in the past or expressed any intention to do so in the future, does not defeat the justiciability of their challenge in view of the nature of their claim that delays attending the statutory election scheme and the technical limitations on who may vote in unit elections severely curtail their freedom of association.  To await appellees\' participation in an election would not assist the resolution of the threshold question whether the election procedures are subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment at all, and, as this question is dispositive of appellees\' challenge, there is no warrant for postponing consideration of the election procedures claim.

Accordingly, the positions of the parties are sufficiently adverse with respect to the consumer publicity provision to present a case or controversy.  For the same reasons, a case or controversy is also presented by appellees\' claim that such provision unduly restricts protected speech by limiting publicity to that directed at agricultural products of an employer with whom a union has a primary dispute.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In this case, we review the decision of a three-judge District Court setting aside as unconstitutional Arizona\'s farm labor statute.  The District Court perceived particular constitutional problems with five provisions of the Act; deeming these provisions inseparable from the remainder of the Act, the court declared the entire Act unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.  We conclude that the challenges to two of the provisions specifically invalidated did not present a case or controversy within the jurisdiction of a federal court, and hence should not have been adjudicated.  Although the attacks on two other provisions were justiciable, we conclude that the District Court should have abstained from deciding the federal issues posed until material, unresolved questions of state law were determined by the Arizona courts.  Finally, we believe that the District Court properly reached the merits of the fifth provision, but erred in invalidating it.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1972, the Arizona Legislature enacted a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of agricultural employment relations.  Arizona Agricultural Employment Relations Act, Ariz Rev.Stat. Ann \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-1381 to 23-1395 (Supp. 1978).  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 442 U. S. 293</a></p><p> statute designates procedures governing the election of employee bargaining representatives, establishes various rights of agricultural employers and employees, proscribes a range of employer and union practices, and establishes a civil and criminal enforcement scheme to ensure compliance with the substantive provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>Appellees -- the United Farm Workers National Union (UFW), an agent of the UFW, named farmworkers, and a supporter of the UFW -- commenced suit in federal court to secure a declaration of the unconstitutionality of various sections of the Act, as well as of the entire Act, and an injunction against its enforcement. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A three-judge District Court was convened to entertain the action.  On the basis of past instances of enforcement of the Act and in light of the provision for imposition of criminal penalties for "violat[ion of] any provision" of the Act, Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 23-1392 (Supp. 1978), the court determined that appellees\' challenges were presently justiciable. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Reaching the merits of some of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 442 U. S. 294</a></p><p> claims, the court ruled unconstitutional five distinct provisions of the Act. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Specifically, the court disapproved the section specifying election procedures, \xc2\xa7 23-138\xef\xbf\xbd, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] on the ground that, by failing to account for seasonal employment peaks, it precluded the consummation of elections before most workers dispersed, and hence frustrated the associational rights of agricultural employees.  The court was also of the view that the Act restricted unduly the class of employees technically eligible to vote for bargaining representatives, and hence burdened the workers\' freedom of association in this second respect. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 442 U. S. 295</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The court; moreover, ruled violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments the provision limiting union publicity directed at consumers of agricultural products, \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8), [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] because, as it construed the section, it proscribed innocent as well as deliberately false representations.  The same section was declared infirm for the additional reason that it prohibited any consumer publicity, whether true or false, implicating a product trade name that "may include" agricultural products of an employer other than the employer with whom the protesting labor organization is engaged in a primary dispute.</p>\n<p>The court also struck down the statute\'s criminal penalty provision,  23-1392, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] on vagueness grounds, and held unconstitutional the provision excusing the employer from furnishing to a labor organization any materials, information, time, or facilities to enable the union to communicate with the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 442 U. S. 296</a></p><p> employer\'s employees.  \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The court thought that the latter provision permitted employers to prevent access by unions to migratory farmworkers residing on their property, in violation of the guarantees of free speech and association.</p>\n<p>Finally, the court disapproved a provision construed as mandating compulsory arbitration, \xc2\xa7 23-1393(b), [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] on the ground that it denied employees due process and the right to a jury trial, which the District Court found guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment.  The remainder of the Act fell "by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 442 U. S. 297</a></p><p> reason of its inseparability and inoperability apart from the provisions found to be invalid."  449 F.Supp. 449, 47 (Ariz.1978).</p>\n<p>Appellants sought review by this Court of the judgment below.  Because of substantial doubts regarding the justiciability of appellees\' claims, we postponed consideration of our jurisdiction to review the merits.  439 U.S. 891 (1978).  We now hold that, of the five provisions specifically invalidated by the District Court, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] only the sections pertaining to election of bargaining representatives, consumer publicity, and imposition of criminal penalties are susceptible of judicial resolution at this time.  We further conclude that the District Court should have abstained from adjudicating appellees\' challenge to the consumer publicity and criminal penalty provisions, although we think the constitutionality of the election procedures was properly considered even lacking a prior construction by the Arizona courts.  We are unable to sustain the District Court\'s declaration, however, that the election procedures are facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We address first the threshold question whether appellees have alleged a case or controversy within the meaning of Art. III of the Constitution or only abstract questions not currently justiciable by a federal court.  The difference between an abstract question and a "case or controversy" is one of degree, of course, and is not discernible by any precise test.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 442 U.

Harris, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#42">401 U. S. 42</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Examining the claims adjudicated by the three-judge court against the foregoing principles, it is our view that the challenges to the provisions regulating election procedures, consumer publicity, and criminal sanctions -- but only those challenges -- present a case or controversy. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As already noted, appellees\' principal complaint about the statutory election procedures is that they entail inescapable delays, and so preclude conducting an election promptly enough to permit participation by many farmworkers engaged in the production of crops having short seasons.  Appellees also assail the assertedly austere limitations on who is eligible to participate in elections under the Act.  Appellees admittedly have not invoked the Act\'s election procedures in the past, nor have they expressed any intention of doing so in the future.  But, as we see it, appellees\' reluctance in this respect does not defeat the justiciability of their challenge in view of the nature of their claim.</p>\n<p>Appellees insist that agricultural workers are constitutionally entitled to select representatives to bargain with their employers over employment conditions.  As appellees read the statute, only representatives duly elected under its provisions may compel an employer to bargain with them.  But </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 442 U. S. 300</a></p><p> appellees maintain, and have adduced evidence tending to prove, that the statutory election procedures frustrate, rather than facilitate, democratic selection of bargaining representatives.  And the UFW has declined to pursue those procedures not for lack of interest in representing Arizona farmworkers in negotiations with employers, but due to the procedures\' asserted futility.  Indeed, the UFW has in the past sought to represent Arizona farmworkers, and has asserted in its complaint a desire to organize such workers and to represent them in collective bargaining.  Moreover, the UFW has participated in nearly 400 elections in California under procedures thought to be amenable to prompt and fair elections.  The lack of a comparable opportunity in Arizona is said to impose a continuing burden on appellees\' associational rights.  Even though a challenged statute is sure to work the injury alleged, however, adjudication might be postponed until "a better factual record might be available."  <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#143">419 U. S. 143</a></span>.  Thus, appellants urge that we should decline to entertain appellees\' challenge until they undertake to invoke the Act\'s election procedures.  In that way, the Court might acquire information regarding how the challenged procedures actually operate, in lieu of the predictive evidence that appellees introduced at trial. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 442 U. S. 301</a></p><p> are persuaded, however, that awaiting appellees\' participation in an election would not assist our resolution of the threshold question whether the election procedures are subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment at all.  As we regard that question dispositive to appellees\' challenge -- as elaborated below -- we think there is no warrant for postponing adjudication of the election claim.</p>\n<p>Appellees\' twofold attack on the Act\'s limitation on consumer publicity is also justiciable now.  Section 21385(b)(8) makes it an unfair labor practice</p>\n<p>"[t]o induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of any agricultural product to refrain from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity."</p>\n<p>And violations of that section may be criminally punishable.  \xc2\xa7 23-1392.  Appellees maintain that the consumer publicity provision unconstitutionally penalizes inaccuracies inadvertently uttered in the course of consumer appeals.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the UFW has actively engaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past in Arizona, and appellees have alleged in their complaint an intention to continue to engage in boycott activities in that State.  Although appellees do not plan to propagate untruths, they contend -- as we have observed -- that "erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate."  <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#271">376 U. S. 271</a></span> (1964).  They submit that, to avoid criminal prosecution, they must curtail their consumer appeals, and thus forgo full exercise of what they insist are their First Amendment rights.  It is urged, accordingly, that their challenge to the limitation on consumer publicity plainly poses an actual case or controversy. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 442 U. S. 302</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellants maintain that the criminal penalty provision has not yet been applied, and may never be applied to commissions of unfair labor practices, including forbidden consumer publicity.  But, as we have noted, when fear of criminal prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional statute is not imaginary or wholly speculative, a plaintiff need not "first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge [the] statute."  <em>Steffel v. Thompson,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html#459">415 U. S. 459</a></span>.  The consumer publicity provision, on its face, proscribes dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive publicity, and the criminal penalty provision applies in terms to "[a]ny person . . . who violates any provision" of the Act.  Moreover, the State has not disavowed any intention of invoking the criminal penalty provision against unions that commit unfair labor practices.  Appellees are thus not without some reason in fearing prosecution for violation of the ban on specified forms of consumer publicity. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In our view, the positions of the parties are sufficiently adverse with respect to the consumer publicity provision proscribing misrepresentations to present a case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p>Section 23-1385(b)(8) also is said to limit consumer appeals to those directed at products with whom the labor organization involved has a primary dispute; as appellees construe it, it <em>proscribes</em></p>\n<p>"publicity directed against any trademark, trade name or generic name which may include agricultural products of another producer or user of such trademark, trade name or generic name."</p>\n<p>Appellees challenge that limitation as unduly restricting protected speech.  Appellees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 442 U. S. 303</a></p><p> have in the past engaged in appeals now arguably prohibited by the statute, and allege an intention to continue to do the same.  For the reasons that appellees\' challenge to the first aspect of the consumer publicity provision is justiciable, we think their claim directed against the second aspect may now be entertained as well.</p>\n<p>We further conclude that the attack on the criminal penalty provision, itself, is also subject to adjudication at this time.  Section 23-1392 authorizes imposition of criminal sanctions against "[a]ny person . . . who violates any provision" of the Act.  Appellees contend that the penalty provision is unconstitutionally vague in that it does not give notice of what conduct is made criminal.  Appellees aver that they have previously engaged, and will in the future engage, in organizing, boycotting, picketing, striking, and collective bargaining activities regulated by various provisions of the Act. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  They assert that they cannot be sure whether criminal sanctions may be visited upon them for pursuing any such conduct, much of which is allegedly constitutionally protected.  As we have noted, it is clear that appellees desire to engage at least in consumer publicity campaigns prohibited by the Act; accordingly, we think their challenge to the precision of the criminal penalty provision, itself, was properly entertained by the District Court, and may be raised here on appeal.  If the provision were truly vague, appellees should not be expected to pursue their collective activities at their peril.</p>\n<p>Appellees\' challenge to the access provision, however, is not justiciable.  The provision, \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C), stipulates that</p>\n<p>"[n]o employer shall be required to furnish or make available to a labor organization . . . information, time, or facilities to enable such . . . labor organization . . . to communicate with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 442 U. S. 304</a></p><p> employees of the employer, members of the labor organization, its supporters, or adherents."</p>\n<p>Appellees insist, and the District Court held, that this provision deprives the Arizona Employment Relations Board -- charged with responsibility for enforcing the Act -- of any discretion to compel agricultural employers to furnish materials, information, time, or facilities to labor organizations desirous of communicating with workers located on the employers\' property, and that the section, for this reason, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>It may be accepted that the UFW will inevitably seek access to employers\' property in order to organize or simply to communicate with farmworkers.  But it is conjectural to anticipate that access will be denied.  More importantly, appellees\' claim depends inextricably upon the attributes of the situs involved.  They liken farm labor camps to the company town involved in <em>Marsh v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/501/case.html">326 U. S. 501</a></span> (1946), in which the First Amendment was held to operate.  Yet it is impossible to know whether access will be denied to places fitting appellees\' constitutional claim.  We can only hypothesize that such an event will come to pass, and it is only on this basis that the constitutional claim could be adjudicated at this time.  An opinion now would be patently advisory; the adjudication of appellees\' challenge to the access provision must therefore await at least such time as appellees can assert an interest in seeking access to particular facilities as well as a palpable basis for believing that access will be refused.</p>\n<p>Finally, the constitutionality of the allegedly compulsory arbitration provision was also improperly considered by the District Court.  That provision specifies that an employer may seek and obtain an injunction</p>\n<p>"upon the filing of a verified petition showing that his agricultural employees are unlawfully on strike or are unlawfully conducting a boycott, or are unlawfully threatening to strike or boycott, and that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 442 U. S. 305</a></p><p> resulting cessation of work or conduct of a boycott will result in the prevention of production or the loss, spoilage, deterioration, or reduction in grade, quality or marketability of an agricultural commodity or commodities for human consumption in commercial quantities."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 23-1393(b).  If an employer invokes a court\'s jurisdiction to issue a temporary restraining order to enjoin a strike, the employer "must as a condition thereto agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration as the means of settling the unresolved issues."  And if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the court must appoint one.</p>\n<p>On the record before us, there is an insufficiently real and concrete dispute with respect to application of this provision.  Appellees themselves acknowledge that, assuming an arguably unlawful strike will occur, employers may elect to pursue a range of responses other than seeking an injunction and agreeing to arbitrate.  Moreover, appellees have never contested the constitutionality of the arbitration clause.  They declare that</p>\n<p>"[t]he three-judge court below, on its own motion, found the binding arbitration provision of \xc2\xa7 1393(b) violative of substantive due process and the Seventh Amendment."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellees 71 n. 153.  Appellees, instead, raised other challenges to the statute\'s civil enforcement scheme, which we do not consider on this appeal.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  It is clear, then, that any ruling on the compulsory arbitration provision would be wholly advisory.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that, even assuming any of appellees\' claims are justiciable, the District Court should have abstained from adjudicating those claims until the Arizona courts might authoritatively construe the provisions at issue.  We disagree that appellees\' challenge to the statutory election procedures should first be submitted to the Arizona courts, but we think that the District Court should have abstained from considering the constitutionality of the criminal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 442 U. S. 306</a></p><p> penalty provision and the consumer publicity provision pending review by the state courts.</p>\n<p>As we have observed, "<em>[a]bstention . . . sanctions . . . escape [from immediate decision] only in narrowly limited "special circumstances."\'"  <em>Kusper v.

S. 534</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We think that a state court construction of the provision governing election procedures would not obviate the need for decision of the constitutional issue or materially alter the question to be decided.  As we shall discuss, our resolution of the question whether the statutory election procedures are affected with a First Amendment interest at all is dispositive of appellees\' challenge.  And insofar as it bears on that matter, the statute is pointedly clear.  Accordingly, we perceive no basis for declining to decide appellees\' challenge to the election procedures, notwithstanding the absence of a prior state court adjudication. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 442 U. S. 307</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We conclude, however, that the District Court should have postponed resolution of appellees\' challenge to the criminal penalty provision.  That section provides in pertinent part that "[a]ny person . . . who violates any provision of [the Act] is guilty of a misdemeanor."  \xc2\xa7 23-1392.  Appellees maintain that the penalty provision leaves substantial doubt regarding what activities will elicit criminal sanctions.  The District Court so concluded, observing that</p>\n<p>"[c]onsidering the enormous variety of activities covered by the Act, [the penalty section] is clearly a statutory provision so vague that men of common intelligence can only guess at its meaning."</p>\n<p>449 F.Supp. at 453.  The court elaborated:</p>\n<p>"There is no way for anyone to guess whether criminal provisions will apply to any particular conduct, in advance, and it is clear that the statute is unconstitutionally vague and does not adequately define prohibited conduct and is, therefore, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Appellants, themselves, do not argue that the criminal penalty provision is unambiguous.  Indeed, they insist that, until the provision is enforced, "it is impossible to know what will be considered a <em>violatio[n]\' of the Act."  Brief for Appellants 37.  Appellants submit that various unfair labor practices, for example, have not been treated as yet as criminal violations.\n</em></p>\n<p>It is possible, however, that the penalty provision might be construed broadly as applying to all sections of the Act that affirmatively proscribe or command courses of conduct.  In terms, it reaches "[a]ny person . . .who violates any provision of" the Act.  Alternatively, the Arizona courts might conclude that only limited portions of the Act are susceptible of being "violated," and thus narrowly define the reach of the penalty section.  In either case, it is evident that the statute is reasonably susceptible of constructions that might undercut or modify appellees\' vagueness attack.  It may be that, if construed broadly, the penalty provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 442 U. S. 308</a></p><p> would operate in conjunction with substantive provisions of the Act to restrict unduly the pursuit of First Amendment activities.  But it is at least evident that an authoritative construction of the penalty provision may significantly alter the constitutional questions requiring resolution. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We have noted, of course, that, when</p>\n<p>"extensive adjudications, under the impact of a variety of factual situations, [would be required in order to bring a challenged statute] within the bounds of permissible constitutional certainty,"</p>\n<p>abstention may be inappropriate.  <em>Baggett v. Bullitt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/360/case.html">377 U. S. 360</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/360/case.html#378">377 U. S. 378</a></span> (1964).  But here the Arizona courts may determine in a single proceeding what substantive provisions the penalty provision modifies.  In this case, the "uncertain issue of state law [turns] upon a choice between one or several alternative meanings of [the] state statute."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, we think the Arizona courts should be "afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon" the section under review.  <em>Harrison v. NAACP, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/167/case.html#176">360 U. S. 176</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The District Court should have abstained with respect to appellees\' challenges to the consumer publicity provision as well.  Appellees have argued that Arizona\'s proscription of misrepresentations by labor organizations in the course of appeals to consumers intolerably inhibits the exercise of their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 442 U. S. 309</a></p><p> First Amendment right freely to discuss issues concerning the employment of farm laborers and the production of crops.  Appellants submit, however, that the statutory ban on untruthful consumer publicity might fairly be construed by an Arizona court as proscribing only misrepresentations made with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of truth or falsity.  As that is the qualification that appellees insist the prohibition of misstatements must include, a construction to that effect would substantially affect the constitutional question presented.</p>\n<p>It is reasonably arguable that the consumer publicity provision is susceptible of the construction appellants suggest.  Section 23-1385(b)(8) makes it unlawful</p>\n<p>"[t]o induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of any agricultural product to refrain from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product by use of dishonest, untruthful <em>and</em> deceptive publicity."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  On its face, the statute does not forbid the propagation of untruths without more.  Rather, to be condemnable, consumer publicity must be "dishonest" and "deceptive" as well as untruthful.  And the Arizona courts may well conclude that a "dishonest" and "untruthful" statement is one made with knowledge of falsity or in reckless disregard of falsity. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 442 U. S. 310</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To be sure, the consumer publicity provision further provides that "[p]ermissible inducement or encouragement . . . means truthful, honest <em>and</em> nondeceptive publicity. . . ."  (Emphasis added.)  That phrase may be read to indicate that representations not having all three attributes are prohibited under the Act.  But it could be held that the phrase denotes only that "truthful, honest and nondeceptive publicity" is permissible, not that any other publicity is prohibited.  When read in conjunction with the prohibitory clause preceding it, the latter phrase thus introduces an ambiguity suitable for state court resolution.  In sum, we think adjudication of appellees\' attack on the statutory limitation on untruthful consumer appeals should await an authoritative interpretation of that limitation by the Arizona courts.</p>\n<p>We further conclude that the District Court should have abstained from adjudicating appellees\' additional contention that the consumer publicity provision unconstitutionally precludes publicity not directed at the products of employers with whom the protesting labor organization has a primary dispute.  We think it is by no means clear that the statute in fact <em>prohibits</em> publicity solely because it is directed at the products of particular employers.  As already discussed, \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8) declares it an unfair labor practice to induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of agricultural products to refrain from purchasing products "by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity."  The provision then stipulates:</p>\n<p>"Permissible inducement or encouragement within the meaning of this section means truthful, honest and nondeceptive publicity which identifies the agricultural product </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 442 U. S. 311</a></p><p> produced by an agricultural employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute.  Permissible inducement or encouragement does not include publicity directed against any trademark, trade name or generic name which may include agricultural products of another producer or user of such trademark, trade name or generic name."</p>\n<p>The section nowhere proscribes publicity directed at products of employers with whom a labor organization is not engaged in a primary dispute.  It indicates only that publicity ranging beyond a primary disagreement is not accorded affirmative statutory protection  The Arizona courts might reasonably determine that the language in issue does no more than that, and might thus ameliorate appellees\' concerns. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, \xc2\xa7 23-1385(B)(8) might be construed, in light of \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C), to prohibit only threatening speech.  The latter provision states in pertinent part that</p>\n<p>"[t]he expressing of any views, argument, opinion or the making of any statement . . . or the dissemination of such views whether in written, printed, graphic, visual or auditory form, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 442 U. S. 312</a></p><p> labor practice. . . ."</p>\n<p>On its face, \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C) would appear to qualify \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8), as the latter identifies "an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or it agents."  Were the consumer publicity provision interpreted to intercept only those expressions embodying a threat of force, the issue of its constitutional validity would assume a character wholly different from the question posed by appellees\' construction.</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that the District Court erred in entertaining all aspects of appellees\' challenge to the consumer publicity section without the benefit of a construction thereof by the Arizona courts.  We are sensitive to appellees\' reluctance to repair to the Arizona courts after extensive litigation in the federal arena.  We nevertheless hold that, in this case, the District Court should not have adjudicated substantial constitutional claims with respect to statutory provisions that are patently ambiguous on their face. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The merits of appellees\' challenge to the statutory election procedures remain to be considered.  Appellees contend, and the District Court concluded, that the delays assertedly attending the statutory election scheme and the technical limitations on who may vote in unit elections severely curtail appellees\' freedom of association.  This freedom, it is said, entails the liberty not only to join or sustain a labor union and collectively to express a position to an agricultural employer, but also to create or elect an organization entitled to invoke the statutory provision requiring an employer to bargain collectively with the certified representative of his employees.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 442 U. S. 313</a></p><p> As we see it, however, these general complaints that the statutory election procedures are ineffective are matters for the Arizona Legislature, and not the federal courts.</p>\n<p>Accepting that the Constitution guarantees workers the right individually or collectively to voice their views to their employers, <em>see Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School Dist.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html">439 U. S. 410</a></span> (1979); <em>cf. Madison School Dist. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/167/case.html">429 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/167/case.html#173">429 U. S. 173</a></span>-175 (1976), the Constitution does not afford such employees the right to compel employers to engage in a dialogue, or even to listen.  Accordingly, Arizona was not constitutionally obliged to provide a procedure pursuant to which agricultural employees, through a chosen representative, might compel their employers to negotiate.  That it has undertaken to do so in an assertedly niggardly fashion, then, presents as a general matter no First Amendment problems. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Moreover, the Act does not preclude voluntary recognition of a labor organization by an agricultural employer.  Thus, in the event that an employer desires to bargain with a representative chosen by his employees independently of the statutory election procedures, such bargaining may readily occur.  The statutory procedures need be pursued only if farmworkers desire to designate exclusive bargaining representatives and to compel their employer to bargain -- rights that are conferred by statute, rather than the Federal Constitution.  Accordingly, at this time, we are unable to discern any First Amendment difficulty with the Arizona statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 442 U.

In addition, various constitutional challenges were made to one or more parts of 15 provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court did not analyze section by section why a case or controversy existed with respect to each of the challenged sections.  Rather, from instances of private and official enforcement detailed in a stipulation filed by the parties, the court concluded that the case was not "hypothetical, abstract, or generalized."  449 F.Supp. 449, 452 (Ariz.1978).  It did, however, focus specifically on \xc2\xa7 23-1392.  That provision makes it a crime to violate any other provision of the Act; and although the District Court deemed this section severable from the rest of the Act, it relied heavily on its conclusion that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of this section to justify its considering the constitutionality of other sections of the Act.  <em>See</em> 449 F.Supp. at 454.  In proceeding to do so, it ruled that evidence would be considered only in connection with \xc2\xa7 23-1389, dealing with the election of bargaining representatives and with respect to \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C), limiting union access to employer properties, although evidence was introduced at trial relative to other provisions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The court did not explain the basis for selecting, from all of the challenges presented, the five provisions on which it passed judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 23-1389 declares that representatives selected by a secret ballot for the purpose of collective bargaining by the majority of agricultural employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall be the exclusive representatives of all agricultural employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining.  And it requires the Agricultural Employment Relations Board to ascertain the unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.  The section further provides that the Board shall investigate any petition alleging facts specified in \xc2\xa7 23-1389 indicating that a question of representation exists and schedule an appropriate hearing when the Board has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation does exist.  If the hearing establishes that such a question exists, the Board is directed to order an election by secret ballot, and to certify the results thereof.  Section 23-1389 details the manner in which an election is to be conducted.  The section further provides for procedures by which an employer might challenge a petition for an election.  Additionally, \xc2\xa7 23-1389 stipulates that no election shall be directed or conducted in any unit within which a valid election has been held in the preceding 12 months.</p>\n<p>Section 23-1389 also sets down certain eligibility requirements regarding participation in elections conducted thereunder.  And it imposes obligations on employers to furnish information to the Board, to be made available to interested unions and employees, concerning bargaining unit employees qualified to vote.  Finally, the section specifies procedures whereby agricultural employees may seek to rescind the representation authority of a union currently representing those employees.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The election provision contemplates voting by "agricultural employees," \xc2\xa7 23-1389(A), which is defined in \xc2\xa7 23-1382(1) so as to exclude workers having only a brief history of employment with an agricultural employer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 23-1385(b)(8) makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents:</p>\n<p>"To induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of any agricultural product to refrain from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.  Permissible inducement or encouragement within the meaning of this section means truthful, honest and nondeceptive publicity which identifies the agricultural product produced by an agricultural employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute.

In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within two days after the court awards a restraining order, the court shall appoint one to decide the unresolved issues.  Any agricultural employer shall be entitled to injunctive relief accorded by Rule 65 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure upon the filing of a verified petition showing that his agricultural employees are unlawfully on strike or are unlawfully conducting a boycott, or are unlawfully threatening to strike or boycott, and that the resulting cessation of work or conduct of a boycott will result in the prevention of production or the loss, spoilage, deterioration, or reduction in grade, quality or marketability of an agricultural commodity or commodities for human consumption in commercial quantities.

The court then enjoined enforcement of the Act in its entirety, finding the provisions not explicitly invalidated to be inseparable from those actually adjudicated.  <em>Id.</em> at 467.

We think that the prospect of issuance of an administrative cease-and-desist order, \xc2\xa7 23-1390(C), or a court-ordered injunction, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-1390(E), (J), (K), against such prohibited conduct provides substantial additional support for the conclusion that appellees\' challenge to the publicity provision is justiciable.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>E.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C) (access to employer\'s property), \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(7) (boycotts); \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(12) (picketing and boycotts); \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(13) (striking by minorities); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-1384, 23-1385(D) (collective bargaining).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent suggests that \xc2\xa7 23-1392 is unambiguous, and needs no construction, and that abstention is therefore improper.  But the District Court invalidated \xc2\xa7 23-1392 on vagueness grounds, and the State\'s position with respect to the issue is such that we are reluctant to conclude that appellees\' challenge to \xc2\xa7 23-1392 on vagueness grounds is without substance, and hence that it contains no ambiguity warranting abstention.</p>\n<p>If there were to be no abstention regarding \xc2\xa7 23-1392 on the basis that it clearly criminalizes any departure from the command of any provision of the Act, adequate consideration of whether the section is unconstitutionally overbroad would require inquiry into whether some conduct prohibited by the Act is constitutionally shielded from criminal punishment.  But that would entail dealing with the validity of provisions about which there may be no case or controversy or with respect to which abstention is the proper course.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Although construing the section in this manner would apparently satisfy appellees, we should not be understood as declaring that the section and its criminal sanction would be unconstitutional if they proscribed damaging falsehoods perpetrated unknowingly or without recklessness.  We have not adjudicated the role of the First Amendment in suits by private parties against nonmedia defendants, nor have we considered the constitutional implications of causes of action for injurious falsehoods outside the area of defamation and the ground covered by <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html">385 U. S. 374</a></span> (1967).  <em>Linn v.

We understand appellees\' equal protection challenge to embrace the sections pertaining to access to an employer\'s property and consumer publicity.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  The potential for this self-censorship is abhorrent to the First Amendment.  It should be permitted by a court in equity only for the most important of reasons.  It cannot be tolerated on the basis of the slender ambiguity which the Court has managed to create in this statute.  Abstention on this issue is therefore manifestly unjustified. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Because of the ambiguous relationship between \xc2\xa7 23-1385(C) and \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8), I concur in the Court\'s holding that the District Court should have abstained with respect to \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court also found \xc2\xa7 23-1.392 to be "unconstitutionally vague."  449 F.Supp. at 453.  The Court stated:</p>\n<p>"Considering the enormous variety of activities covered by the Act, and the fact that . . . many of these involve First and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights, it is clearly a statutory provision so vague that men of common intelligence can only guess at its meaning."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"There is no way for anyone to guess whether criminal provisions will apply to any particular conduct, in advance, and it is clear that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, and does not adequately define prohibited conduct and is, therefore, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The fact that \xc2\xa7 23-1392 is, for purposes of the abstention doctrine, "plain and unambiguous," does not necessarily mean that it cannot be unconstitutionally vague for purposes of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The section may plainly and unambiguously create criminal sanctions for violations of sections of the Act which, considered as criminal prohibitions, would be unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if the statute were ambiguous in the manner suggested by the Court, abstention would still be inappropriate.  It is extraordinarily unlikely that, in a statute as complex and far-ranging as this Act, a single adjudication could definitively specify the exact reach of \xc2\xa7 23-1392.  In such circumstances, we have held that a federal court should not abstain from exercising its jurisdiction.  As we stated in <em>Procunier v. Martinez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html">416 U. S. 396</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#401">416 U. S. 401</a></span> n. 5 (1974):</p>\n<p>"Where . . as in this case, the statute or regulation is challenged as vague because individuals to whom it plainly applies simply cannot understand what is required of them, and do not wish to forswear all activity arguably within the scope of the vague terms, abstention is not required.  [<em>Baggett v. Bullitt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/377/360/case.html">377 U. S. 360</a></span>,]  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/377/360/case.html#378">377 U. S. 378</a></span> [1964].  In such a case, no single adjudication by a state court could eliminate the constitutional difficulty.  Rather, it would require \'extensive adjudications, under the impact of a variety of factual situations,\' to bring the challenged statute or regulation \'within the bounds of permissible constitutional certainty.\'  <em>Ibid.</em>"</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1385(b)(8), for example, makes it an unfair labor practice</p>\n<p>"[t]o induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of any agricultural product to refrain from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.  Permissible inducement or encouragement within the meaning of this section means truthful, honest and nondeceptive publicity which identifies the agricultural product produced by an agricultural employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute.  Permissible inducement or encouragement does not include publicity directed against any trademark, trade name or generic name which may include agricultural products of another producer or user of such trademark, trade name or generic name."</p>\n<p>Section 23-1392 makes violation of \xc2\xa7 23-1385(b)(8) a crime.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellees may be deterred from constitutionally protected speech even if the regulations which the Agricultural Employment Relations Act otherwise imposes on their speech are permissible under the First Amendment.  This is because criminal sanctions discourage speech much more powerfully than do administrative regulations.  Such sanctions would thus be more apt to cause employers and employees to "steer far wider of the unlawful zone," <em>Speiser v. Randall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html">357 U. S. 513</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html#526">357 U.

For this reason, it does not follow that, because the First Amendment permits certain speech to be regulated, it must also permit such speech to be punished.  <em>See Gertz v.
