The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that JCG and its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by Janus Investment Fund\xe2\x80\x94for which JCM was the investment adviser and administrator\xe2\x80\x94and that those statements affected the price of JCG\xe2\x80\x99s stock.  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had sufficiently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading statements contained in the documents.  Before this Court, First Derivative continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under \xc2\xa720(a).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.

Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a statement in its own right.  This rule follows from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html">511 U. S. 164</a>, 180, which held that Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial assistance\xe2\x80\x9d to the making of a statement but do not actually make it.  Reading \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly, to include persons or entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substantially undermine <em>Central Bank</em> by rendering aiders and abettors almost nonexistent.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is also suggested by <em>Stoneridge, </em>552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that must be given the implied private right of action, <em>id.,</em> at 167.

Adopting that definition would be inconsistent with <em>Stoneridge, supra</em>, at 161, which rejected a private Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 suit against companies involved in deceptive transactions, even when information about those transactions was later incorporated into false public statements.  First Derivative notes the uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reapportionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly the responsibility of Congress, not the courts.  Furthermore, First Derivative\xe2\x80\x99s rule would read into Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 a theory of liability similar to\xe2\x80\x94but broader than\xe2\x80\x94control-person liability under \xc2\xa720(a).

Its assistance in crafting what was said was subject to Janus Investment Fund\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate control.

Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2010).  We conclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not make the statements in the prospectuses.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded company that created the Janus family of mutual funds.  These mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts business trust, the Janus Investment Fund.  Janus Investment Fund retained JCG\xe2\x80\x99s wholly owned subsidiary, JCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator.  JCG and JCM are the petitioners here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus Investment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors.  Janus Investment Fund has no assets apart from those owned by the investors.  JCM provides Janus Investment Fund with investment advisory services, which include \xe2\x80\x9cthe management and administrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus] Fun[d],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal independence.  At all times relevant to this case, all of\nthe officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of JCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund\xe2\x80\x99s board of trustees was associated with JCM.  This is more independence than is required: By statute, up to 60 percent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of \xe2\x80\x9cinterested persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9310(a); see also 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x932(a)(19) (2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cinterested\nperson\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund issued prospectuses describing the investment strategy and operations of its mutual funds to investors.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a\xe2\x80\x938(b), 80a\xe2\x80\x932(a)(31), 80a\xe2\x80\x9329(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  The prospectuses for several funds represented that the funds were not suitable for market timing and can be read to suggest that JCM would implement policies to curb the practice.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  For example, the Janus Mercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002, stated that the fund was \xe2\x80\x9cnot intended for market timing or excessive trading\xe2\x80\x9d and represented that it \xe2\x80\x9cmay reject any purchase request \xe2\x80\xa6 if it believes that any combination of trading activity is attributable to market timing or is otherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the Fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 141a.  Although market timing is legal, it harms other investors in the mutual fund.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of New York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging that JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit market timing in several funds run by JCM.  After the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations became public, investors withdrew significant amounts of money from the Janus Investment Fund mutual funds.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Because Janus Investment Fund compensated JCM based on the total value of the funds and JCM\xe2\x80\x99s management fees comprised a significant percentage of JCG\xe2\x80\x99s income, Janus Investment Fund\xe2\x80\x99s loss of value affected JCG\xe2\x80\x99s value as well.  JCG\xe2\x80\x99s stock price fell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to $13.50 on September 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative) represents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of September 3, 2003.  Its complaint asserts claims against JCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 and \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b).  First Derivative alleges that JCG and JCM \xe2\x80\x9ccaused mutual fund prospectuses to be issued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to the investing public, which created the misleading impression that [JCG and JCM] would implement measures to curb market timing in the Janus [mutual funds].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a.  \xe2\x80\x9cHad the truth been known, Janus [mutual funds] would have been less attractive to investors, and consequently, [JCG] would have realized lower revenues, so [JCG\xe2\x80\x99s] stock would have traded at lower prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 72a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First Derivative contends that JCG and JCM \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially misled the investing public\xe2\x80\x9d and that class members relied \xe2\x80\x9cupon the integrity of the market price of [JCG] securities and market information relating to [JCG and JCM].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 109a.  The complaint also alleges that JCG should be held liable for the acts of JCM as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling person\xe2\x80\x9d under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.) (\xc2\xa720(a) of the Act).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation</em>, 487 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 618, 620 (D Md. 2007).  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had sufficiently alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cJCG and JCM, by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses, <em>made</em> the misleading statements contained in the documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Mutual Funds Inv.

With respect to the element of reliance, the court found that investors would infer that JCM \xe2\x80\x9cplayed a role in preparing or approving the content of the Janus fund prospectuses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 127, but that investors would not infer the same about JCG, which could be liable only as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol person\xe2\x80\x9d of JCM under \xc2\xa720(a).  <em>Id.</em>, at 128, 129\xe2\x80\x93130.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to address whether JCM can be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 for false statements included in Janus Investment Fund\xe2\x80\x99s pro-spectuses.  561 U.

Although neither Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 nor \xc2\xa710(b) expressly creates a private right of action, this Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9ca private right of action is implied under \xc2\xa710(b).\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Superintendent of Ins. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/6/index.html">404 U.

When \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d is paired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the resulting phrase is \xe2\x80\x9capproximately equivalent in sense\xe2\x80\x9d to that verb.  6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933) (hereinafter OED); accord, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Make</em> followed by a noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equivalent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun\xe2\x80\x9d).  For instance, \xe2\x80\x9cto make a proclamation\xe2\x80\x9d is the approximate equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cto proclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto make a promise\xe2\x80\x9d approximates \xe2\x80\x9cto promise.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 6 OED 66 (def. 59).  The phrase at issue in Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make any \xe2\x80\xa6 statement,\xe2\x80\x9d is thus the approximate equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cto state.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For purposes of Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it.  Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a statement in its own right.  One who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker.  And in the ordinary case, attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement was made by\xe2\x80\x94and only by\xe2\x80\x94the party to whom it is attributed.  This rule might best be exemplified by the relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker.  Even when a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it.  And it is the speaker who takes credit\xe2\x80\x94or blame\xe2\x80\x94for what is ultimately said.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This rule follows from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/164/index.html">511 U. S. 164</a> (1994), in which we held that Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.  See <em>id.</em>, at 180.  Such suits\xe2\x80\x94against entities that contribute \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial assistance\xe2\x80\x9d to the making of a statement but do not actually make it\xe2\x80\x94may be brought by the SEC, see 15 U.

A broader reading of \xe2\x80\x9cmake,\xe2\x80\x9d including persons or entities without ultimate control over the content of a statement, would substantially undermine <em>Central Bank</em>.  If persons or entities without control over the content of a statement could be considered primary violators who \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d the statement, then aiders and abettors would be almost nonexistent.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation is further supported by our recent decision in <em>Stoneridge</em>.  There, investors sued \xe2\x80\x9centities who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors\xe2\x80\x99 company to mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial statement.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U.

Significantly, in reaching that conclusion we emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing [the defendants] did made it necessary or inevitable for [the company] to record the transactions as it did.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 161.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This emphasis suggests the rule we adopt today: that the maker of a statement is the entity with authority over the content of the statement and whether and how to communicate it.

The price for buying or selling shares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset value (NAV) calculation after the order is placed.  The NAV calculation usually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.  Because of certain time delays, however, the values used in these calculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the underlying assets.  For example, a fund may value its foreign securities based on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have occurred several hours before the calculation.  But events might have taken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected to affect their price.  If the event were expected to increase the price of the foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a mutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the NAV corrects itself upward.

And Janus Management, acting through those employees, carries out the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s daily activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 says in relevant part that it is unlawful for \xe2\x80\x9cany person, directly or indirectly \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>[t]o make</em> any untrue statement of a material fact\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935(b) (2010) (emphasis added).  See also 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b) (\xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The specific legal question before us is whether Janus Management can be held responsible under the Rule for having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d certain false statements about the Janus Fund\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  The statements in question appear in the Janus Fund\xe2\x80\x99s prospectuses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus Management, could have \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d those statements.

To the contrary, both language and case law indicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a management company, a board of trustees, individual company officers, or others, separately or together, might \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d statements contained in a firm\xe2\x80\x99s prospectus\xe2\x80\x94even if a board of directors has ultimate content-related responsibility.

S. 148</a>, 157 (2008) (identi-fying the elements of \xe2\x80\x9ca typical \xc2\xa710(b) private action\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority finds the complaint fatally flawed, however, because (1) Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 says that no \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d shall \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly or indirectly \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>make</em> any untrue statement of a material fact,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the statements at issue appeared in the <em>Janus Fund\xe2\x80\x99s </em>prospectuses, and (3) only \xe2\x80\x9cthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a false statement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But where can the majority find legal support for the rule that it enunciates?  The English language does not impose upon the word \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d boundaries of the kind the majority finds determinative.  Every day, hosts of corporate officials make statements with content that more senior officials or the board of directors have \xe2\x80\x9cultimate authority\xe2\x80\x9d to control.  So do cabinet officials make statements about matters that the Constitution places within the ultimate authority of the President.  So do thousands, perhaps millions, of other employees make statements that, as to content, form, or timing, are subject to the control of another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the English language prevents one from saying that several different individuals, separately or together, \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a statement that each has a hand in producing.  For example, as a matter of English, one can say that a national political party has made a statement even if the only written communication consists of uniform press releases issued in the name of local party branches; one can say that one foreign nation has made a statement even when the officials of a different nation (subject to its influence) speak about the matter; and one can say that the President has made a statement even if his press officer issues a communication, sometimes in the press officer\xe2\x80\x99s own name.  Practical matters related to context, including control, participation, and relevant audience, help determine who \xe2\x80\x9cmakes\xe2\x80\x9d a statement and to whom that statement may properly be \xe2\x80\x9cattributed,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x94at least as far as ordinary English is concerned.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither can the majority find support in any relevant precedent. The majority says that its rule \xe2\x80\x9cfollows from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html">511 U. S. 164</a> (1994),\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Court \xe2\x80\x9cheld that Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But <em>Central Bank </em>concerns a different matter.  And it<em> </em>no more requires the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule than free air travel for small children requires free air travel for adults.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Central Bank</em> is a case about <em>secondary</em> liability, liability attaching, not to an individual making a false statement, but to an individual helping <em>someone else</em> do so.  <em>Central Bank</em> involved a bond issuer accused of having made materially false statements, which overstated the values of property that backed the bonds.  <em>Central Bank</em> also involved a defendant that was a bank, serving as indenture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond issuer\xe2\x80\x99s valuations.  The plaintiffs claimed that the bank delayed its valuation checks and thereby <em>helped</em> the issuer make its false statements credible.  The question before the Court concerned the bank\xe2\x80\x99s liability\xe2\x80\x94a <em>secondary</em> liability for \xe2\x80\x9caiding and abetting\xe2\x80\x9d the bond issuer, who (on the theory set forth) was primarily liable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court made this clear.  The question presented was \xe2\x80\x9cwhether private civil liability under \xc2\xa710(b) extends \xe2\x80\xa6 to those <em>who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice</em>, but who aid and abet the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 167 (emphasis added).  The Court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9caiding and abetting liability reaches persons <em>who do not engage in the proscribed activities at all</em>, but who give a degree of aid to those who do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 176 (emphasis added).  The Court described civil law \xe2\x80\x9caiding and abetting\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98know[ing] that <em>the other\xe2\x80\x99s conduct constitutes a breach of duty</em> and giv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the other \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7876(b) (1977); emphasis added).  And it reviewed a Court of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of aiding and abetting as \xe2\x80\x9c(1) <em>a primary violation</em> of \xc2\xa710(b); (2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the existence of the primary violation; and (3) <em>substantial assistance given to the primary violator</em> by the aider and abettor.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added).  Faced with this question, the Court answered that \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 do not provide for this kind of \xe2\x80\x9caiding and abetting\xe2\x80\x9d liability in private suits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By way of contrast, the present case is about <em>primary</em> liability\xe2\x80\x94about individuals who allegedly themselves \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d materially false statements, not about those who help <em>others</em> to do so.  The question is whether Janus Management is <em>primarily</em> liable for violating the Act, not whether it simply helped others violate the Act.  The <em>Central Bank</em> defendant concededly did <em>not</em> make the false statements in question (others did), while here the defendants allegedly <em>did</em> make those statements.  And a rule (the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule) absolving those who allegedly <em>did</em> make false statements does not \xe2\x80\x9cfollow from\xe2\x80\x9d a rule (<em>Central Bank</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule) absolving those who concededly did <em>not</em> do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority adds that to interpret the word \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d as including those \xe2\x80\x9cwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially undermine\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Central Bank</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  Would it?  The Court in <em>Central Bank </em>specifically wrote that its holding did</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cnot mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities Acts. <em>Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who</em> employs a manipulative device or <em>makes a material misstatement</em> (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies <em>may be liable as a primary violator under 10b\xe2\x80\x935,</em> assuming <em>all</em> of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 are met.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, as far as <em>Central Bank </em>is concerned, depending upon the circumstances, board members, senior firm officials, officials tasked to develop a marketing document, large investors, or others (taken together or separately) all might<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d materially false statements subjecting themselves to primary liability.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule does not protect, it <em>extends</em>,<em> Central Bank</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding of no-liability into new territory that <em>Central Bank </em>explicitly placed outside that holding.  And by ignoring the language in which <em>Central Bank </em>did so, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule itself undermines <em>Central Bank</em>.  Where is the legal support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdraw[ing] a clean line,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7, n. 6, that so seriously conflicts with <em>Central Bank?</em>  Indeed, where is the legal support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that plaintiffs must show some kind of \xe2\x80\x9cattribution\xe2\x80\x9d of a statement to a defendant, <em>ante</em>, at 11, n. 11\xe2\x80\x94if it means plaintiffs must show, not only that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d the statement, but something more?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also refers to <em>Stoneridge, </em>but that case offers it no help.  In <em>Stoneridge</em>, firms that supplied electronic equipment to a cable television company agreed with the cable television company to enter into a series of fraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an unusually high price, thereby providing funds which the suppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable television company.  These arrangements enabled the cable television company to fool its accountants (and ultimately the public) into believing that it had more revenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really had.  As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged letters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.  Investors subsequently sued the cable television company, some of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment suppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged in a scheme to defraud securities purchasers.  In respect to most of the defendants, investors identified allegedly materially false statements contained in the cable television company\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements or similar docu- ments.  But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in-vestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was\nin the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral conversations about the scheme.  The investors argued that the equipment suppliers, \xe2\x80\x9cby participating in the transactions,\xe2\x80\x9d violated \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  <em>Stoneridge</em>, 552 U. S., at 155.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not be found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under \xc2\xa710(b).  But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment suppliers <em>had made </em>the false statements contained in the letters, contracts, and conversations.  See <em>id.,</em> at 158\xe2\x80\x93159.  Rather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether \xe2\x80\x9cany deceptive statement or act respondents made was not actionable because it did not have the requisite <em>proximate relation</em> to the investors\xe2\x80\x99 harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  And it held that these deceptive statements or actions could not provide a basis for liability because the investors could not prove sufficient <em>reliance</em> upon the particular false statements that the equipment suppliers had made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers \xe2\x80\x9chad no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 159.  And the Court went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cas a result,\xe2\x80\x9d the investors \xe2\x80\x9ccannot show reliance upon any\xe2\x80\x9d of the equipment suppliers\xe2\x80\x99 actions, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court concluded,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[the equipment suppliers\xe2\x80\x99] deceptive acts, which were not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance.  It was [the cable company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements; nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to record the transactions as it did.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 161.</p>\n<p align="left">\nInsofar as the equipment suppliers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was at issue, the fraudulent \xe2\x80\x9carrangement \xe2\x80\xa6 took place in the marketplace for goods and services, not in the investment sphere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 166.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult for me to see how <em>Stoneridge</em> \xe2\x80\x9csupport[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  No one in <em>Stoneridge </em>disputed the <em>making </em>of the relevant<em> </em>statements, the fraudulent contracts and the like.  And no one in <em>Stoneridge</em> contended that the equipment suppliers were, in fact, the<em> makers</em> of the cable company\xe2\x80\x99s misstatements.  Rather, <em>Stoneridge</em> was concerned with whether the equipment suppliers\xe2\x80\x99 <em>separate</em> statements were sufficiently disclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the basis for investor reliance.  They were not.  But this is a different inquiry than whether statements acknowledged to have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and ripe for reliance can be said to have been \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d by one or another actor.  How then does <em>Stoneridge</em> support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s new rule?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid \xe2\x80\x9ca theory of liability similar to\xe2\x80\x94but broader in application than\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa720(a)\xe2\x80\x99s liability, for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for violations of the securities laws.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)).  But that is not so.  This Court has explained that the possibility of an express remedy under the securities laws does not preclude a claim under \xc2\xa710(b).  <em>Herman &amp; MacLean</em> v. <em>Huddleston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/375/index.html">459 U. S. 375</a>, 388 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, a person who is liable under \xc2\xa720(a) controls another \xe2\x80\x9c<em>person\xe2\x80\x9d who is \xe2\x80\x9cliable\xe2\x80\x9d</em> for a securities violation. <em> Morrison</em> v. <em>National Australia Bank Ltd.</em>, 561 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n.\xc2\xa02) (\xe2\x80\x9cLiability under \xc2\xa720(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some other provision of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d).  We here examine whether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or they do not, control another person <em>who is liable</em>.  That is to say, here, the liability of some \xe2\x80\x9cother person\xe2\x80\x9d is not at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there is at least one significant category of cases that \xc2\xa710(b) may address that derivative forms of liability, such as under \xc2\xa720(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one actor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its misstatements.  Here, it may well be that the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s board of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the prospectuses.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In re Lammert</em>, Release No. 348, 93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management was aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later than 2002, but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his knowledge was never shared with the Board\xe2\x80\x9d).  And if so, \xc2\xa720(a) would not apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The possibility of guilty management and innocent board is the 13th stroke of the new rule\xe2\x80\x99s clock.  What is to happen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for the board) containing materially false statements and fools both board and public into believing they are true?  Apparently under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, in such circum-\nstances <em>no one </em>could be found to have \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d a ma-\nterially false statement\xe2\x80\x94even though under the common law the managers would likely have been guilty or liable (in analogous circumstances) for doing so as <em>principals </em>(and not as aiders and abettors).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa713.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to Crime, 89 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a principal when one uses an innocent<em> </em>third party to commit a crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7533 (1976).  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Giles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/41/index.html">300 U. S. 41</a>, 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (1937).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule it seems unlikely that the SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the authority Congress has granted it to pursue primary violators who \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d false statements or the authority that Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders and abettors to securities violations.  See \xc2\xa7104, 109 Stat. 757 (codified at 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa778t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)) (granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).  That is because the managers, not having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d the statement, would not be liable as principals and there would be no other primary violator they might have\ntried to \xe2\x80\x9caid\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabet.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>SEC</em> v. <em>DiBella</em>, 587 F.\xc2\xa03d\n553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abet-\nting requires primary violation to which offender gave \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial assistance\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that \xc2\xa720(b)  could provide a basis for liability in this case, <em>ante, </em>at 10, n.\xc2\xa010, then it should remand the case for possible amendment of the complaint.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a dearth of authority construing Section 20(b),\xe2\x80\x9d which has been thought largely \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous in 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  5B A. Jacobs, Disclosure and Remedies Under the Securities Law \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x938, p.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9372 (2011).  Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it referred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless for failing to mention \xc2\xa720(b) as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I can find nothing in \xc2\xa710(b) or in Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, its language, its history, or in precedent suggesting that Congress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a loophole of the kind that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule may well create.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, of course, does not decide the question before us.  We must still determine whether, in light of the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, Janus Management could have \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d the false statements in the prospectuses at issue.  In my view, the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The specific relationships alleged among Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the prospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus Management did \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d those statements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court and lower courts have made clear that at least <em>sometimes </em>corporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 for having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d a materially false statement even when that statement appears in a document (or is made by a third person) that the officials do not legally control.  In <em>Herman &amp; MacLean</em>, for example, this Court pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain individuals who play a part in preparing the registration statement,\xe2\x80\x9d including corporate officers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable even where \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not named as having prepared or certified\xe2\x80\x9d the registration statement.  459 U. S., at 386, n. 22.  And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in <em>Central Bank </em>that a \xe2\x80\x9clawyer, accountant, or bank,<em> </em>who \xe2\x80\xa6 makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies <em>may be liable as a primary violator under 10b\xe2\x80\x935</em>, assuming <em>all</em> of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 are met.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surprising that lower courts have found primary liability for actors without \xe2\x80\x9cultimate authority\xe2\x80\x9d over issued statements.  One court, for example, concluded that an accountant could be primarily liable for having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d false statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and certification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual reports, and other corporate materials for which he was not ultimately responsible.  <em>Anixter</em> v. <em>Home-Stake Production Co.</em>, 77 F.\xc2\xa03d 1215, 1225\xe2\x80\x931227 (CA10 1996).  In a later case postdating <em>Stoneridge</em>, that court reaffirmed that an outside consultant could be primarily liable for having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d false statements, where he drafted fraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later reviewed and certified by the firm\xe2\x80\x99s auditor, officers, and counsel.  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Wolfson</em>, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10 2008).  And another court found that a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s chief financial officer could be held primarily liable as having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d misstatements that appeared in a form 10\xe2\x80\x93K that she prepared but did not sign or file.  <em>McConville</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can also easily find lower court cases explaining that corporate officials may be liable for having \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d false statements where those officials use innocent persons as conduits through which the false statements reach the public (without necessarily attributing the false statements to the officials).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re Navarre Corp. Securities Litigation</em>, 299 F.\xc2\xa03d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liability may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to communicate false statements to market); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cabletron Systems, Inc.</em>, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test requiring legal \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d over third parties making statements as giving \xe2\x80\x9ccompany officials too much leeway to commit fraud on the market by using analysts as their mouthpieces\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Novak</em> v. <em>Kasaks</em>, 216 F.\xc2\xa03d 300, 314\xe2\x80\x93315 (CA2 2000); <em>Cooper</em> v. <em>Pickett</em>, 137 F.\xc2\xa03d 616, 624 (CA9 1997); <em>Freeland</em> v. <em>Iridium World Communications, Ltd.</em>, 545 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 59, 75\xe2\x80\x9376 (DC 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My conclusion also reflects the particular circumstances that the complaint alleges.  The complaint states that \xe2\x80\x9cJanus Management, as investment advisor to the funds, is responsible for the day-to-day management of its investment portfolio and other business affairs of the funds.  Janus Management furnishes advice and recom-mendations concerning the funds\xe2\x80\x99 investments, as well as administrative, compliance and accounting services for the funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb618, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  Each of the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s 17 officers was a vice president of Janus Management.  App. 250a\xe2\x80\x93258a.  The Fund has \xe2\x80\x9cno assets separate and apart from those they hold for shareholders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation</em>, 384 F. Supp. 2d 845, 853, n. 3 (Md. 2005).  Janus Management disseminated the fund prospectuses through its parent company\xe2\x80\x99s Web site.  Complaint \xc2\xb638, App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a.  Janus Management employees drafted and reviewed the Fund prospectuses, including language about \xe2\x80\x9cmarket timing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb631, <em>id.</em>, at 69a; <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation</em>, 590 F. Supp. 2d 741, 747 (Md. 2008).  And Janus Management may well have kept the trustees in the dark about the true \xe2\x80\x9cmarket timing\xe2\x80\x9d facts.  Complaint \xc2\xb651, App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a; <em>In re Lammert</em>, 93 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0C. Docket, at 5700.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these circumstances, as long as some managers, sometimes, can be held to have \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e\xe2\x80\x9d a materially false statement, Janus Management can be held to have done so on the facts alleged here.  The relationship between Janus Management and the Fund could hardly have been closer.  Janus Management\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in preparing and writing the relevant statements could hardly have been greater.  And there is a serious suggestion that the board itself knew little or nothing about the falsity of what was said.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 9, 13.  Unless we adopt a formal rule (as the majority here has done) that would arbitrarily exclude from the scope of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d those who manage a firm\xe2\x80\x94even when those managers perpetrate a fraud through an unknowing intermediary\xe2\x80\x94the man-\nagement company at issue here falls within that scope.  We should hold the allegations in the complaint in this respect legally sufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
