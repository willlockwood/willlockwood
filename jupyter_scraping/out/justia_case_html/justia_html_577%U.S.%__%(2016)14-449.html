Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s capital-sentencing case law does not support requiring a court to instruct a jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Buchanan </i>v. <i>Angelone</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 269\n.  Nor was such an instruction constitutionally necessary in these<i> </i>particular cases to avoid confusion.  Ambiguity in capital-sentencing instructions gives rise to constitutional error only if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable likelihood<i> </i>that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Boyde </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370\n, a bar not cleared here.  Even assuming that it would be unconstitutional to require the defense to prove mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the record belies the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the instructions caused jurors to apply such a standard of proof here.  The instructions make clear that both the existence of aggravating circumstances and the conclusion that they outweigh mitigating circumstances must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but that mitigating circumstances must merely be \xe2\x80\x9cfound to exist,\xe2\x80\x9d which does not suggest proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  No juror would have reasonably speculated that \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d was the correct burden for mitigating circumstances.

The\n \nEighth Amendment is inapposite when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim is, at bottom, that evidence was improperly admitted at a capital-sentencing proceeding.  The question is whether the allegedly improper evidence \xe2\x80\x9cso infected the sentencing proceeding with unfairness as to render the jury\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of the death penalty a denial of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romano </i>v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  In light of all the evidence presented at the guilt and penalty phases relevant to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing determination, the contention that the admission of mitigating evidence by one Carr brother could have \xe2\x80\x9cso infected\xe2\x80\x9d the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the other\xe2\x80\x99s sentence as to amount to a denial of due process is beyond the pale.  The Court presumes that the jury followed its instructions to \xe2\x80\x9cgive separate consideration to each defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bruton </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123\n, distinguished.  Joint proceedings are permissible and often preferable when the joined defendants\xe2\x80\x99 criminal conduct arises out of a single chain of events.  <i>Buchanan </i>v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 402\n.  Limiting instructions, like those given in the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 proceeding, \xe2\x80\x9coften will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Zafiro </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 534\n, that might arise from codefendants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cantagonistic\xe2\x80\x9d mitigation theories, <i>id., </i>at 538.

Gleason killed one of his co-conspirators and her boyfriend to cover up the robbery of an elderly man.  The Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 notorious Wichita crime spree culminated in the brutal rape, robbery, kidnaping, and execution-style shooting of five young men and women.  We first consider whether the Constitution required the sentencing courts to instruct the juries that mitigating circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cneed not<i> </i>be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  And second, whether the Constitution required severance of the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 joint sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Less than one month after Sidney Gleason was paroled from his sentence for attempted voluntary manslaughter, he joined a conspiracy to rob an elderly man at knifepoint.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Gleason and a companion \xe2\x80\x9ccut up\xe2\x80\x9d the elderly man to get $10 to $35 and a box of cigarettes.  299 Kan. 1127, 1136, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d 1102, 1115 (2014).  Fearing that their female co-conspirators would snitch, Gleason and his cousin, Damien Thompson, set out to kill co-conspirator Mikiala Martinez.  Gleason shot and killed Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend, and then Gleason and Thompson drove Martinez to a rural location, where Thompson strangled her for five minutes and then shot her in the chest, Gleason standing by and providing the gun for the final shot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State ultimately charged Gleason with capital murder for killing Martinez and her boyfriend, first-degree premeditated murder of the boyfriend, aggravating kidnaping of Martinez, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated robbery of the elderly man, and criminal possession of a firearm.  He was convicted on all counts except the attempted first-degree murder charge.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1134\xe2\x80\x931135, 1146, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1114, 1120.

One of them approached her vehicle and said he needed help.  When she rolled down her window, he pointed a gun at her head.  When she shifted into reverse to escape, he shot her three times, ran back to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s car, and fled the scene.  One of the gunshots severed Walenta\xe2\x80\x99s spine, and she died one month later as a result of her injuries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the night of December 14, the brothers burst into a triplex at 12727 Birchwood, where roommates Jason, Brad, and Aaron lived.  Jason\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, Holly, and Heather, a friend of Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s, were also in the house.  Armed with handguns and a golf club, the brothers forced all five into Jason\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.  They demanded that they strip naked and later ordered them into the bedroom closet.  They took Holly and Heather from the bedroom, demanded that they perform oral sex and digitally penetrate each other as the Carrs looked on and barked orders.  They forced each of the men to have sex with Holly and then with Heather.  They yelled that the men would be shot if they could not have sex with the women, so Holly\xe2\x80\x94fearing for Jason\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94performed oral sex on him in the closet before he was ordered out by the brothers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Jonathan then snatched Holly from the closet.  He ordered that she digitally penetrate herself.  He set his gun between her knees on the floor.  And he raped her.  Then he raped Heather.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reginald took Brad, Jason, Holly, and Aaron one-by-one to various ATMs to withdraw cash.  When the victims returned to the house, their torture continued.  Holly uri-nated in the closet because of fright.  Jonathan found an engagement ring hidden in the bedroom that Jason was keeping as a surprise for Holly.  Pointing his gun at Jason, he had Jason identify the ring while Holly was sitting nearby in the closet.  Then Reginald took Holly from the closet, said he was not going to shoot her yet, and raped her on the dining-room floor strewn with boxes of Christmas decorations.  He forced her to turn around, ejaculated into her mouth, and forced her to swallow.  In a nearby bathroom, Jonathan again raped Heather and then again raped Holly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At 2 a.m.\xe2\x80\x94three hours after the mayhem began\xe2\x80\x94the brothers decided it was time to leave the house.  They attempted to put all five victims in the trunk of Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s Honda Civic.  Finding that they would not all fit, they jammed the three young men into the trunk.  They directed Heather to the front of the car and Holly to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s pickup truck, driven by Reginald.  Once the vehicles arrived at a snow-covered field, they instructed Jason and Brad, still naked, and Aaron to kneel in the snow.  Holly cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to shoot us.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holly and Heather were then ordered to kneel in the snow.  Holly went to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s side; Heather, to Aaron.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holly heard the first shot, heard Aaron plead with the brothers not to shoot, heard the second shot, heard the screams, heard the third shot, and the fourth.  She felt the blow of the fifth shot to her head, but remained kneeling.  They kicked her so she would fall face-first into the snow and ran her over in the pickup truck.  But she survived, because a hair clip she had fastened to her hair that night deflected the bullet.  She went to Jason, took off her sweater, the only scrap of clothing the brothers had let her wear, and tied it around his head to stop the bleeding from his eye.  She rushed to Brad, then Aaron, and then Heather.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Spotting a house with white Christmas lights in the distance, Holly started running toward it for help\xe2\x80\x94naked, skull shattered, and without shoes, through the snow and over barbed-wire fences.  Each time a car passed on the nearby road, she feared it was the brothers returning and camouflaged herself by lying down in the snow.  She made it to the house, rang the doorbell, knocked.  A man opened the door, and she relayed as quickly as she could the events of the night to him, and minutes later to a 911 dispatcher, fearing that she would not live.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holly lived, and retold this play-by-play of the night\xe2\x80\x99s events to the jury.  Investigators also testified that the brothers returned to the Birchwood house after leaving the five friends for dead, where they ransacked the place for valuables and (for good measure) beat Holly\xe2\x80\x99s dog, Nikki, to death with a golf club.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State charged each of the brothers with more than 50 counts, including murder, rape, sodomy, kidnaping, burglary, and robbery, and the jury returned separate guilty verdicts.  It convicted Reginald of one count of kidnaping, aggravated robbery, aggravated battery, and criminal damage to property for the Schreiber carjacking, and one count of first-degree felony murder for the Walenta shooting.  Jonathan was acquitted of all counts relatedto the Schreiber carjacking but convicted of first-degree felony murder for the Walenta shooting.  For the Birchwood murders, the jury convicted each brother of 4 counts of capital murder, 1 count of attempted first-degree murder, 5 counts of aggravated kidnaping, 9 counts of aggravated robbery, 20 counts of rape or attempted rape, 3 counts of aggravated criminal sodomy, 1 count each of aggravated burglary and burglary, 1 count of theft, and 1 count of cruelty to animals.  The jury also convicted Reg-inald of three counts of unlawful possession of a firearm.  300 Kan. 1, 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d 544, 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State sought the death penalty for each of the four Birchwood murders, and the brothers were sentenced together.  The State relied on the guilt-phase evidence, including Holly\xe2\x80\x99s two days of testimony, as evidence of four aggravating circumstances: that the defendants knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death to more than one person; that they committed the crimes for the purpose of receiving money or items of monetary value; that they committed the crimes to prevent arrest or pro-secution; and that they committed the crimes in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner.  <i>Id</i>., at 258\xe2\x80\x93259, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 708.  After hearing each brother\xe2\x80\x99s case for mitigation, the jury issued separate verdicts of death for Reginald and Jonathan.  It found unanimously that the State proved the existence of the four aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, justifying four separate verdicts of death for each brother for the murders of Jason, Brad, Aaron, and Heather.  App. in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93449 etc., pp. 461\xe2\x80\x93492.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the death penalties in both cases.  It held that the instructions used in both Gleason\xe2\x80\x99s and the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing violated the\n \nEighth Amendment because they \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating circumstances need only be proved to the satisfaction of the individual juror in that juror\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision and not beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan.<i>,</i> at 1196, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147 (Gleason); 300 Kan., at 303, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 733 (Reginald Carr); 300 Kan. 340, 369\xe2\x80\x93370, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d 1195, 1213 (2014) (Jonathan Carr).  Without that instruction, according to the court, the jury \xe2\x80\x9cwas left to speculate as to the correct burden of proof for mitigating circumstances, and reasonable jurors might have believed they could not consider mitigating circumstances not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.  This, the court concluded, might have caused jurors to exclude relevant mitigating evidence from their consideration.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Kansas Supreme Court also held that the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 death sentences had to be vacated because of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to sever their sentencing proceedings, thereby violating the brothers\xe2\x80\x99\n \nEighth Amendment right \xe2\x80\x9cto an individualized capital sentencing determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  300 Kan., at 275, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 717; 300 Kan., at 368, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1212.  According to the court, the joint trial \xe2\x80\x9cinhibited the jury\xe2\x80\x99s individualized consideration of [Jonathan] because of family characteristics tending to demonstrate future dangerousness that he shared with his brother\xe2\x80\x9d; and his brother\xe2\x80\x99s visible handcuffs prejudiced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of his sentence.  300 Kan., at 275, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 717<i>.</i>  As for Reginald, he was prejudiced, according to the Kansas Supreme Court, by Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of him as the corrupting older brother.  <i>Id.</i>, at 276, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 717.  Moreover, Reginald was prejudiced by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s cross-examination of their sister, who testified that she thought Reginald had admitted to her that he was the shooter.  <i>Id</i>., at 279, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 719.  (She later backtracked and testified, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember who was, you know, shot by who[m].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>)  The Kansas Supreme Court opined that the presumption that the jury followed its instructions to consider each defendant separately was \xe2\x80\x9cdefeated by logic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 280, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 719.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he defendants\xe2\x80\x99 joint upbringing in the maelstrom that was their family and their influence on and interactions with one another .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. simply was not amenable to orderly separation and analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 719\xe2\x80\x93720.  The Kansas Supreme Court found itself unable to \xe2\x80\x9csay that the death verdict was unattributable, at least in part, to this error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 282, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 720.  We granted certio-rari.  575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We first turn to the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the\n \nEighth Amendment required these capital-sentencing courts to instruct the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Before considering the merits of that contention, we consider Gleason\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to our jurisdiction.  According to Gleason, the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests on adequate and independent state-law grounds.  This argument is a familiar one.  We rejected it in <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Marsh</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163,\n169 (2006)\n.  Like the defendant in that case, Gleason urges that the decision below rests only on a rule of Kansas law announced in <i>State </i>v. <i>Kleypas</i>, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 139 (2001) (<i>per curiam</i>)\xe2\x80\x94a rule later reiterated in <i>State </i>v.<i> Scott</i>, 286 Kan. 54, 183 P.\xc2\xa03d 801 (2008) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  As we stated in <i>Marsh</i>, <i>\xe2\x80\x9cKleypas</i>, itself, rested on federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 169.  So too does the relevant passage of <i>Scott</i>, which rested on <i>Kleypas</i>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the constitutional rule that jurors need not agree on mitigating circumstances.  See <i>Scott</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 106\xe2\x80\x93107, 183 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 837\xe2\x80\x93838.  The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case acknowledged as much, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cstatements from <i>Kleypas </i>implicate the broader\n \nEighth Amendment principle prohibiting barriers that preclude a sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of all relevant mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1195, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion leaves no room for doubt that it was relying on the Federal Constitution.  It stated that the instruction it required \xe2\x80\x9cprotects a capital defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <i>\n \nEighth Amendment</i> right to individualized sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d that the absence of the instruction \xe2\x80\x9cimplicat[ed] Gleason\xe2\x80\x99s right to individualized sentencing under the <i>\n \nEighth Amendment</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d and that vacatur of Gleason\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence was the \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsequen[ce]\xe2\x80\x9d of <i>\n \nEighth Amendment </i>error.  <i>Id</i>., at 1196\xe2\x80\x931197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147\xe2\x80\x931148 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For this reason, the criticism leveled by the dissent is misdirected.  It generally would have been \xe2\x80\x9cnone of our business\xe2\x80\x9d had the Kansas Supreme Court vacated Gleason\xe2\x80\x99s and the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 death sentences on state-law grounds.  <i>Marsh, </i>548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 184 (Scalia, J., concurring).  But it decidedly did not.  And when the Kansas Supreme Court time and again invalidates death sentences because it says the Federal Constitution <i>requires</i> it, \xe2\x80\x9creview by this Court, far from <i>undermining </i>state autonomy, is the only possible way to <i>vindicate </i>it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we correct a state court\xe2\x80\x99s federal errors, <i>we return power to the State, and to its people.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The state courts may experiment all they want with their own constitutions, and often do in the wake of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  See Sutton, <i>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</i> And Its Aftermath, 94 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1963, 1971\xe2\x80\x931977 (2008).  But what a state court cannot do is experiment with our Federal Constitution and expect to elude this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review so long as victory goes to the criminal defendant.  \xe2\x80\x9cTurning a blind eye\xe2\x80\x9d in such cases \xe2\x80\x9cwould change the uniform \xe2\x80\x98law of the land\xe2\x80\x99 into a crazy quilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marsh</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 185.  And it would enable state courts to blame the unpopular death-sentence reprieve of the most horrible criminals upon the Federal Constitution when it is in fact their own doing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We turn, then, to the merits of the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the\n \nEighth Amendment requires capital-sentencing courts in Kansas \xe2\x80\x9cto affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Approaching the question in the abstract, and without reference to our capital-sentencing case law, we doubt whether it is even possible to apply a standard of proof to the mitigating-factor determination (the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cselection phase\xe2\x80\x9d of a capital-sentencing proceeding).  It is possible to do so for the aggravating-factor determination (the so-called \xe2\x80\x9celigibility phase\xe2\x80\x9d), because that is a purely factual determination.  The facts justifying death set forth in the Kansas statute either did or did not exist\xe2\x80\x94and one can require the finding that they did exist to be made beyond a reasonable doubt.  Whether mitigation exists, however, is largely a judgment call (or perhaps a value call); what one juror might consider mitigating another might not.  And of course the ultimate question whether mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances is mostly a question of mercy\xe2\x80\x94the quality of which, as we know, is not strained.  It would mean nothing, we think, to tell the jury that the defendants must deserve mercy beyond a reasonable doubt; or must more-likely-than-not deserve it.  It <i>would</i> be possible, of course, to instruct the jury that <i>the facts establishing</i> mitigating circumstances need only be proved by a preponderance, leaving the judgment whether those facts are indeed mitigating, and whether they outweigh the aggravators, to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion without a standard of proof.  If we were to hold that the Constitution requires the mitigating-factor determination to be divided into its factual component and its judgmental component, and the former to be accorded a burden-of-proof instruction, we doubt whether that would produce anything but jury confusion.  In the last analysis, jurors will accord mercy if they deem it appropriate, and withhold mercy if they do not, which is what our case law is designed to achieve.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, our case law does not require capital sentencing courts \xe2\x80\x9cto affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  In <i>Buchanan </i>v. <i>Angelone</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 269 (1998)\n, we upheld a death sentence even though the trial court \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to provide the jury with express guidance on the concept of mitigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 275.  Likewise in <i>Weeks </i>v. <i>Angelone</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 225 (2000)\n, we reaffirmed that the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cnever held that the State must structure in a particular way the manner in which juries consider mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and rejected the contention that it was constitutionally deficient to instruct jurors to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consider a mitigating circumstance if you find there is evidence to support it,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d without additional guidance.  <i>Id.</i>, at 232\xe2\x80\x93233.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Equally unavailing is the contention that even if an instruction that mitigating evidence need not be \xe2\x80\x9cproven beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d is not always required, it was constitutionally necessary in <i>these </i>cases to avoid confusion.  Ambiguity in capital-sentencing instructions gives rise to constitutional error only if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a <i>reasonable likelihood </i>that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Boyde </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370,\n380 (1990)\n (emphasis added).  The alleged confusion stemming from the jury instructions used at the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 sentencings does not clear that bar.  A meager \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d of confusion is not enough.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>As an initial matter, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 argument rests on the assumption that it would be unconstitutional to require the defense to prove mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  Assuming without deciding that that is the case, the record belies the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the instructions caused jurors to apply that standard of proof.  The defendants focus upon the following instruction: \xe2\x80\x9cThe State has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there are one or more aggravating circumstances and that they are not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances found to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93452, p. 133 (Instr. 8).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  The juxtaposition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, so goes the argument, caused the jury to speculate that mitigating circumstances must also be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  299 Kan., at 1197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.  It seems to us quite the opposite.  The instruction makes clear that both the existence of aggravating circumstances and the conclusion that they outweigh mitigating circumstances must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; mitigating circumstances themselves, on the other hand, must merely be \xe2\x80\x9cfound to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  That same description, mitigating circumstances \xe2\x80\x9c<i>found to exist</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d is contained in three other instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93452, at 133 (Instrs. 7, 9, and 10) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94unsurprisingly, since it recites the Kansas statute, see Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x934624(e) (1995).  \xe2\x80\x9cFound to exist\xe2\x80\x9d certainly does not suggest proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  The instructions as a whole distinguish clearly between aggravating and mitigating circumstances: \xe2\x80\x9c<i>The State </i>has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there are one or more aggravating circumstances .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d and the jury must decide unanimously that the State met that burden.

Not once do the instructions say that defense counsel bears the burden of proving the facts constituting a mitigating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94nor would that make much sense, since one of the mitigating circumstances is (curiously) \xe2\x80\x9cmercy,\xe2\x80\x9d which simply is not a fac-tual determination.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reject the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that jurors were \xe2\x80\x9cleft to speculate as to the correct burden of proof for mitigating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.  For the reasons we have described, no juror would reasonably have speculated that mitigating circumstances must be proved by any particular standard, let alone beyond a reasonable doubt.  The reality is that jurors do not \xe2\x80\x9cpars[e] instructions for subtle shades of meaning in the same way that lawyers might.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Boyde</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 381.  The instructions repeatedly told the jurors to consider <i>any </i>mitigating factor, meaning any aspect of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 background or the circumstances of their offense.  Jurors would not have misunderstood these instructions to prevent their consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We turn next to the contention that a joint capital-sentencing proceeding in the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 cases violated the defendants\xe2\x80\x99\n \nEighth Amendment right to an \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized sentencing determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  300 Kan., at 276, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 717.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Kansas Supreme Court agreed with the defendants that, because of the joint sentencing proceeding, one defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence put a thumb on death\xe2\x80\x99s scale for the other, in violation of the other\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nEighth Amendment rights.  <i>Ibid</i>.  It accepted Reginald\xe2\x80\x99s contention that he was prejudiced by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of him as the corrupting older brother.  And it agreed that Reginald was prejudiced by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s cross-examination of their sister, who equivocated about whether Reginald admitted to her that he was the shooter.  (Reginald has all but abandoned that implausible theory of prejudice before this Court and contends only that the State \xe2\x80\x9clikely would not have introduced any such testimony\xe2\x80\x9d had he been sentenced alone.

Jonathan asserted that he was prejudiced by evidence associating him with his dangerous older brother, which caused the jury to perceive him as an incurable sociopath.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Both speculate that the evidence assertedly prejudicial to them would have been inadmissible in severed proceedings under Kansas law.  The Kansas Supreme Court also launched a broader attack on the joint proceedings, contending that the joinder rendered it impossible for the jury to consider the Carrs\xe2\x80\x99 relative moral culpability and to determine individually whether they were entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cmercy.\xe2\x80\x9d  300 Kan., at 278, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 718\xe2\x80\x93719.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whatever the merits of defendants\xe2\x80\x99 procedural objections, we will not shoehorn them into the\n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the United States as <i>amicus curiae </i>intimates, the\n \nEighth Amendment is inapposite when each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim is, at bottom, that the jury considered evidence that would not have been admitted in a severed proceeding, and that the joint trial clouded the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of mitigating evidence like \xe2\x80\x9cmercy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 24, n.\xc2\xa08.

The mere admission of evidence that might not otherwise have been admitted in a severed proceeding does not demand the automatic vacatur of a death sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of all the evidence presented at the guilt and penalty phases relevant to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing determination, the contention that the admission of mitigating evidence by one brother could have \xe2\x80\x9cso infected\xe2\x80\x9d the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the other\xe2\x80\x99s sentence as to amount to a denial of due process is beyond the pale.  To begin with, the court instructed the jury that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust give separate consideration to each defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d that each was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to have his sentence decided on the evidence and law which is applicable to him,\xe2\x80\x9d and that any evidence in the penalty phase \xe2\x80\x9climited to only one defendant should not be considered by you as to the other defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93450, at 501 (Instr. 3).  The court gave defendant-specific instructions for aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  <i>Id.,</i> at 502\xe2\x80\x93508 (Instrs. 5, 6, 7, and 8).  And the court instructed the jury to consider the \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparticular defendant\xe2\x80\x9d by using four separate verdict forms for each defendant, one for each murdered occupant of the Birchwood house.  <i>Id.,</i> at 509 (Instr. 10); App. in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93449 etc., at 461\xe2\x80\x93492.  We presume the jury followed these instructions and considered each defendant separately when deciding to impose a sentence of death for each of the brutal murders.  <i>Romano</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The contrary conclusion of the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94that the presumption that jurors followed these instructions was \xe2\x80\x9cdefeated by logic,\xe2\x80\x9d 300 Kan., at 280, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 719\xe2\x80\x94is untenable.  The Carrs implausibly liken the prejudice resulting from the joint sentencing proceeding to the prejudice infecting the joint trial in <i>Bruton </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123 (1968)\n, where the prosecution admitted hearsay evidence of a codefendant\xe2\x80\x99s confession implicating the defendant.  That particular violation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation rights, incriminating evidence of the most persuasive sort, ineradicable, as a practical matter, from the jury\xe2\x80\x99s mind, justified what we have described as a narrow departure from the presumption that jurors follow their instructions, <i>Richardson </i>v.<i> Marsh</i>,\n\n481 U. S. 200,\n207 (1987)\n.  We have declined to extend that exception, <i>id.,</i> at 211, and have continued to apply the presumption to instructions regarding mitigating evidence in capital-sentencing proceedings, see, <i>e.g., Weeks</i>, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234.  There is no reason to think the jury could not follow its instruction to consider the defendants separately in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Joint proceedings are not only permissible but are often preferable when the joined defendants\xe2\x80\x99 criminal conduct arises out of a single chain of events.

Only the most extravagant speculation would lead to the conclusion that the supposedly prejudicial evidence rendered the Carr brothers\xe2\x80\x99 joint sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair.  It is beyond reason to think that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death verdicts were caused by the identification of Reginald as the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupter\xe2\x80\x9d or of Jonathan as the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupted,\xe2\x80\x9d the jury\xe2\x80\x99s viewing of Reginald\xe2\x80\x99s handcuffs, or the sister\xe2\x80\x99s retracted statement that Reginald fired the final shots.

I see no reason to intervene in cases like these\xe2\x80\x94and plenty of reasons not to.  Kansas has not violated any federal constitutional right.  If anything, the State has overprotected its citizens based on its interpretation of state and federal law.  For reasons ably articulated by my predecessors and colleagues and because I worry that cases like these prevent States from serving as necessary laboratories for experimenting with how best to guarantee defendants a fair trial, I would dismiss the writs as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court vacated three death sentences\xe2\x80\x94the sentences of Sidney Gleason and the Carr brothers, Reginald and Jonathan\xe2\x80\x94because of constitutional errors in the penalty phases of their trials.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All three men were tried under jury instructions that did not include language previously mandated by the Kansas Supreme Court.  The instructions did not state that, under Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 statutory scheme, mitigating circumstances need only be proven to an individual juror\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction and not beyond a reasonable doubt.  299 Kan. 1127, 1192\xe2\x80\x931197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d 1102, 1145\xe2\x80\x931148 (2014) (Sidney Gleason); 300 Kan. 1, 302\xe2\x80\x93303, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d 544, 732\xe2\x80\x93733 (2014) (Reginald Carr); 300 Kan. 340, 368\xe2\x80\x93369, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d 1195, 1213 (2014) (Jonathan Carr).  The court found that the instructions therefore both undermined Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 state law and created a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood that the jury .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents consideration\xe2\x80\x9d of mitigating evidence as required by the Federal Constitution.  299 Kan., at 1191\xe2\x80\x931197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1144\xe2\x80\x931148 (quoting <i>Boyde</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370,\n380 (1990)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Kansas Supreme Court also vacated the Carr brothers\xe2\x80\x99 death sentences because they were jointly tried at the penalty phase.  The court concluded that each brother\xe2\x80\x99s particular case for mitigation compromised the other brother\xe2\x80\x99s case and therefore that trying them jointly violated the\n \nEighth Amendment right to individualized sentencing.  The error was not harmless, the Kansas Supreme Court found, because an \xe2\x80\x9cespecially damning subset\xe2\x80\x9d of the evidence presented might not have been admitted in separate penalty proceedings.  300 Kan., at 275\xe2\x80\x93282, 331 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 717\xe2\x80\x93720; 300 Kan., at 369\xe2\x80\x93370, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1212.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Kansas attorney general requested certiorari, alleging that it would best serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest for a federal court to intervene and correct the Kansas Supreme Court.  This Court complied, even though there was no suggestion that the Kansas Supreme Court had violated any federal constitutional right.  The majority now reverses the Kansas Supreme Court on both points.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even where a state court has wrongly decided an \xe2\x80\x9cimportant question of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d Sup. Ct. Rule 10, we often decline to grant certiorari, instead reserving such grants for instances where the benefits of hearing a case outweigh the costs of so doing.  My colleagues and predecessors have effectively set forth many of the costs of granting certiorari in cases where state courts grant relief to criminal defendants: We risk issuing opinions that, while not strictly advisory, may have little effect if a lower court is able to reinstate its holding as a matter of state law.  <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50,\n66 (2010)\n (Stevens, J., dissenting).  We expend resources on cases where the only concern is that a State has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overprotected\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d its citizens.  <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Long</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1032,\n1068 (1983)\n (Stevens, J., dissenting).  We intervene in an intrastate dispute between the State\xe2\x80\x99s executive and its judiciary rather than entrusting the State\xe2\x80\x99s structure of government to sort it out.  See <i>Coleman</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722\n\xe2\x80\x93767 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  And we lose valuable data about the best methods of protecting constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x94a particular concern in cases like these, where the federal constitutional question turns on the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of jury confusion, an empirical question best answered with evidence from many state courts.  Cf. <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9331 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The cases here demonstrate yet another cost of granting certiorari to correct a state court\xe2\x80\x99s overprotection of federal rights: In explaining that the Federal Constitution does not protect some particular right, it is natural to buttress the conclusion by explaining why that right is not very important.  In so doing, the Court risks discouraging States from adopting valuable procedural protections even as a matter of their own state law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">State experimentation with how best to guarantee a fair trial to criminal defendants is an essential aspect of our federalism scheme.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Linde, First Things First: Rediscovering the States\xe2\x80\x99 Bill of Rights, 9 U. Balt. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 379, 393 (1980).  The Federal Constitution guarantees only a minimum slate of protections; States can and do provide individual rights above that constitutional floor.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States: the Revival of State Constitutions as Guardians of Constitutional Rights, 61 N.\xc2\xa0Y. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 535, 548\xe2\x80\x93550 (1986).  That role is particularly important in the criminal arena because state courts preside over many millions more criminal cases than their federal counterparts and so are more likely to identify protections important to a fair trial.  Compare<i> </i>Court Statistics Project, Examining the Work of State Courts: An Analysis of 2010 State Court Caseloads 19\xe2\x80\x9321 (2012), with Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Justice Statistics 2011\xe2\x80\x932012, pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9320 (Jan. 2015) (Tables 11 and 12).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in these cases illustrates how an unnecessary grant of certiorari can lead to unexpected costs by disrupting this sort of state experimentation.  Take the first question presented in these cases.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s actual holding is that the\n \nEighth Amendment does not require an instruction specifying that mitigating factors need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The\n \nEighth Amendment has nothing to say about whether such an instruction is wise as a question of state law or policy.  But the majority nonetheless uses this Court\xe2\x80\x99s considerable influence to call into question the logic of specifying <i>any</i> burden of proof as to mitigating circumstances.  The majority claims that while assessing an aggravating factor is \xe2\x80\x9ca purely factual determination,\xe2\x80\x9d assessing mitigation involves \xe2\x80\x9ca judgment call (or perhaps a value call)\xe2\x80\x9d and is thus not amenable to burdens of proof.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  Short of dividing the mitigating factor \xe2\x80\x9cinto its factual component and its judgmental component,\xe2\x80\x9d and issuing burden-of-proof instructions only as to the former, the majority wonders \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it is even possible to apply a standard of proof to the mitigating-factor determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By this observation, and with no experience with the needs of juries, the majority denigrates the many States that <i>do </i>specify a burden of proof for the existence of mitigating factors as a matter of state law, presumably under the belief that it is, in fact, \xe2\x80\x9cpossible\xe2\x80\x9d to do so.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*  Brief for Respondent in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93452, pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, and n.\xc2\xa06.  Some States even recommend an instruction specifying that mitigating factors need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Idaho Jury Instr., Crim., ICJI 1718, Jury Deliberations (2010); Okla. Jury Instr., Crim, OUJI\xe2\x80\x93CR 4\xe2\x80\x9378 (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of severance likewise short circuits state experimentation.  The majority is not content to hold that the\n \nEighth Amendment does not, strictly speaking, require severance of capital penalty proceedings.  Instead, it goes on to explain why joint capital sentencing proceedings are not only permissible under the Federal Constitution but are, in fact, preferable as a policy matter: \xe2\x80\x9cBetter that two defendants who have together committed the same crimes be placed side-by-side to have their fates determined by a single jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 17.  The majority even intimates that severed proceedings may be worse for defendants: \xe2\x80\x9cTo forbid joinder in capital-sentencing proceedings would, perversely, <i>increase</i> the odds of \xe2\x80\x98wanto[n] and freakis[h]\xe2\x80\x99 imposition of death sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Gregg</i> v. <i>Georgia</i>,\n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 153\n\xe2\x80\x93207 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So much for Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s, and Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing regimes, all of which routinely allow severance at both phases of capital proceedings.  See Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa717\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x934 (2013) (upon request, defendants must be tried separately in capital cases); Miss. Code Ann. \xc2\xa799\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x9347 (2015) (same); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72945.20 (Lexis 2014) (capital defendants shall be tried separately unless good cause is shown for a joint trial).  There is no evidence that any of those three States adopted a severance regime based on a misunderstanding of the\n \nEighth Amendment.  But without any empirical foundation or any basis in experience, the majority asserts that such regimes may increase the odds of arbitrariness.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority claims that we \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98return power to the State, and to its people,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d when we explain that the Federal Constitution does not require a particular result.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9 (emphasis deleted).  But that is only so when the Court is able to pass solely on the federal constitutional ground and not the wisdom of a state holding on an equivalent question.  Though the Court pretends that it sends back cases like this one with a clean slate, it rarely fully erases its thoughts on the virtues of the procedural protectionat issue.  By placing a thumb on the scale against aState adopting\xe2\x80\x94even as a matter of state law\xe2\x80\x94proce-dural protections the Constitution does not require, the Court risks turning the Federal Constitution into aceiling, rather than a floor, for the protection of individual liberties.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I see no reason why these three cases out of the Kansas Supreme Court warranted our intervention given the costs that I have just described and those described by my predecessors and colleagues, see <i>supra,</i> at 3.  No federal right has been compromised.  And nobody disputes that the State of Kansas could, as a matter of state law, reach the same outcome.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps most importantly, both of the questions on which the Court granted certiorari turn on specific features of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing scheme.  As a result, the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is unlikely to have much salience for other States.  If the Kansas Supreme Court was wrong, its wrong opinion will not subvert federal law on a broader scale.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Kansas court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the jury instruction question aimed to \xe2\x80\x9c<i>both</i> preserv[e] the [state] statute\xe2\x80\x99s favorable distinction <i>and</i> protec[t] a capital defendant\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nEighth Amendment right to individualized sentencing by ensuring jurors are not precluded from considering all relevant mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1196, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147 (emphasis added).  The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was thus informed by a combination of federal and state considerations.  A decision that expressly relies on a State\xe2\x80\x99s unique statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x94as did the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s here\xe2\x80\x94has limited potential for influencing other States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is not absurd to conclude that a juror unfamiliar with the mechanics of the law might be confused by Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 jury instructions, which almost always mention aggravating and mitigating instructions in the same breath.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1196\xe2\x80\x931197, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147\xe2\x80\x931148. <i> </i>The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion rested largely on the specific language and ordering of that State\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.  Other States\xe2\x80\x99 jury instructions may be less likely to have the same effect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the decision below was made against the unique backdrop of trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 failure to implement the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier demands for a change to jury instructions in capital cases.  In a 2001 case, the Kansas Supreme Court considered the jury instructions insufficiently confusing to reverse the judgment, but sufficiently confusing to demand higher clarity going forward: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny instruction dealing with the consideration of mitigating circumstances should state (1) they need to be proved only to the satisfaction of the individual juror in the juror\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision and not beyond a reason-able doubt and (2) mitigating circumstances do not need to be found by all members of the jury in order to be considered in an individual juror\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>State </i>v. <i>Kleypas</i>, 272 Kan. 894, 1078, 40 P.\xc2\xa03d 139, 268.<i> </i>The Kansas pattern instructions were then revised to include consideration (2), but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinexplicably,\xe2\x80\x9d as the court noted in <i>Gleason</i>\xe2\x80\x94not consideration (1).  299 Kan., at 1193, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1145.  The Kansas Supreme Court reiterated the two requirements for any jury instruction in 2008, see <i>State </i>v. <i>Scott</i>, 286 Kan. 54, 106\xe2\x80\x93108, 183 P.\xc2\xa03d 801, 837, and the pattern instructions were finally changed in 2011, see 299 Kan., at 1193, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1145.  But Gleason and the Carr brothers were tried in the 10-year delay between the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s initial admonition and when the jury instructions were finally edited.  The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Gleason</i> may have rested in part on a \xe2\x80\x9cbroader\n \nEighth Amendment principle,\xe2\x80\x9d but it also rested on some lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 failure to give instructions reflecting the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crepeated recognition of the required content.\xe2\x80\x9d  299 Kan., at 1195, 329 P.\xc2\xa03d, 1146, 1147.  Given this context, the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is particularly unlikely to undermine other States or the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same goes for the severance question.  The Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision depended on the \xe2\x80\x9cespecially damning subset\xe2\x80\x9d of the aggravating evidence presented that may not have been admitted in a severed proceeding under Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 capital punishment scheme and evidentiary rules, such as evidence that one brother was a bad influence on the other.  <i>Ibid.  </i>But the difference between a joint penalty phase and a severed penalty phase may be of limited significance in States where the same evidence may be admitted in joint and severed proceedings.  Cf. <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Sanders</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 212,\n217 (2006)\n; L. Palmer, The Death Penalty in the United States: A Complete Guide to Federal and State Laws 137 (2d ed. 2014).  It thus seems to me unlikely that the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion would have proven instructive in other States, even though it was couched in the language of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">There may, of course, be rare cases where certiorari is warranted in which a state prosecutor alleges that a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court has overprotected a criminal defendant.  These circumstances may include: Where a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in favor of a criminal defendant implicates another constitutional right, see, <i>e.g., Nebraska Press Assn.</i> v. <i>Stuart</i>,\n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 539,\n547 (1976)\n; where a state court indicates a hostility to applying federal precedents, <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Meyers</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 380,\n383 (1984)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>) (Stevens, J., dissenting); or where a state court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of relief is particularly likely to destabilize or significantly interfere with federal policy.  None of those circumstances, and no comparable interest, is present in these cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Carr brothers committed acts of \xe2\x80\x9calmost inconceivable cruelty and depravity,\xe2\x80\x9d and the majority is understandably anxious to ensure they receive their just deserts.  (So anxious, in fact, that it reaches out to address a question on which we did not grant certiorari at all.  <i>Ante,</i> at 17).  But I do not believe that interest justifies not only \xe2\x80\x9ccorrecting\xe2\x80\x9d the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s error but also calling into question the procedures of other States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The standard adage teaches that hard cases make bad law.  See <i>Northern Securities Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n193 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197,\n364 (1904)\n (Holmes, J., dissenting).  I fear that these cases suggest a corollary: Shocking cases make too much law.  Because I believe the Court should not have granted certiorari here, I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0I leave aside the merits of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s questionable distinction, though I cannot see how the jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Carr brothers committed their crime \xe2\x80\x9cin an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one of the aggravating circumstances found by the Carr brothers\xe2\x80\x99 jury\xe2\x80\x94involved any less of a judgment or value call than the mitigating circumstances alleged.
