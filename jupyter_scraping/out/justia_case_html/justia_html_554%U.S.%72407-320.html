S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A), (c), and (d), normally apply equally to all competitors for a seat and their authorized committees.  However, \xc2\xa7319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a), part of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cMillionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds, the \xe2\x80\x9copposition personal funds amount\xe2\x80\x9d (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.  The OPFA is a statistic comparing competing candidates\xe2\x80\x99 personal expenditures and taking account of certain other fundraising.  When a \xe2\x80\x9cself-financing\xe2\x80\x9d candidate\xe2\x80\x99s personal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass $350,000, a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the normal limitations, but his opponent, the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-self-financing\xe2\x80\x9d candidate, may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit from individuals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate contributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C).  Because calculating the OPFA requires certain information about the self-financing candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign assets and personal expenditures, \xc2\xa7319(b) requires him to file an initial \xe2\x80\x9cdeclaration of intent\xe2\x80\x9d revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000, and to make additional disclosures to the other candidates, their national parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as his personal expenditures exceed certain benchmarks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellant Davis, a candidate for a House seat in 2004 and 2006 who lost both times to the incumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006 election, in compliance with \xc2\xa7319(b), that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds.  After the FEC informed him it had reason to believe he had violated \xc2\xa7319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign, he filed this suit for a declaration that \xc2\xa7319 is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the FEC from enforcing the section during the 2006 election.  The District Court concluded <em>sU. S.onte </em>that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted the FEC summary judgment.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction to hear Davis\xe2\x80\x99 appeal.

When he filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by \xc2\xa7319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds.  He also faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications once he passed the $350,000 mark.  Securing a declaration that \xc2\xa7319(b) is unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures and also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged \xc2\xa7319(b) violations during his 2004 campaign.  Davis also has standing to challenge \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical contribution limits.  The standing inquiry focuses on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed, see, e.g.,</em> <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 180, and a party facing prospective injury has standing where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 102.  Davis faced the requisite injury from \xc2\xa7319(a) when he filed suit: He had already declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his personal expenditure by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The FEC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction because Davis\xe2\x80\x99 claims are moot also fails.  In <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL)</em>, 551 U. S. ___, this Court rejected a very similar claim of mootness, finding that the case \xe2\x80\x9cfit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___.  That \xe2\x80\x9cexception applies where \xe2\x80\x98(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  First, despite BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s command that the case be expedited to the greatest possible extent and Davis\xe2\x80\x99 request that his case be resolved before the 2006 election, the case could not be resolved before the 2006 election.  See <em>id.,</em> at ___.  Second, the FEC has conceded that Davis\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if he planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat, and he subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so.  See <em>id.,</em> at ___ .  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment.  If \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s elevated contribution limits applied across the board to all candidates, Davis would have no constitutional basis for challenging them.  Section 319(a), however, raises the limits only for non-self-financing candidates and only when the self-financing candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded.  This Court has never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates competing against each other, and it agrees with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.  In <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, the Court soundly rejected a cap on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech, holding that a \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate \xe2\x80\xa6 has a First Amendment right to \xe2\x80\xa6 vigorously and tirelessly \xe2\x80\xa6 advocate his own election,\xe2\x80\x9d and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r,]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t]\xe2\x80\x9d restraint on that right, <em>id., </em>at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  It found the cap at issue not justified by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he primary governmental interest\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 53, or by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.,</em> at 54.  <em>Buckley </em>is instructive here.  While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right, requiring him to choose between the right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  The resulting drag on First Amendment rights is not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 54\xe2\x80\x9357, and n. 65, distinguished.  The burden is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption, see <em>id.,</em> at 53.  Nor can an interest in leveling electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth justify \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical limits, see <em>id.,</em> at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  The Court has never recognized this interest as a legitimate objective and doing so would have ominous implications for the voters\xe2\x80\x99 authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office.  Finally, the Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa7319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects resulting from the tight limits federal election law places on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures.  Whatever this argument\xe2\x80\x99s merits as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of expenditure and contributions limits, which this Court has applied in subsequent cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7319(a) is unconstitutional, \xc2\xa7319(b)\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements, which were designed to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits, are as well.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 64, so the Court closely scrutinizes such requirements, <em>id.,</em> at 75.  For significant encroachments to survive, there must be \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98relevant correlation\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98substantial relation\xe2\x80\x99 between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed\xe2\x80\x9d and the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the burden on First Amendment rights.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Given \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutionality, the burden imposed by the \xc2\xa7319(b) requirements cannot be justified.

See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a(a)(3)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295.

When a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA to pass the $350,000 mark (for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cself-financing\xe2\x80\x9d), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the limitations noted above, but the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent (the \xe2\x80\x9cnon-self-financing\xe2\x80\x9d candidate) may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit <em>(e.g.,</em> $6,900 rather than the current $2,300), even from individuals who have reached the normal aggregate contributions cap, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C).  Once the non-self-financing candidate\xe2\x80\x99s receipts exceed the OPFA, the prior limits are revived.  \xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a)(3).

Section 319(b) thus requires self-financing candidates to make three types of disclosures.  First, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must file a \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eclaration of intent\xe2\x80\x9d revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000.  2 U.

Within 24 hours after receiving an \xe2\x80\x9cinitial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadditional\xe2\x80\x9d notification filed by a self-financing opponent, a non-self-financing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and the national and state committees of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party if the non-self-financing candidate concludes based on the newly acquired information that the OPFA has passed the $350,000 mark.  11 CFR \xc2\xa7400.30(b)(2).  In addition, when the additional contributions that a non-self-financing candidate is authorized to receive pursuant to the asymmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the non-self-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the appropriate national and state committees within 24 hours.  \xc2\xa7400.31(e)(1)(ii).

In both elections, he lost to the incumbent.  In his brief, Davis discloses having spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004 campaign.  Brief for Appellant 4.  He reports spending $2.3 million in 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.  His opponent in 2006 spent no personal funds.  Indeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the opportunity for Davis\xe2\x80\x99 opponent to raise nearly $1.5 million under \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical limits, Davis\xe2\x80\x99 opponent adhered to the normal contribution limits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis\xe2\x80\x99 2006 candidacy began in March 2006, when he filed with the FEC a \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of Candidacy\xe2\x80\x9d and, in compliance with \xc2\xa7319(b), declared that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds during the general election.  Two months later, in anticipation of this expenditure and its \xc2\xa7319 consequences, Davis filed suit against the FEC, requesting that \xc2\xa7319 be declared unconstitutional and that the FEC be enjoined from enforcing it during the 2006 election.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Davis declared his candidacy but before he filed suit, the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel notified him that it had reason to believe that he had violated \xc2\xa7319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign.  The FEC proposed a conciliation agreement under which Davis would pay a substantial civil penalty.  Davis responded by agreeing to toll the limitations period for an FEC enforcement action until resolution of this suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel was convened.  BCRA \xc2\xa7403, 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437h.  While Davis requested that the case be decided before the general election campaign began on September 12, 2006, the FEC opposed the request, asserting the need for extensive discovery, and the request was denied.

To qualify for standing, a claimant must present an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s challenged behavior; and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.  <em>Lujan, supra,</em> at 560\xe2\x80\x93561.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court held, and the parties do not dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge the disclosure requirements of \xc2\xa7319(b).  When Davis filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by \xc2\xa7319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds.  At that time, Davis faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications after he in fact passed the $350,000 mark.  Securing a declaration that \xc2\xa7319(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are unconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures.  That relief also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged violations of \xc2\xa7319(b) during his 2004 campaign.  As a result, Davis possesses standing to challenge \xc2\xa7319(b)\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that Davis has standing to challenge \xc2\xa7319(b) does not necessarily mean that he also has standing to challenge the scheme of contribution limitations that applies when \xc2\xa7319(a) comes into play.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U.

When Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not yet qualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his opponent did qualify to take advantage of those limits, he chose not to do so.  Accordingly, the FEC argues that \xc2\xa7319(a) did not cause Davis any injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the proof required to establish standing increases as the suit proceeds, see <em>Lujan, supra,</em> at 561, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.  <em>Friends of Earth</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 180; <em>Arizonans for Official English</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 68, n. 22.  As noted above, the injury required for standing need not be actualized.  A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct.  <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U.

Davis faced such an injury from the operation of \xc2\xa7319(a) when he filed suit.  Davis had declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity.  Indeed, the record at summary judgment indicated that most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded contributions had done so.  App. 89.  In these circumstances, we conclude that Davis faced the requisite injury from \xc2\xa7319(a) when he filed suit and has standing to challenge that provision\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical contribution scheme.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC\xe2\x80\x99s mootness argument also fails.  This case closely resembles <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em>, 551 U. S. ___ (2007).  There, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological advocacy corporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30 days of the 2004 Washington primary, contrary to a restriction imposed by BCRA.  WRTL sued the FEC, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  Although the suit was not resolved before the 2004 election, we rejected the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s claim of mootness, finding that the case \xe2\x80\x9cfit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  That \xe2\x80\x9cexception applies where \xe2\x80\x98(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/1/index.html">523 U.

Similarly, in this case despite BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to expedite and Davis\xe2\x80\x99 request that his case be resolved before the 2004 general election season commenced, Davis\xe2\x80\x99 case could not be resolved before the 2006 election concluded, demonstrating that his claims are capable of evading review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second prong of the exception, even though WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit capable of repetition where \xe2\x80\x9cWRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running \xe2\x80\x98materially similar\xe2\x80\x99 future\xe2\x80\x9d ads subject to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition and had, in fact, sought an injunction that would permit such an ad during the 2006 election.  551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (some internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the FEC conceded in its brief that  Davis\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat.  Brief for Appellee 14, 20\xe2\x80\x9321, and n.\xc2\xa05.  Davis subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so.  See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democrat Davis Confirms He\xe2\x80\x99ll Run Again for Congress, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Mar. 27, 2008, p.\xc2\xa05B).  As a result, we are satisfied that Davis\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge is not moot.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the merits of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the First Amendment is violated by the contribution limits that apply when \xc2\xa7319(a) comes into play.  Under this scheme, as previously noted, when a candidate spends more than $350,000 in personal funds and creates what the statute apparently regards as a financial imbalance, that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent may qualify to receive both larger individual contributions than would otherwise be allowed and unlimited coordinated party expenditures.  Davis contends that \xc2\xa7319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of his First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 own speech.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If \xc2\xa7319(a) simply raised the contribution limits for all candidates, Davis\xe2\x80\x99 argument would plainly fail.  This Court has previously sustained the facial constitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual contributions and on coordinated party expenditures.  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U.

At the same time, the Court has recognized that such limits implicate First Amendment interests and that they cannot stand unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to serve a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important interest,\xe2\x80\x9d such as preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.

When contribution limits are challenged as too restrictive, we have extended a measure of deference to the judgment of the legislative body that enacted the law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Randall</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/230/index.html">548 U.

Congress has no constitutional obligation to limit contributions at all; and if Congress concludes that allowing contributions of a certain amount does not create an undue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a candidate who wishes to restrict an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising cannot argue that the Constitution demands that contributions be regulated more strictly.  Consequently, if \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s elevated contribution limits applied across the board, Davis would not have any basis for challenging those limits.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 319(a), however, does not raise the contribution limits across the board.  Rather, it raises the limits only for the non-self-financing candidate and does so only when the self-financing candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded.  We have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other, and we agree with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Buckley</em>, we soundly rejected a cap on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech.  We held that a \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate \xe2\x80\xa6 has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election\xe2\x80\x9d and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t]\xe2\x80\x9d restraint on that right.  424 U.

We found that the cap at issue was not justified by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he primary governmental interest\xe2\x80\x9d proffered in its defense,<em> i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 53.  Far from preventing these evils, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of personal funds,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9creduces the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which \xe2\x80\xa6 contribution limitations are directed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>We also rejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified on the ground that it served \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Id.,</em> at 54.  This putative interest, we noted, was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly not sufficient to justify the \xe2\x80\xa6 infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is instructive.  While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right.  Section 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  Many candidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to support their campaigns may choose to do so despite \xc2\xa7319(a), but they must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice.  See <em>Day </em>v.<em> Holahan</em>, 34 F.\xc2\xa03d 1356, 1359\xe2\x80\x931360 (CA8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota law that increased a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits and eligibility for public funds based on independent expenditures against her candidacy burdened the speech of those making the independent expenditures); Brief for Appellee 29 (conceding that \xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa7]319 does impose some consequences on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s choice to self-finance beyond certain amounts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under \xc2\xa7319(a), the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics.  Cf. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/1/index.html">475 U.

In <em>Buckley</em>, we held that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmay engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations\xe2\x80\x9d even though we found an independent limit on overall campaign expenditures to be unconstitutional.  424 U. S., at 57, n. 65; see <em>id.,</em> at 54\xe2\x80\x9358.  But the choice involved in <em>Buckley</em> was quite different from the choice imposed by \xc2\xa7319(a).  In <em>Buckley, </em>a candidate, by forgoing public financing, could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited personal expenditures.  Here, \xc2\xa7319(a) does not provide any way in which a candidate can exercise that right without abridgment.  Instead, a candidate who wishes to exercise that right has two choices: abide by a limit on personal expenditures or endure the burden that is placed on that right by the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits.  The choice imposed by \xc2\xa7319(a) is not remotely parallel to that in <em>Buckley</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7319(a) imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech, that provision cannot stand unless it is \xe2\x80\x9cjustified by a compelling state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html">479 U.

Similarly, given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that liberalized limits for non-self-financing candidates do not unduly imperil anticorruption interests, it is hard to imagine how the denial of liberalized limits to self-financing candidates can be regarded as serving anticorruption goals sufficiently to justify the resulting constitutional burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government maintains that  \xc2\xa7319(a)\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical  limits are justified because they \xe2\x80\x9clevel electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellee 34.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted Section 319,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government writes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce <em>the natural advantage </em>that wealthy individuals possess in campaigns for federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 33 (emphasis added).

S., at 791, n.\xc2\xa031 (The \xe2\x80\x9c[g]overnment is forbidden to assume the task of ultimate\njudgment, lest the people lose their ability to govern\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government contends that \xc2\xa7319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects that result from the tight limits that federal election law places on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures.  These limits, it is argued, make it harder for candidates who are not wealthy to raise funds and therefore provide a substantial advantage for wealthy candidates.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa7319(a) can be seen, not as a legislative effort to interfere with the natural operation of the electoral process, but as a legislative effort to mitigate the untoward consequences of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 own handiwork and restore \xe2\x80\x9cthe normal relationship between a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s financial resources and the level of popular support for his candidacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellee 33.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever the merits of this argument as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with the analysis of expenditure and contributions limits that this Court adopted in <em>Buckley</em> and has applied in subsequent cases.  The advantage that wealthy candidates now enjoy and that \xc2\xa7319(a) seeks to reduce is an advantage that flows directly from <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s disparate treatment of expenditures and contributions.  If that approach is sound\xe2\x80\x94and the Government does not urge us to hold otherwise[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]\xe2\x80\x94it is hard to see how undoing the consequences of that decision can be viewed as a compelling interest.  If the normally applicable limits on individual contributions and coordinated party contributions are seriously distorting the electoral process, if they are feeding a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic perception that wealthy people can buy seats in Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Appellee 34, and if those limits are not needed in order to combat corruption, then the obvious remedy is to raise or eliminate those limits.  But the unprecedented step of imposing different contribution and coordinated party expenditure limits on candidates vying for the same seat is antithetical to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remaining issue that we must consider is the  constitutionality of \xc2\xa7319(b)\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931 (2006 ed.), is the product of a congressional judgment that candidates who are willing and able to spend over $350,000 of their own money in seeking election to Congress enjoy an advantage over opponents who must rely on contributions to finance their campaigns.  To reduce that advantage, and to combat the perception that congressional seats are for sale to the highest bidder, Congress has relaxed the restrictions that would otherwise limit the amount of contributions that the opponents of self-funding candidates may accept from their supporters.  In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the District Court held that because the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment does not impose any burden whatsoever on the self-funding candidate\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to speak, it does not violate the First Amendment, and because it does no more than diminish the unequal strength of the self-funding candidate, it does not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  I agree completely with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, specifically its adherence to our decision in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

While I would affirm for the reasons given by the District Court, I believe it appropriate to add these additional comments on the premise that underlies the constitutional prohibition on expenditure limitations, and on my reasons for concluding that the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment represents a modest, sensible, and plainly constitutional attempt by Congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates vis-\xc3\x80-vis those who must rely on the support of others to fund their pursuit of public office.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U.

S. 230</a>, 274, 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, a number of purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign.  For one, such limitations would \xe2\x80\x9cfree candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html">518 U. S. 604</a>, 649 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Moreover, the imposition of reasonable limitations would likely have the salutary effect of improving the quality of the exposition of ideas.  After all, orderly debate is always more enlightening than a shouting match that awards points on the basis of decibels rather than reasons.  Quantity limitations are commonplace in any number of other contexts in which high-value speech occurs.  Litigants in this Court pressing issues of the utmost importance to the Nation are allowed only a fixed time for oral debate and a maximum number of pages for written argument.  As listeners and as readers, judges need time to reflect on the merits of an issue; repetitious arguments are disfavored and are usually especially unpersuasive.  Indeed, experts in the art of advocacy agree that \xe2\x80\x9clawyers go on for too long, and when they do it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help their case.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It seems to me that Congress is entitled to make the judgment that voters deserve the same courtesy and the same opportunity to reflect as judges; flooding the airwaves with slogans and sound-bites may well do more to obscure the issues than to enlighten listeners.  At least in the context of elections, the notion that rules limiting the quantity of speech are just as offensive to the First Amendment as rules limiting the content of speech is plainly incorrect.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, as I have come to believe, Congress could attempt to reduce the millionaire candidate\xe2\x80\x99s advantage by imposing reasonable limits on <em>all</em> candidates\xe2\x80\x99 expenditures, it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the eminently reasonable scheme before us today survives constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even accepting the <em>Buckley </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that expenditure limits as such are uniquely incompatible with the First Amendment, it remains my firm conviction that the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment represents a good-faith attempt by Congress to regulate, within the bounds of the Constitution, one particularly pernicious feature of many contemporary political campaigns.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It cannot be gainsaid that the twin rationales at the heart of the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment\xe2\x80\x94reducing the importance of wealth as a criterion for public office and countering the perception that seats in the United States Congress are available for purchase by the wealthiest bidder\xe2\x80\x94are important Government interests.  It is also evident that Congress, in enacting the provision, crafted a solution that was carefully tailored to those concerns.  Davis insists, however, that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests are insufficiently weighty to justify what he believes are intrusions upon his rights under the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and that, regardless of the strength of the justifications offered, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 solution is not sufficiently tailored to addressing the twin concerns it has identified.  His arguments are unpersuasive on all counts.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The thrust of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment challenge is that by relaxing the contribution limits applicable to the opponent of a self-funding candidate, the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment punishes the candidate who chooses to self-fund.  Extrapolating from the zero-sum nature of a political race, Davis insists that any benefit conferred upon a self-funder\xe2\x80\x99s opponent thereby works a detriment to the self-funding candidate.  Accordingly, he argues, the scheme burdens the self-funding candidate\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment right to speak freely and to participate fully in the political process.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Davis cannot show that the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment causes him\xe2\x80\x94or any other self-funding candidate\xe2\x80\x94any First Amendment injury whatsoever.  The Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment quiets no speech at all.  On the contrary, it does no more than assist the opponent of a self-funding candidate in his attempts to make his voice heard; this amplification in no way mutes the voice of the millionaire, who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign.  Enhancing the speech of the millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, far from contravening the First Amendment, actually advances its core principles.  If only one candidate can make himself heard, the voter\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make an informed choice is impaired.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And the self-funding candidate\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage meaningfully in the political process is in no way undermined by this provision.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even were we to credit Davis\xe2\x80\x99 view that the benefit conferred on the self-funding candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent burdens the self-funder\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment rights, the purposes of the Amendment surely justify its effects.  The Court is simply wrong when it suggests that the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 14, is the sole governmental interest sufficient to support campaign finance regulations.  See <em>ante,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  It is true, of course, that in upholding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971\xe2\x80\x99s (FECA) limits on the size of contributions to political campaigns, the <em>Buckley </em>Court held that preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption were Government interests of sufficient weight that they justified any infringement upon First Amendment freedoms that resulted from FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits; the Court explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. \xe2\x80\xa6 Of almost equal concern \xe2\x80\xa6 is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  It is also true that the Court found that same interest insufficient to justify FECA\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limitations.  <em>Id., </em>at 45\xe2\x80\x9346, 52\xe2\x80\x9356.  But it does not follow that the <em>Buckley </em>Court concluded that <em>only</em> the interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption can justify congressional regulation of campaign financing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, we have long recognized the strength of an independent governmental interest in reducing both the influence of wealth on the outcomes of elections, and the appearance that wealth alone dictates those results.  In case after case, we have held that statutes designed to protect against the undue influence of aggregations of wealth on the political process\xe2\x80\x94where such statutes are responsive to the identified evil\xe2\x80\x94do not contravene the First Amendment.  See,<em> e.g., Austin </em>v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, 660 (1990) (upholding statute designed to combat \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html">479 U. S. 238</a>, 257 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cTh[e] concern over the corrosive influence of concentrated corporate wealth reflects the conviction that it is important to protect the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas. \xe2\x80\xa6 Direct corporate spending on political activity raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d); cf.<em> Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/index.html">395 U. S. 367</a>, 390 (1969) (upholding constitutionality of several components of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfair coverage\xe2\x80\x9d requirements, and explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the focus of our cases has been on aggregations of corporate rather than individual wealth, there is no reason that their logic\xe2\x80\x94specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process\xe2\x80\x94is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth.  For, as we explained in <em>McConnell</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 historical concern with the \xe2\x80\x98political potentialities of wealth\xe2\x80\x99 and their \xe2\x80\x98untoward consequences for the democratic process\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6 has long reached beyond corporate money,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U. S., at 116 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/567/index.html">352 U. S. 567</a>, 577\xe2\x80\x93578 (1957)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Minimizing the effect of concentrated wealth on our political process, and the concomitant interest in addressing the dangers that attend the perception that political power can be purchased, are, therefore, sufficiently weighty objectives to justify significant congressional action.  And, not only was Congress motivated by proper and weighty goals in crafting the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment, the details of the scheme it devised are genuinely responsive to the problems it identified.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOpposition Personal Funds Amount\xe2\x80\x9d formula permits a self-funding candidate to spend as much money as he wishes, while taking into account fundraising by the relevant campaigns; it thereby ensures that a candidate who happens to enjoy a significant fundraising advantage against a self-funding opponent does not reap a windfall as a result of the enhanced contribution limits.  Rather, the self-funder\xe2\x80\x99s opponent may avail himself of the enhanced contribution limits only until parity is achieved, at which point he becomes again ineligible for contributions above the normal maximum.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems uncontroversial that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no good reason to allow disparities in wealth to be translated into disparities in political power.  A well-functioning democracy distinguishes between market processes of purchase and sale on the one hand and political processes of voting and reason-giving on the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sunstein, Political Equality and Unintended Consequences, 94 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1390 (1994).  In light of that clear truth, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 carefully crafted attempt to reduce the distinct advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates for congressional office does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection argument, which the Court finds unnecessary to address, <em>ante, </em>at 18, n. 9, fares no better.  He claims that by permitting only the self-funder\xe2\x80\x99s opponent to avail himself of the increased contribution limits, the statute creates an unwarranted disparity between the self-funder and his opponent.  But, as we explained in <em>McConnell,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is fully entitled to consider \xe2\x80\xa6 real-world differences \xe2\x80\xa6 when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 188.  And <em>Buckley </em>itself acknowledged, in the course of upholding FECA\xe2\x80\x99s public financing scheme, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>424 U. S., at 97.  It blinks reality to contend that the millionaire candidate is situated identically to a nonmillionaire opponent, and Congress was under no obligation to indulge any such fiction.  Accordingly, Davis has failed to establish that he was deprived of the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I share Judge Wright\xe2\x80\x99s view that nothing in the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cprevents us, as a political community, from making certain modest but important changes in the kind of process we want for selecting our political leaders,\xe2\x80\x9d Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech? 85 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1001, 1005 (1976).

I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The <em>Buckley </em>Court invalidated two different types of limits on campaign expenditures: limits on the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal or family resources\xe2\x80\x9d a candidate could spend on his own campaign, 424 U.
