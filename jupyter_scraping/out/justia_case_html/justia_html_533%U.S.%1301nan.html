Justice Powell stayed a District Court order dissolving a preliminary injunction in <i>Wallace </i>when the plaintiffs there alleged that teachers led their classes in prayer daily. Here, by contrast, after more than a year in operation, the minute of silence seems to have meant just that.

This application to me followed.</p><p>I note first that applicants are seeking not merely a stay of a lower court judgment, but an injunction against the enforcement of a presumptively valid state statute. The All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1651(a), is the only source of this Court\'s authority to issue such an injunction. It is established, and our own rules require, that injunctive relief under the All Writs Act is to be used "\'sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances.\'" <i>Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. </i>v. <i>NRC, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/1312/case.html">479 U. S. 1312</a>, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers) (quoting <i>Fishman </i>v. <i>Schaffer, </i>429 U. S. 1325, 1326 (1976) (Marshall, J., in chambers)). Such an injunction is appropriate only if "the legal rights at issue are \'indisputably clear.\'" 479 U. S., at 1313 (quoting <i>Communist Party of Ind. </i>v. <i>Whitcomb, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/1235/case.html">409 U. S. 1235</a> (1972) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers)).</p><p>Whatever else may be said about the issues and equities in this case, the rights of the applicants are not "indisputably clear." The pros and cons of the applicants\' claim on the merits are fully set forth in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Court of Appeals. Applicants contend that this case is virtually a replay of <i>Wallace </i>v. <i>Jaffree, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/case.html">472 U. S. 38</a> (1985), in which we struck down a similar Alabama statute. But the majority opinion in the Court of Appeals took pains to distinguish the present case from <i>Wallace. </i>It noted our statement that the statute at issue there was "\'quite different from [a statute] merely protecting every student\'s right to engage in voluntary prayer during an appropriate moment of silence during the schoolday.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 59, as quoted in 258 F. 3d, at 279. It further found ample evidence that \xc2\xa7 22.1-203 had a clear secular purpose, namely, to provide a moment for quiet reflection in the wake of high-profile instances of violence in our public schools. <i>Id., </i>at 276-277. This alone may distinguish <i>Wallace, </i>in which Alabama ex-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1304">1304</a></p><p>Opinion in Chambers</p><p>plicitly conceded that the sole purpose of its moment of silence law was to return prayer to the Alabama schools. We in fact emphasized in <i>Wallace </i>that the Alabama statute "had <i>no </i>secular purpose." 472 U. S., at 56 (emphasis in original). At the very least the lower court\'s finding of a clear secular purpose in this case casts some doubt on the question whether \xc2\xa7 22.1-203 establishes religion in violation of the First Amendment. See, <i>e. </i>g., id., at 66 (Powell, J., concurring) ("[A] straightforward moment-of-silence statute is unlikely to \'advance or inhibit religion\' "); id., at 73 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) ("Even if a statute specifies that a student may choose to pray silently during a quiet moment, the State has not thereby encouraged prayer over other specified alternatives").</p><p>Without expressing any view of my own, or attempting to predict the views of my colleagues as to the ultimate merit of applicants\' First Amendment claim, I can say with some confidence that their position is less than indisputable.</p><p>Applicants point out that Justice Powell stayed the order of the District Court dissolving a preliminary injunction in <i>Wallace. </i>See <i>Jaffree </i>v. <i>Board of School Comm\'rs of Mobile </i>Cty., <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/1314/case.html">459 U. S. 1314</a> (1983) (opinion in chambers). But there the plaintiffs alleged that "teachers had \'on a daily basis\' led their classes in saying certain prayers in unison." <i>Wallace, supra, </i>at 42. Here, by contrast, after more than a year of operation, the Virginia statute providing for a minute of silence seems to have meant just that. There is no allegation that Virginia schoolteachers have used the minute of silence, or any other occasion, to lead students in collective prayer. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals noted that between 1976 and 2000 at least 20 local school divisions in Virginia established a minute of silence in their classrooms, yet there is no evidence of the practice having ever been used as a government prayer exercise.</p><p>I also note that applicants could have made an immediate application to a Justice of this Court under 28 U. S. C.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1305">1305</a></p><p>\xc2\xa7 1651(a) in September 2000, after the Court of Appeals denied their request for an injunction pending appeal. That they did not do so is somewhat inconsistent with the urgency they now assert.</p><p>For these reasons, I decline to issue an injunction pending certiorari in this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
