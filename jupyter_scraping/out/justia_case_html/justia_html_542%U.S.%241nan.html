Argued April 20, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 21, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">In 1964, pursuant to a recommendation by the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission), and as part of an endeavor to improve judicial assistance between the United States and foreign countries, Congress completely revised 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(a).  In its current form, \xc2\xa71782(a) provides that a federal district court \xe2\x80\x9cmay order\xe2\x80\x9d a person residing or found in the district to give testimony or produce documents \xe2\x80\x9cfor use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal \xe2\x80\xa6 upon the application of any interested person.\xe2\x80\x9d  The 1964 overhaul of \xc2\xa71782(a) deleted the prior law\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cin any judicial proceeding <em>pending </em>in any court in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with the Directorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) of the Commission of the European Communities (Commission), alleging that Intel had violated European competition law.  After the DG-Competition declined AMD\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to seek documents Intel had produced in a private antitrust suit in an Alabama federal court, AMD petitioned the District Court for the Northern District of California under \xc2\xa71782(a) for an order directing Intel to produce those documents.  The District Court concluded that \xc2\xa71782(a) did not authorize such discovery.  The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to rule on the application\xe2\x80\x99s merits.  The appeals court observed that \xc2\xa71782(a) includes matters before bodies of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature, and, since 1964, has contained no limitation to foreign proceedings that are \xe2\x80\x9cpending.\xe2\x80\x9d  A proceeding judicial in character, the Ninth Circuit noted, was a likely sequel to the Commission investigation.  The Court of Appeals rejected Intel\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa71782(a) called for a threshold showing that the documents AMD sought, if located in the European Union, would have been discoverable in the Commission investigation.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language or legislative history, the Ninth Circuit said, required a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign-discoverability\xe2\x80\x9d rule of that order.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, the District Court to provide discovery aid to AMD.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0To provide context, the Court summarizes how the Commission, acting through the DG-Competition, enforces European competition laws.  Upon receiving a complaint, or <em>sU. S.onte,</em> the DG-Competition conducts a preliminary investigation into alleged violations of those laws.  The DG-Competition may consider information provided by a complainant, and it may seek information from a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s target.  The DG-Competition\xe2\x80\x99s investigation results in a formal written decision whether to pursue the complaint.  If the DG-Competition decides not to proceed, its decision may be reviewed by the Court of First Instance and, ultimately, the Court of Justice for the European Communities (European Court of Justice).  When the DG-Competition pursues a complaint, it typically serves the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s target with a formal \xe2\x80\x9cstatement of objections\xe2\x80\x9d and advises the target of its intention to recommend a decision finding an antitrust violation.  The target is entitled to a hearing before an independent officer, who provides a report to the DG-Competition.  Once the DG-Competition makes its recommendation, the Commission may dismiss the complaint or issue a decision holding the target liable and imposing penalties.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s final action is subject to review in the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice.  Lacking formal \xe2\x80\x9clitigant\xe2\x80\x9d status in Commission proceedings, a complainant nonetheless has significant procedural rights.  Important here, a complainant may submit relevant information to the DG-Competition and seek judicial review of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s disposition.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Section 1782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language, confirmed by its context, warrants the conclusion that the provision authorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a Commission proceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling.  The Court therefore rejects the categorical limitations Intel would place on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A complainant before the Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  The Court rejects Intel\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person[s]\xe2\x80\x9d does not include complainants, but encompasses only litigants, foreign sovereigns, and a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s designated agents.  To support its reading, Intel highlights \xc2\xa71782\xe2\x80\x99s caption, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ssistance to foreign and international tribunals and to <em>litigants</em> before such tribunals\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  A statute\xe2\x80\x99s caption, however, cannot undo or limit its text\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  <em>Trainmen</em> v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/519/index.html">331 U. S. 519</a>, 529.  Section 1782(a) plainly reaches beyond the universe of persons designated \xe2\x80\x9clitigant.\xe2\x80\x9d  With significant participation rights in Commission proceedings, the complainant qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person\xe2\x80\x9d within any fair construction of that term.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The assistance AMD seeks meets \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s specification \xe2\x80\x9cfor use in a foreign or international tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Commission qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker.  Both the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice are tribunals, but not proof-takers.  Their review is limited to the record before the Commission.  Hence, AMD could \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d evidence in those reviewing courts only by submitting it to the Commission in the current, investigative stage.  In adopting the Rules Commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommended replacement of the term \xe2\x80\x9cany judicial proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d with the words \xe2\x80\x9ca proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress opened the way for judicial assistance in foreign administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.  This Court has no warrant to exclude the Commission, to the extent that it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker, from \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d for which discovery is sought under \xc2\xa71782(a) must be within reasonable contemplation, but need not be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimminent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court rejects Intel\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Commission <em>investigation</em> launched by AMD\xe2\x80\x99s complaint does not qualify for \xc2\xa71782(a) assistance.  Since the 1964 revision, which deleted the prior law\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cpending,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress has not limited judicial assistance under \xc2\xa71782(a) to \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d adjudicative proceedings.  This Court presumes that Congress intends its statutory amendments to have real and substantial effect.  <em>Stone</em> v. <em>INS,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/386/index.html">514 U. S. 386</a>, 397.  The 1964 revision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history corroborates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition that judicial assistance would be available for both foreign proceedings and <em>investigations.</em>  A 1996 amendment clarifies that \xc2\xa71782(a) covers \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in that amendment, however, suggests that Congress meant to rein in, rather than to confirm, by way of example, the range of discovery \xc2\xa71782(a) authorizes.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Section 1782(a) does not impose a foreign-discoverability requirement.  Although \xc2\xa71782(a) expressly shields from discovery matters protected by legally applicable privileges, nothing in \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text limits a district court\xe2\x80\x99s production-order authority to materials discoverable in the foreign jurisdiction if located there.  Nor does the legislative history suggest that Congress intended to impose a blanket foreign-discoverability rule on \xc2\xa71782(a) assistance.  The Court rejects two policy concerns raised by Intel in support of a foreign-discoverability limitation on \xc2\xa71782(a) aid\xe2\x80\x94avoiding offense to foreign governments, and maintaining parity between litigants.  While comity and parity concerns may be legitimate touchstones for a district court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion in particular cases, they do not warrant construction of \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text to include a generally applicable<em> </em>foreign-discoverability rule.  Moreover, the Court questions whether foreign governments would be offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but not requiring, judicial assistance.  A foreign nation may limit discovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its own legal practices, culture, or traditions; such reasons do not necessarily signal objection to aid from United States federal courts.  A foreign tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to order production of materials present in the United States similarly may signal no resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to \xc2\xa71782(a). When the foreign tribunal would readily accept relevant information discovered in the United States, application of a categorical foreign-discoverability rule would be senseless.  Concerns about parity among adversaries in litigation likewise provide no sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule.  When information is sought by an \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person,\xe2\x80\x9d a district court can condition relief upon reciprocal information exchange.  Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on its acceptance of information, thereby maintaining whatever measure of parity it deems appropriate.  The Court also rejects Intel\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that a \xc2\xa71782(a) applicant must show that United States law would allow discovery in domestic litigation analogous to the foreign proceeding.  Section 1782 is a provision for assistance to tribunals abroad.  It does not direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.  Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.  For example, the United States has no close analogue to the Commission regime, under which AMD lacks party status and can participate only as a complainant.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Whether \xc2\xa71782(a) assistance is appropriate in this case is yet unresolved.  To guide the District Court on remand, the Court notes factors relevant to that question.  First, when the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding, as Intel is here, the need for \xc2\xa71782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad.  A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.  In contrast, nonparticipants in foreign proceedings may be outside the foreign tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional reach; thus, their evidence, available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent \xc2\xa71782(a) aid.  Second, a court presented with a \xc2\xa71782(a) request may consider the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government, court, or agency to federal-court judicial assistance.  Further, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s scope may be relevant in determining whether a discovery order should be granted in a particular case.  Specifically, a district court could consider whether the \xc2\xa71782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering limits or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.  Also, unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed.  The Court declines, at this juncture, Intel\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that it exercise its supervisory authority to adopt rules barring \xc2\xa71782(a) discovery here.  Any such endeavor should await further experience with \xc2\xa71782(a) applications in the lower courts.  Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.  While Intel and its <em>amici</em> are concerned that granting AMD\xe2\x80\x99s application in any part may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage \xe2\x80\x9cfishing expeditions,\xe2\x80\x9d and undermine the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s program offering prosecutorial leniency for admissions of wrongdoing, no one has suggested that AMD\xe2\x80\x99s complaint to the Commission is pretextual.  Nor has it been shown that \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s preservation of legally applicable privileges and the controls on discovery available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2) and (c) would be ineffective to prevent discovery of Intel\xe2\x80\x99s confidential information.  The Court leaves it to the courts below, applying closer scrutiny, to assure an airing adequate to determine what, if any, assistance is appropriate.

In the matter before us, respondent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with the Directorate-General for Competition of the Commission of the European Communities (European Commission or Commission).  In pursuit of that complaint, AMD applied to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, invoking 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(a), for an order requiring Intel to produce potentially relevant documents.  Section 1782(a) provides that a federal district court \xe2\x80\x9cmay order\xe2\x80\x9d a person \xe2\x80\x9cresid[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfound\xe2\x80\x9d in the district to give testimony or produce documents \xe2\x80\x9cfor use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal \xe2\x80\xa6 upon the application of any interested person.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concluding that \xc2\xa71782(a) did not authorize the requested discovery, the District Court denied AMD\xe2\x80\x99s application.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that determination and remanded the case, instructing the District Court to rule on the merits of AMD\xe2\x80\x99s application.  In accord with the Court of Appeals, we hold that the District Court had authority under \xc2\xa71782(a) to entertain AMD\xe2\x80\x99s discovery request.  The statute, we rule, does not categorically bar the assistance AMD seeks: (1) A complainant before the European Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s compass; (2) the Commission is a \xc2\xa71782(a) \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker; (3) the \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d for which discovery is sought under \xc2\xa71782(a) must be in reasonable contemplation, but need not be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d; and (4) \xc2\xa71782(a) contains no threshold requirement that evidence sought from a federal district court would be discoverable under the law governing the foreign proceeding.  We caution, however, that \xc2\xa71782(a) authorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide judicial assistance to foreign or international tribunals or to \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in proceedings abroad.  Whether such assistance is appropriate in this case is a question yet unresolved.  To guide the District Court on remand, we suggest considerations relevant to the disposition of that question.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1782 is the product of congressional efforts, over the span of nearly 150 years, to provide federal-court assistance in gathering evidence for use in foreign tribunals.  Congress first provided for federal-court aid to foreign tribunals in 1855; requests for aid took the form of letters rogatory forwarded through diplomatic channels.  See Act of Mar. 2, 1855, ch. 140, \xc2\xa72, 10 Stat. 630 (circuit court may appoint \xe2\x80\x9ca United States commissioner designated \xe2\x80\xa6 to make the examination of witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d on receipt of a letter rogatory from a foreign court); Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 95, \xc2\xa71, 12 Stat. 769 (authorizing district courts to respond to letters rogatory by compelling witnesses here to provide testimony for use abroad in \xe2\x80\x9csuit[s] for the recovery of money or property\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1948, Congress substantially broadened the scope of assistance federal courts could provide for foreign proceedings.  That legislation, codified as \xc2\xa71782, eliminated the prior requirement that the government of a foreign country be a party or have an interest in the proceeding.  The measure allowed district courts to designate persons to preside at depositions \xe2\x80\x9cto be used in <em>any civil action </em>pending in any court in a foreign country with which the United States is at peace.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, \xc2\xa71782, 62 Stat. 949 (emphasis added).  The next year, Congress deleted \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d from \xc2\xa71782\xe2\x80\x99s text and inserted \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, \xc2\xa793, 63 Stat. 103.  See generally, Jones, International Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform, 62 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 515 (1953).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1958, prompted by the growth of international commerce, Congress created a Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission) to \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigate and study existing practices of judicial assistance and cooperation between the United States and foreign countries with a view to achieving improvements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Sept. 2, Pub.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1015\xe2\x80\x931016 (1965) (hereinafter Smit, International Litigation).  Six years later, in 1964, Congress unanimously adopted legislation recommended by the Rules Commission;[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the legislation included a complete revision of \xc2\xa71782.  See Act of Oct. 3, Pub. L. 88\xe2\x80\x93619, \xc2\xa79, 78 Stat. 997; Smit, International Litigation 1026\xe2\x80\x931035.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As recast in 1964, \xc2\xa71782 provided for assistance in obtaining documentary and other tangible evidence as well as testimony.  Notably, Congress deleted the words \xe2\x80\x9cin any judicial proceeding <em>pending </em>in any court in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d and replaced them with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6, 4a\xe2\x80\x935a (emphasis added).  While the accompanying Senate Report does not account discretely for the deletion of the word \xe2\x80\x9cpending,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] it explains that Congress introduced the word \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cassistance is not confined to proceedings before conventional courts,\xe2\x80\x9d but extends also to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

A foreign nation may limit discovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its own legal practices, culture, or traditions\xe2\x80\x94reasons that do not necessarily signal objection to aid from United States federal courts.  See <em>Bayer</em>, 146 F. 3d, at 194 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no reason to assume that because a country has not adopted a particular discovery procedure, it would take offense at its use.\xe2\x80\x9d); Smit, Recent Developments in International Litigation, 35 S.

The rule in that situation would serve only to thwart \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s objective to assist foreign tribunals in obtaining relevant information that the tribunals may find useful but, for reasons having no bearing on international comity, they cannot obtain under their own laws.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concerns about maintaining parity among adversaries in litigation likewise do not provide a sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule.

Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f AMD were pursuing this matter in the United States, U.

It does not direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.  Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  For example, we have in the United States no close analogue to the European Commission regime under which AMD is not free to mount its own case in the Court of First Instance or the European Court of Justice, but can participate only as complainant, an \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person,\xe2\x80\x9d in Commission-steered proceedings.

See <em>United Kingdom</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 238 F.\xc2\xa03d 1312, 1319 (CA11 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9ca district court\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with a \xc2\xa71782 request is not mandatory\xe2\x80\x9d).  We note below factors that bear consideration in ruling on a \xc2\xa71782(a) request.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, when the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding (as Intel is here), the need for \xc2\xa71782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad.  A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.  App. to Reply Brief 4a (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen th[e] person [who is to produce the evidence] is a party to the foreign proceedings, the foreign or international tribunal can exercise its own jurisdiction to order production of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Decl. of H. Smit in <em>In\xc2\xa0re: Application of Ishihara Chemical Co., Ltd., For order to take discovery of Shipley Company, L.L.C., Pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782,</em> Misc. 99\xe2\x80\x93232 (FB) (EDNY, May 18, 2000)).  In contrast, nonparticipants in the foreign proceeding may be outside the foreign tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional reach; hence, their evidence, available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent \xc2\xa71782(a) aid.  See App. to Reply Brief 4a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, as the 1964 Senate Report suggests, a court presented with a \xc2\xa71782(a) request may take into account the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency abroad to U. S. federal-court judicial assistance.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1580, at 7.  Further, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s scope may be relevant in determining whether a discovery order should be granted in a particular case.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23.  Specifically, a district court could consider whether the \xc2\xa71782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 27.  Also, unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed.  See <em>Bayer</em>, 146 F. 3d, at 196 (remanding for district-court consideration of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate measures, if needed, to protect the confidentiality of materials\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Application of Esses</em>, 101 F.\xc2\xa03d 873, 876 (CA2 1996) (affirming limited discovery that is neither \xe2\x80\x9cburdensome [n]or duplicative\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Intel maintains that, if we do not accept the categorical limitations it proposes, then, at least, we should exercise our supervisory authority to adopt rules barring \xc2\xa71782(a) discovery here.  Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9336; cf. <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Arn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/140/index.html">474 U. S. 140</a>, 146\xe2\x80\x93147 (1985) (this Court can establish rules of \xe2\x80\x9csound judicial practice\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We decline, at this juncture, to adopt supervisory rules.  Any such endeavor at least should await further experience with \xc2\xa71782(a) applications in the lower courts.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The European Commission has stated in <em>amicus curiae</em> briefs to this Court that it does not need or want the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.  See European Commission <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9316; Brief for European Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in Support of Pet. for Cert. 4\xe2\x80\x938.  It is not altogether clear, however, whether the Commission, which may itself invoke \xc2\xa71782(a) aid, means to say \xe2\x80\x9cnever\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chardly ever\xe2\x80\x9d to judicial assistance from United States courts.  Nor do we know whether the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views on \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s utility are widely shared in the international community by entities with similarly blended adjudicative and prosecutorial functions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.  Intel and its <em>amici</em> have expressed concerns that AMD\xe2\x80\x99s application, if granted in any part, may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage \xe2\x80\x9cfishing expeditions,\xe2\x80\x9d and undermine the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Leniency Program.  See Brief for Petitioner 37; European Commission <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9316.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Yet no one has suggested that AMD\xe2\x80\x99s complaint to the Commission is pretextual.  Nor has it been shown that \xc2\xa71782(a)\xe2\x80\x99s preservation of legally applicable privileges, see <em>supra</em>, at 16, and the controls on discovery available to the District Court, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2) and (c), would be ineffective to prevent discovery of Intel\xe2\x80\x99s business secrets and other confidential information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the merits, this case bears closer scrutiny than it has received to date.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782 to extend beyond what I believe Congress might reasonably have intended.  Some countries allow a private citizen to ask a court to review a criminal prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to prosecute.  On the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, that foreign private citizen could ask an American court to help the citizen obtain information, even if the foreign prosecutor were indifferent or unreceptive.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Mann, Criminal Procedure, in Introduction to the Law of Israel 278 (A. Shapira &amp; K. DeWitt-Arar eds. 1995).  Many countries allow court review of decisions made by any of a wide variety of nonprosecutorial, nonadjudicative bodies.  On the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, a British developer, hoping to persuade the British Housing Corporation to grant it funding to build a low-income housing development, could ask an American court to demand that an American firm produce information designed to help the developer obtain the British grant.  Cf., <em>e.g., </em>Mayer, The Housing Corporation: Multiple Lines of Accountability, in Quangos, Accountability and Reform: The Politics of Quasi-Government 111, 114 (M. Flinders &amp; M. Smith eds. 1999).  This case itself suggests that an American firm, hoping to obtain information from a competitor, might file an antitrust complaint with the European antitrust authorities, thereby opening up the possibility of broad American discovery\xe2\x80\x94contrary to the antitrust authorities\xe2\x80\x99 desires.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One might ask why it is wrong to read the statute as permitting the use of America\xe2\x80\x99s court processes to obtain information in such circumstances.  One might also ask why American courts should not deal <em>case by case</em> with any problems of the sort mentioned.  The answer to both of these questions is that discovery and discovery-related judicial proceedings take time, they are expensive, and cost and delay, or threats of cost and delay, can themselves force parties to settle underlying disputes.  See The Brookings Institution, Justice For All: Reducing Costs and Delay in Civil Litigation, Report of a Task Force 6\xe2\x80\x937 (1989) (lawyers surveyed estimated that 60% of litigation costs in a typical federal case are attributable to discovery and agreed that high litigation costs are often attributable to abuse of the discovery process); Federal Judicial Center, T. Willging, J. Shapard, D. Stienstra, &amp; D. Milfich, Discovery and Disclosure Practice, Problems, and Proposals for Change 1\xe2\x80\x932, 4, 8, 14\xe2\x80\x9316 (Tables 3\xe2\x80\x935) (1997) (study outlining costs of discovery).  To the extent that expensive, time-consuming battles about discovery proliferate, they deflect the attention of foreign authorities from other matters those authorities consider more important; they can lead to results contrary to those that foreign authorities desire; and they can promote disharmony among national and international authorities, rather than the harmony that \xc2\xa71782 seeks to achieve.  They also use up domestic judicial resources and crowd our dockets.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why I believe the statute, while granting district courts broad authority to order discovery, nonetheless must be read as subject to some categorical limits, at least at the outer bounds\xe2\x80\x94a matter that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision makes even more important.  Those limits should rule out instances in which it is virtually certain that discovery (if considered case by case) would prove unjustified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case does not require us to find a comprehensive set of limits.  But it does suggest two categorical limitations, which I would adopt.  First, when a foreign entity possesses few tribunal-like characteristics, so that the applicability of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d is in serious doubt, then a court should pay close attention to the foreign entity\xe2\x80\x99s own view of its \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d-like or non-\xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d-like status.  By paying particular attention to the views of the very foreign nations that Congress sought to help, courts would better achieve Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic cooperative objectives in enacting the statute.  See Act of Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85\xe2\x80\x93906, \xc2\xa72, 72 Stat. 1743 (creating Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure to investigate and improve judicial \xe2\x80\x9ccooperation\xe2\x80\x9d between the United States and other countries).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concept of paying special attention to administrative views is well established in American law.  Cf. <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984); <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140 (1944).  Like American administrators, foreign administrators are likely to understand better than American courts their own job and, for example, how discovery rights might affect their ability to carry out their responsibilities.  I can think of no reason why Congress would have intended a court to pay <em>less </em>attention to the foreign entity\xe2\x80\x99s view of the matter than courts ordinarily pay to a domestic agency\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the workings of its own statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, a court should not permit discovery where both of the following are true: (1) A private person seeking discovery would not be entitled to that discovery under foreign law, <em>and </em>(2) the discovery would not be available under domestic law in analogous circumstances.  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for example, make only limited provisions for nonlitigants to obtain certain discovery.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa027.  The limitations contained in the Rules help to avoid discovery battles launched by firms simply seeking information from competitors.  Where there is benefit in permitting such discovery, and the benefit outweighs the cost of allowing it, one would expect either domestic law or foreign law to authorize it.  If, notwithstanding the fact that it would not be allowed under either domestic or foreign law, there is some special need for the discovery in a particular instance, one would expect to find foreign governmental or intergovernmental authorities making the case for that need.  Where <em>none </em>of these circumstances is present, what benefit could offset the obvious costs to the competitor and to our courts?  I cannot think of any.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of either of these limiting principles would require dismissal of this discovery proceeding.  First, the Commission of the European Communities\xe2\x80\x99 (Commission) antitrust authority\xe2\x80\x99s status as a \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d is questionable.  In many respects, the Commission more closely resembles a prosecuting authority, say, the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Antitrust Division, than an administrative agency that adjudicates cases, say, the Federal Trade Commission.  To my knowledge, those who decide whether to bring an antitrust prosecution on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s behalf are not judges.  See App. 96; Wils, The Combination of the Investigative and Prosecutorial Function and the Adjudicative Function in EC Antitrust Enforcement: A Legal and Economic Analysis, 27 World Competition Law and Economics Review 201, 207 (June 2004) (explaining, in an article written by a member of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Service, that \xe2\x80\x9cin European Commission proceedings there is no independent initial adjudicator . . . and the Commissioners do not sit as judges hearing directly both sides of the case\xe2\x80\x9d).  They do not adjudicate adversary proceedings on the basis of proofs and argument.  <em>Id., </em>at 207.  Nor, as the majority appears to recognize, does the later availability of a reviewing court matter where \xe2\x80\x9creview is limited to the record before the Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAMD could \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 evidence in the reviewing courts only by submitting it to the Commission in the current, investigative stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 13.  At a minimum, then, the question whether the Commission is a \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d is unclear.  See Wils, <em>supra, </em>at 207\xe2\x80\x93209 (noting the scholarly and legal debate as to whether the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s antitrust investigation and enforcement activities qualify it as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98independent and impartial tribunal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Commission has told this Court that it is not a \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  It has added that, should it be considered, against its will, a \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal,\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cability to carry out its governmental responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d will be seriously threatened.  Brief for Commission of the European Communities as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2.  Given the potential need for the Commission to respond when a private firm (including an American company) files a complaint with the Commission and seeks discovery in an American court (say, from a competitor), its concerns are understandable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of its own functions is, in my view, entitled to deference.  The majority disregards the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and states categorically that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commission is a \xc2\xa71782(a) \xe2\x80\x98tribunal\xe2\x80\x99 when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 2.  In so ignoring the Commission, the majority undermines the comity interests \xc2\xa71782 was designed to serve and disregards the maxim that we construe statutes so as to \xe2\x80\x9chel[p] the potentially conflicting laws of different nations work together in harmony\xe2\x80\x94a harmony particularly needed in today\xe2\x80\x99s highly interdependent commercial world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>F.\xc2\xa0Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. </em>v. <em>Empagran S.\xc2\xa0A., ante,</em> at __ (slip op., at 8).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second limiting factor is also present.  Neither AMD nor any comparable private party would be able to obtain the kind of discovery AMD seeks, either in Europe or in the United States.  In respect to Europe, the Commission has told us that any person in the world is free to file a complaint with the Commission, but it is the Commission that then investigates.  The private complainant lacks any authority to obtain discovery of business secrets and commercial information.  See Brief for Commission of the European Communities as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13, and n.\xc2\xa015.  In respect to the United States, AMD is a nonlitigant, apart from this discovery proceeding.  Conditions under which a nonlitigant may obtain discovery are limited.  AMD does not suggest that it meets those conditions, or that it is comparable in any other way to one who might obtain discovery under roughly analogous circumstances.  In addition, the material it seeks is under a protective order.  See <em>ante, </em>at 6, n. 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is the legal source of these limiting principles?  In my view, they, and perhaps others, are implicit in the statute itself, given its purpose and use of the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctribunal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinterested person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71782(a).  But even if they are not, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory powers . . . permit, at the least, the promulgation of procedural rules governing the management of litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d not to mention \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98procedures deemed desirable from the viewpoint of sound judicial practice although in nowise commanded by statute or by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Arn, </em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/140/index.html">474 U.
