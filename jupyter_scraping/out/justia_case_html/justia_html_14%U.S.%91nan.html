CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p>The proceedings of the Court therefore is arrested <em>in limine</em> by a question respecting its jurisdiction.  In the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/445/case.html">Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey,</a></span></em> 2 Cranch 445, this Court determined on mature consideration that a citizen of the District of Columbia could not maintain a suit in the circuit court of the United States.  That opinion is still retained.</p>\n<p>It has been attempted to distinguish a territory from the District of Columbia, but the Court is of opinion that this distinction cannot be maintained.  They may differ in many respects, but neither of them is a state in the sense in which that term is used in the Constitution.  Every reason assigned for the opinion of the Court that a citizen of Columbia was not capable of suing in the courts of the United States under the Judiciary Act is equally applicable to a citizen of a territory.  Gabriel Winter, then, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 14 U. S. 95</a></p><p> being a citizen of the Mississippi Territory, was incapable of maintaining a suit alone in the Circuit Court of Louisiana.  Is his case mended by being associated with others who are capable of suing in that court?  In the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/7/267/case.html">Strawbridge v. Curtiss,</a></span></em> 3 Cranch 267, it was decided that where a joint interest is prosecuted, the jurisdiction cannot be sustained unless each individual be entitled to claim that jurisdiction.  In this case it has been doubted, whether the parties might elect to sue jointly or severally.  However this may be, having elected to sue jointly, the Court is incapable of distinguishing their case, so far as respects jurisdiction, from one in which they were compelled to unite.  The Circuit Court of Louisiana therefore had no jurisdiction of the cause, and its judgment must on that account be reversed and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
