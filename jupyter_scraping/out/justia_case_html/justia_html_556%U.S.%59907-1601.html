In 1960, Brown &amp; Bryant, Inc. (B&amp;B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a parcel of land located in Arvin, California.  B&amp;B later expanded onto an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company (Railroads).  As part of its business, B&amp;B purchased and stored various hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D\xe2\x80\x93D, which it bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell).  Over time, many of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a result of equipment failures.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Investigations of B&amp;B by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamination and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA authority to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action against Shell and the Railroads.  The District Court ruled in favor of the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially responsible parties under CERCLA\xe2\x80\x94the Railroads because they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had \xe2\x80\x9carranged for disposal \xe2\x80\xa6 of hazardous substances,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79607(a)(3), through D\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x99s sale and delivery.  The District Court apportioned liability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments\xe2\x80\x99 total response costs, and Shell liable for 6%.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in that respect.  Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Governments\xe2\x80\x99 response costs.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the Arvin facility.  Section \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond the limits of the statute itself.  Because CERCLA does not specifically define what it means to \xe2\x80\x9carrang[e] for\xe2\x80\x9d disposal of a hazardous substance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning.  In common parlance, \xe2\x80\x9carrange\xe2\x80\x9d implies action directed to a specific purpose.  Thus, under \xc2\xa79607(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, an entity may qualify as an arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.  To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into D\xe2\x80\x93D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of \xc2\xa76903(3)\xe2\x80\x99s methods.  The facts found by the District Court do not support such a conclusion.  The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during D\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x99s transfer from the common carrier to B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s storage tanks after the product had come under B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to reduce </em>the likelihood of spills.  Thus, Shell\xe2\x80\x99s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient grounds for concluding that it \xe2\x80\x9carranged for\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 share of the site remediation costs at 9%.  Calculating liability based on three figures\xe2\x80\x94the percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s business divided by the term of the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 lease, and the court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that only two polluting chemicals (not D\xe2\x80\x93D) spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination\xe2\x80\x94the District Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for 9% of the remediation costs.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed findings show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the facility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous-chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, some of which did not require remediation.  Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&amp;B site, where most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring remediation.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79601\xe2\x80\x939675, in response to the serious environmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/51/index.html">524 U. S. 51</a>, 55 (1998).  The Act was designed to promote the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.  <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y. </em>v.<em> UGI Util., Inc.</em>, 423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005); see also <em>Meghrig</em> v. <em>KFC Western, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/479/index.html">516 U.

These cases raise the questions whether and to what extent a party associated with a contaminated site may be held responsible for the full costs of remediation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1960, Brown &amp; Bryant, Inc. (B&amp;B), began operating an agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing pesticides and other chemical products from suppliers such as Shell Oil Company (Shell).  Using its own equipment, B&amp;B applied its products to customers\xe2\x80\x99 farms.  B&amp;B opened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farmland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded operations onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now known respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company) (Railroads).  Both parcels of the Arvin facility were graded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the southeast corner of the primary parcel.  See Appendix, <em>infra</em>.  Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined until 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from the facility to seep into the ground water below.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During its years of operation, B&amp;B stored and distributed various hazardous chemicals on its property.  Among these were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals, and the pesticides D\xe2\x80\x93D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.  Dinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon containers on a concrete slab outside B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s warehouse.  Nemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon containers inside the warehouse.  Originally, B&amp;B purchased D\xe2\x80\x93D in 55-gallon drums; beginning in the mid-1960\xe2\x80\x99s, however, Shell began requiring its distributors to maintain bulk storage facilities for D\xe2\x80\x93D.  From that time onward, B&amp;B purchased D\xe2\x80\x93D in bulk.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When B&amp;B purchased D\xe2\x80\x93D, Shell would arrange for delivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  When the product arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a bulk storage tank located on B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s primary parcel.  From there, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks, nurse tanks, and pull rigs.  During each of these transfers leaks and spills could\xe2\x80\x94and often did\xe2\x80\x94occur.  Although the common carrier and B&amp;B used buckets to catch spills from hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its bulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or were knocked over, causing D\xe2\x80\x93D to spill onto the ground during the transfer process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aware that spills of D\xe2\x80\x93D were commonplace among its distributors, in the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s Shell took several steps to encourage the safe handling of its products.  Shell provided distributors with detailed safety manuals and instituted a voluntary discount program for distributors that made improvements in their bulk handling and safety facilities.  Later, Shell revised its program to require distributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer and provide self-certification of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s Arvin facility was inspected twice, and in 1981, B&amp;B certified to Shell that it had made a number of recommended improvements to its facilities.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these improvements, B&amp;B remained a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]loppy\xe2\x80\x99 [o]perator.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931601, p. 130a.  Over the course of B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s 28 years of operation, delivery spills, equipment failures, and the rinsing of tanks and trucks allowed Nemagon, D\xe2\x80\x93D and dinoseb to seep into the soil and upper levels of ground water of the Arvin facility.  In 1983, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s violation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed suit, discovering significant contamination of soil and ground water.  Of particular concern was a plume of contaminated ground water located under the facility that threatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential drinking water.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although B&amp;B undertook some efforts at remediation, by 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.  That same year, the Arvin facility was added to the National Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subsequently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their authority under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79604 to undertake cleanup efforts at the site.  By 1998, the Governments had spent more than $8 million responding to the site contamination; their costs have continued to accrue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the Railroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the property on which the Arvin facility was located, to perform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.  The Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3 million in the process.  Seeking to recover at least a portion of their response costs, in 1992 the Railroads brought suit against B&amp;B in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.  In 1996, that lawsuit was consolidated with two recovery actions brought by DTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in 1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of the Governments.  In a lengthy order supported by 507 separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court held that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA\xe2\x80\x94the Railroads because they were owners of a portion of the facility, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79607(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), and Shell because it had \xe2\x80\x9carranged for\xe2\x80\x9d the disposal of hazardous substances through its sale and delivery of D\xe2\x80\x93D, see \xc2\xa79607(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the court found the parties liable, it did not impose joint and several liability on Shell and the Railroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Governments.  The court found that the site contamination created a single harm but concluded that the harm was divisible and therefore capable of apportionment.  Based on three figures\xe2\x80\x94the percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s business divided by the term of the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 lease, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that only two of three polluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those two chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination requiring remediation\xe2\x80\x94the court apportioned the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 liability as 9% of the Governments\xe2\x80\x99 total response cost.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell products, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site response cost.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governments appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of liability.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d arranger under \xc2\xa79607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&amp;B to directly dispose of a hazardous waste product.  520 F.\xc2\xa03d 918, 948 (CA9 2008).  Nevertheless, the court stated that Shell could still be held liable under a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98broader\xe2\x80\x99 category of arranger liability\xe2\x80\x9d if the \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal of hazardous wastes [wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of, the transaction giving rise to\xe2\x80\x9d arranger liability.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Relying on CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal,\xe2\x80\x9d which covers acts such as \xe2\x80\x9cleaking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspilling,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could arrange for \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceven if it did not intend to dispose\xe2\x80\x9d of a hazardous substance.  520 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 949.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance through its sale and delivery of D\xe2\x80\x93D:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cShell arranged for delivery of the substances to the site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and provided advice and supervision concerning safe transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous substance was thus a necessary part of the sale and delivery process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 950.</p>\n<p align="left">\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger liability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of Shell\xe2\x80\x99s action had been to transport a useful and previously unused product to B&amp;B for sale.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals found \xe2\x80\x9cno dispute\xe2\x80\x9d on the question whether the harm caused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of apportionment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 942.  The court observed that a portion of the site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel became part of the facility, only some of the hazardous substances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and \xe2\x80\x9conly some of the water on the facility washed over the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 site.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  With respect to Shell, the court noted that not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the facility had been sold by Shell.<em> </em> Given those facts, the court readily concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe contamination traceable to the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information, would be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that contamination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in finding that the record established a reasonable basis for apportionment.  Because the burden of proof on the question of apportionment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment of liability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Governments\xe2\x80\x99 cost of responding to the contamination of the Arvin facility.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc, which the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of eight judges.  See <em>id.</em>, at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting).  We granted certiorari to determine whether Shell was properly held liable as an entity that had \xe2\x80\x9carranged for disposal\xe2\x80\x9d of hazardous substances within the meaning of \xc2\xa79607(a)(3), and whether Shell and the Railroads were properly held liable for all response costs incurred by EPA and the State of California.  See 554 U. S. ___ (2008).  Finding error on both points, we now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\nCERCLA imposes strict liability for environmental contamination upon four broad classes of PRPs:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility, </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82any person<font super="1">[[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]] who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, </font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3)\xe2\x80\x82any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(4)\xe2\x80\x82any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79607(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nOnce an entity is identified as a PRP, it may be compelled to clean up a contaminated area or reimburse the Government for its past and future response costs.  See <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U. S. 157</a>, 161 (2004).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these cases, it is undisputed that the Railroads qualify as PRPs under both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79607(a)(1) and 9607(a)(2) because they owned the land leased by B&amp;B at the time of the contamination and continue to own it now.  The more difficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP under \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances surrounding its sales to B&amp;B.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an arranger, we begin with the language of the statute.  As relevant here, \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) applies to an entity that \xe2\x80\x9carrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is plain from the language of the statute that CERCLA liability would attach under \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) if an entity were to enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discarding a used and no longer useful hazardous substance.  It is similarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an arranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the purchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the seller, disposed of the product in a way that led to contamination.  See <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome, Inc.</em>, 189 F.\xc2\xa03d 160, 164 (CA2 1999); <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</em> v. <em>Allis Chalmers Corp.</em>, 893 F. 2d 1313, 1318 (CA11 1990).  Less clear is the liability attaching to the many permutations of \xe2\x80\x9carrangements\xe2\x80\x9d that fall between these two extremes\xe2\x80\x94cases in which the seller has some knowledge of the buyers\xe2\x80\x99 planned disposal or whose motives for the \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d of a hazardous substance are less than clear.  In such cases, courts have concluded that the determination whether an entity is an arranger requires a fact-intensive inquiry that looks beyond the parties\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the transaction as a \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9csale\xe2\x80\x9d and seeks to discern whether the arrangement was one Congress intended to fall within the scope of CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s strict-liability provisions.

See <em>Cello-Foil Prods., Inc.</em>, 100 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1231 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be error for us not to recognize the indispensable role that state of mind must play in determining whether a party has \xe2\x80\x98otherwise arranged for disposal \xe2\x80\xa6 of hazardous substances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governments do not deny that the statute requires an entity to \xe2\x80\x9carrang[e] for\xe2\x80\x9d disposal; however, they interpret that phrase by reference to the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Act broadly defines as \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76903(3); see also \xc2\xa79601(29) (adopting the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdisposal\xe2\x80\x9d contained in the Solid Waste Disposal Act).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Governments assert that by including unintentional acts such as \xe2\x80\x9cspilling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleaking\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of disposal, Congress intended to impose liability on entities not only when they directly dispose of waste products but also when they engage in legitimate sales of hazardous substances[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] knowing that some disposal may occur as a collateral consequence of the sale itself.  Applying that reading of the statute, the Governments contend that Shell arranged for the disposal of D\xe2\x80\x93D within the meaning of \xc2\xa79607(a)(3) by shipping D\xe2\x80\x93D to B&amp;B under conditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion of the hazardous substance by the purchaser or common carrier.  See Brief for United States 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the delivery of a useful product was the ultimate <em>purpose</em> of the arrangement, Shell\xe2\x80\x99s continued participation in the delivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would result, was sufficient to establish Shell\xe2\x80\x99s intent to dispose of hazardous substances\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because these spills resulted in wasted D\xe2\x80\x93D, a result Shell anticipated, the Governments insist that Shell was properly found to have arranged for the disposal of D\xe2\x80\x93D.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While it is true that in some instances an entity\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or otherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s intent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone is insufficient to prove that an entity \xe2\x80\x9cplanned for\xe2\x80\x9d the disposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a peripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful product.  In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into the sale of D\xe2\x80\x93D with the intention that at least a portion of the product be disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of the methods described in \xc2\xa76903(3).  Here, the facts found by the District Court do not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during the transfer of D\xe2\x80\x93D from the common carrier to B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at the Arvin facility and had come under B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship, the evidence does not support an inference that Shell intended such spills to occur.  To the contrary, the evidence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to <em>reduce </em>the likelihood of such spills, providing them with detailed safety manuals, requiring them to maintain adequate storage facilities, and providing discounts for those that took safety precautions.  Although Shell\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were less than wholly successful, given these facts, Shell\xe2\x80\x99s mere knowledge that spills and leaks continued to occur is insufficient grounds for concluding that Shell \xe2\x80\x9carranged for\xe2\x80\x9d the disposal of D\xe2\x80\x93D within the meaning of \xc2\xa79607(a)(3).  Accordingly, we conclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the contamination that occurred at B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s Arvin facility. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger, we need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment of Shell\xe2\x80\x99s liability for the cost of remediation.

After reviewing CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s history, Chief Judge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a \xe2\x80\x9cstrict liability standard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 805, it did not mandate \xe2\x80\x9cjoint and several\xe2\x80\x9d liability in every case.  See <em>id.</em>, at 807.  Rather, Congress intended the scope of liability to \xe2\x80\x9cbe determined from traditional and evolving principles of common law[.]\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 808.  The <em>Chem-Dyne</em> approach has been fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc.</em>, 3 F. 3d 889, 901\xe2\x80\x93902 (CA5 1993); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alcan Aluminum Corp.</em>, 964 F. 2d 252, 268 (CA3 1992); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neil</em> v. <em>Picillo</em>, 883 F. 2d 176, 178 (CA1 1989); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Monsanto Co.</em>, 858 F. 2d 160, 171\xe2\x80\x93173 (CA4 1988).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following <em>Chem-Dyne</em>, the courts of appeals have acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he universal starting point for divisibility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases\xe2\x80\x9d is \xc2\xa7433A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hercules, Inc.</em>, 247 F. 3d 706, 717 (CA8 2001); <em>Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 292 F. 3d 254, 259 (CADC 2002); <em>United States</em> v. <em>R.

Under the Restatement,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwhen two or more persons acting independently caus[e] a distinct or single harm for which there is a reasonable basis for division according to the contribution of each, each is subject to liability only for the portion of the total harm that he has himself caused.

See <em>Chem-Dyne Corp.</em>, 572 F. Supp., at 810 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7433B (1976)) (placing burden of proof on party seeking apportionment).  When two or more causes produce a single, indivisible harm, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts have refused to make an arbitrary apportionment for its own sake, and each of the causes is charged with responsibility for the entire harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7433A, Comment <em>i</em>, p. 440 (1963\xe2\x80\x931964). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the parties nor the lower courts dispute the principles that govern apportionment in CERCLA cases, and both the District Court and Court of Appeals agreed that the harm created by the contamination of the Arvin site, although singular, was theoretically capable of apportionment.  The question then is whether the record provided a reasonable basis for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm caused by contamination at the Arvin facility. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scorched earth,\xe2\x80\x99 all-or-nothing approach to liability,\xe2\x80\x9d failing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of hazardous substances that occurred on their parcel throughout the 13-year period of B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s lease.  According to the District Court, the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 position on liability, combined with the Governments\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to acknowledge the potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the apportioning of liability.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931601, at 236a\xe2\x80\x93237a (\xe2\x80\x9cAll parties \xe2\x80\xa6 effectively abdicated providing any helpful arguments to the court and have left the court to independently perform the equitable apportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of the case\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet despite the parties\xe2\x80\x99 failure to assist the court in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to the proper allocation of liability, the District Court ultimately concluded that this was \xe2\x80\x9ca classic \xe2\x80\x98divisible in terms of degree\xe2\x80\x99 case, both as to the time period in which defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and as to the estimated maximum contribution of each party\xe2\x80\x99s activities that released hazardous substances that caused Site contamination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 239a.  Consequently, the District Court apportioned liability, assigning the Railroads 9% of the total remediation costs. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court calculated the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 liability based on three figures.  First, the court noted that the Railroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of the Arvin site.  Second, the court observed that the Railroads had leased their parcel to B&amp;B for 13 years, which was only 45% of the time B&amp;B operated the Arvin facility.  Finally, the court found that the volume of hazardous-substance-releasing activities on the B&amp;B property was at least 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on the Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of two chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D\xe2\x80\x93D), substantially contributed to the contamination that had originated on the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had contributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination requiring remediation.  The court then multiplied .19 by .45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that the Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of the remediation costs.  \xe2\x80\x9cAllowing for calculation errors up to 50%,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that the Railroads could be held responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost for the Arvin site.  <em>Id.</em>, at 252a. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions rested, finding a lack of sufficient data to establish the precise proportion of contamination that occurred on the relative portions of the Arvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years prior to B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s addition of the Railroad parcel.  The court noted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of the leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm caused by activities on the property owned by the Railroads, and\xe2\x80\x94as the court\xe2\x80\x99s upward adjustment confirmed\xe2\x80\x94the court had relied on estimates rather than specific and detailed records as a basis for its conclusions. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts contained in the record reasonably supported the apportionment of liability.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed findings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution at the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump and an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the facility most distant from the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 parcel and that the spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, see <em>id.</em>, at 247a\xe2\x80\x93248a, some of which did not require remediation.  With those background facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was reasonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel and the duration of the lease as the starting point for its analysis.  Although the Court of Appeals faulted the District Court for relying on the \xe2\x80\x9csimplest of considerations: percentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of hazardous products,\xe2\x80\x9d 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the same factors the court had earlier acknowledged were <em>relevant</em> to the apportionment analysis.  See <em>id.</em>, at 936, n.18 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe of course agree with our sister circuits that, if adequate information is available, divisibility may be established by \xe2\x80\x98volumetric, chronological, or other types of evidence,\xe2\x80\x99 including appropriate geographic considerations\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were responsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills requiring remediation, observing that each PRP\xe2\x80\x99s share of the total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of pollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total facility.  Although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of those spills that occurred, not all were carried across the Railroad parcel to the B&amp;B sump and pond from which most of the contamination originated.  The fact that no D\xe2\x80\x93D spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends strength to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Railroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in quantities requiring remediation. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that those two chemicals accounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requiring remediation finds less support in the record; however, any miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate allocation of liability, which included a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction in liability the District Court provided based on its assessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.  Had the District Court limited its apportionment calculations to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use and the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it would have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response cost.  By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for the Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% \xe2\x80\x9cmargin of error,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court reached the same result.  Because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate allocation of liability is supported by the evidence and comports with the apportionment principles outlined above, we reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the Railroads are subject to joint and several liability for all response costs arising out of the contamination of the Arvin facility.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred by holding Shell liable as an arranger under CERCLA for the costs of remediating environmental contamination at the Arvin, California facility.  Furthermore, we conclude that the District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\xe2\x80\x99 share of the site remediation costs\nat 9%.

See generally <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hercules, Inc.</em>, 247 F. 3d 706, 718\xe2\x80\x93719 (CA8 2001); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brighton</em>, 153 F. 3d 307, 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (CA6 1998); <em>Redwing Carriers, Inc.</em> v. <em>Saraland Apartments</em>, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11 1996).  As the Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pportionment . . . looks to whether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establishing a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,\xe2\x80\x9d while contribution actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each other on the basis of equitable considerations.  520 F.\xc2\xa03d 918, 939\xe2\x80\x93940 (CA9 2008); see also 42 U.

The error is of no consequence, however, because despite the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to equity, its actual apportionment decision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable basis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Railroads. </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962904">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nGINSBURG, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBURLINGTON N. &amp; S.&amp;NBSP;F.&amp;NBSP;R.

Later, Shell found it economically advantageous, in lieu of shipping in drums, to require B&amp;B to maintain bulk storage facilities for receipt of the chemicals B&amp;B purchased from Shell.  <em>Id.,</em> at 115a.  By the mid-1960\xe2\x80\x99s, Shell was delivering its chemical to B&amp;B in bulk tank truckloads.  <em>Id.,</em> at 89a, 115a.  As the Court recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9cbulk storage of the chemical led to numerous tank failures and spills as the chemical rusted tanks and eroded valves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, n.\xc2\xa01.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shell furthermore specified the equipment to be used in transferring the chemicals from the delivery truck to B&amp;B\xe2\x80\x99s storage tanks.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931601, pp. 120a\xe2\x80\x93122a, 124a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In the process, spills and leaks were inevitable, indeed spills occurred every time deliveries were made.  520 F.\xc2\xa03d 918, 950\xe2\x80\x93951 (CA9 2008).  See also App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931601, pp. 119a\xe2\x80\x93122a (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undisputed that spills were inherent in the delivery process that Shell arranged \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That Shell sold B&amp;B useful products, the Ninth Circuit observed, did not exonerate Shell from CERCLA liability, for the sales \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily and immediately result[ed] in the leakage of hazardous substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  520 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 950.  The deliveries, Shell was well aware, directly and routinely resulted in disposals of hazardous substances (through spills and leaks) for more than 20 years.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]ere knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d may not be enough, <em>ante</em>, at 13, but Shell did not simply know of the spills and leaks without contributing to them.  Given the control rein held by Shell over the mode of delivery and transfer, 520 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 950\xe2\x80\x93951, the lower courts held and I agree, Shell was properly ranked an arranger.  Relieving Shell of any obligation to pay for the cleanup undertaken by the United States and California is hardly commanded by CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s text, and is surely at odds with CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s objective\xe2\x80\x94to place the cost of remediation on persons whose activities contributed to the contamination rather than on the taxpaying public.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to apportioning costs, the District Court undertook an heroic labor.  The Railroads and Shell, the court noted, had pursued a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scorched earth,\xe2\x80\x99 all-or-nothing approach to liability.  Neither acknowledged an iota of responsibility \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Neither party offered helpful arguments to apportion liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x931601, p. 236a, \xc2\xb6455.  Consequently, the court strived \xe2\x80\x9cindependently [to] perform [an] equitable apportionment analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 237a, \xc2\xb6455.  Given the party presentation principle basic to our procedural system, <em>Greenlaw</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5), it is questionable whether the court should have pursued the matter <em>sua sponte</em>.  See <em>Castro</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/375/index.html">540 U. S. 375</a>, 386 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d).
