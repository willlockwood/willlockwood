S. 726</a>.  Having first defined the prohibited speech in 1975, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took a cautious, but gradually expanding, approach to enforcing the statutory prohibition.  In 2004, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Golden Globes Order</em> declared for the first time that an expletive (nonliteral) use of the F-Word or the S-Word could be actionably indecent, even when the word is used only once.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns isolated utterances of the F- and S-Words during two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television Stations, Inc.  In its order upholding the indecency findings, the FCC, <em>inter alia,</em> stated that the <em>Golden Globes Order </em>eliminated any doubt that fleeting expletives could be actionable; declared that under the new policy, a lack of repetition weighs against a finding of indecency, but is not a safe harbor; and held that both broadcasts met the new test because one involved a literal description of excrement and both invoked the F-Word.  The order did not impose sanctions for either broadcast.  The Second Circuit set aside the agency action, declining to address the constitutionality of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s action but finding the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).    </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">489 F.\xc2\xa03d 444, reversed and remanded. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III\xe2\x80\x93E, concluding:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s orders are neither \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9ccapricious\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.

Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/29/index.html">463 U. S. 29</a>, 43.  In overturning the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, the Second Circuit relied in part on its precedent interpreting the APA and <em>State Farm </em>to require a more substantial explanation for agency action that changes prior policy.  There is, however, no basis in the Act or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions for a requirement that all agency change be subjected to more searching review.  Although an agency must ordinarily display awareness that it <em>is </em>changing position, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/index.html">418 U. S. 683</a>, 696, and may sometimes need to account for prior factfinding or certain reliance interests created by a prior policy, it need not demonstrate to a court\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are <em>better</em> than the reasons for the old one.  It suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency <em>believes </em>it to be better, which the conscious change adequately indicates.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under these standards, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s new policy and its order finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  First, the FCC forthrightly acknowledged that its recent actions have broken new ground, taking account of inconsistent prior FCC and staff actions, and explicitly disavowing them as no longer good law.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for expanding its enforcement activity, moreover, were entirely rational.  Even when used as an expletive, the F-Word\xe2\x80\x99s power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning.  And the decision to look at the patent offensiveness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with <em>Pacifica</em>\xe2\x80\x99s context-based approach.  Because the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s prior safe-harbor-for-single-words approach would likely lead to more widespread use, and in light of technological advances reducing the costs of bleeping offending words, it was rational for the agency to step away from its old regime.  The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to impose sanctions precludes any argument that it is arbitrarily punishing parties without notice of their actions\xe2\x80\x99 potential consequences.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0None of the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s grounds for finding the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s action arbitrary and capricious is valid.  First, the FCC did not need empirical evidence proving that fleeting expletives constitute harmful \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blows\xe2\x80\x9d to children; it suffices to know that children mimic behavior they observe.  Second, the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 finding that fidelity to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow\xe2\x80\x9d theory would require a categorical ban on <em>all </em>broadcasts of expletives is not responsive to the actual policy under review since the FCC has always evaluated the patent offensiveness of words and statements in relation to the context in which they were broadcast.  The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to retain some discretion in less egregious cases does not invalidate its regulation of the broadcasts under review.  Third, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that a <em>per se</em> exemption for fleeting expletives would lead to their increased use merits deference and makes entire sense.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Fox\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments are not tenable grounds for affirmance.  Fox misconstrues the agency\xe2\x80\x99s orders when it argues that that the new policy is a presumption of indecency for certain words.  It reads more into <em>Pacifica</em> than is there by arguing that the FCC failed adequately to explain how this regulation is consistent with that case.  And Fox\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s repeated appeal to \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d is a smokescreen for a standardless regime of unbridled discretion ignores the fact that the opinion in <em>Pacifica</em> endorsed a context-based approach.

At that time, the Commission announced the definition of indecent speech that it uses to this day, prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9clanguage that describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 98.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Pacifica Foundation</em>, <em>supra</em>, we upheld the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order against statutory and constitutional challenge.  We rejected the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the statutory proscription applied only to speech appealing to the prurient interest, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe normal definition of \xe2\x80\x98indecent\xe2\x80\x99 merely refers to nonconformance with accepted standards of morality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 740.  And we held that the First Amendment allowed Carlin\xe2\x80\x99s monologue to be banned in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely pervasive presence\xe2\x80\x9d of the medium and the fact that broadcast programming is \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely accessible to children.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 748\xe2\x80\x93749.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the ensuing years, the Commission took a cautious, but gradually expanding, approach to enforcing the statutory prohibition against indecent broadcasts.

The first order to this effect dealt with an NBC broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, in which the performer Bono commented, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98This is really, really, f***ing brilliant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Globe Awards\xe2\x80\x9d Program, </em>19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4976, n.\xc2\xa04 (2004) <em>(Golden Globes Order)</em>.<em> </em>Although the Commission had received numerous complaints directed at the broadcast, its enforcement bureau had concluded that the material was not indecent because \xe2\x80\x9cBono did not describe, in context, sexual or excretory organs or activities and \xe2\x80\xa6 the utterance was fleeting and isolated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 4975\xe2\x80\x934976, \xc2\xb63.

The Commission determined, moreover, that the broadcast was \xe2\x80\x9cpatently offensive\xe2\x80\x9d because the F-Word \xe2\x80\x9cis one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the English language,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ts use invariably invokes a coarse sexual image,\xe2\x80\x9d and because Bono\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word was entirely \xe2\x80\x9cshocking and gratuitous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4979, \xc2\xb69.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission observed that categorically exempting such language from enforcement actions would \xe2\x80\x9clikely lead to more widespread use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Commission action was necessary to \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard the well-being of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s children from the most objectionable, most offensive language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The order noted that technological advances have made it far easier to delete (\xe2\x80\x9cbleep out\xe2\x80\x9d) a \xe2\x80\x9csingle and gratuitous use of a vulgar expletive,\xe2\x80\x9d without adulterating the content of a broadcast.  <em>Id.</em>, at 4980, \xc2\xb611.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cprior Commission and staff action have indicated that isolated or fleeting broadcasts of the \xe2\x80\x98F-Word\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 are not indecent or would not be acted upon.\xe2\x80\x9d  It explicitly ruled that \xe2\x80\x9cany such interpretation is no longer good law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.,</em> \xc2\xb612.  It \xe2\x80\x9cclarif[ied] \xe2\x80\xa6 that the mere fact that specific words or phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a finding that material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium is not indecent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because, however, \xe2\x80\x9cexisting precedent would have permitted this broadcast,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission determined that \xe2\x80\x9cNBC and its affiliates necessarily did not have the requisite notice to justify a penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4981\xe2\x80\x934982, \xc2\xb615.</p>\n<p align="left">II.\xe2\x80\x82The Present Case</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns utterances in two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television Stations, Inc., and its affiliates prior to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Golden Globes Order</em>.  The first occurred during the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, when the singer Cher exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve also had critics for the last 40 years saying that I was on my way out every year.  Right.  So f*** \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 9.  The second involved a segment of the 2003 Billboard Music Awards, during the presentation of an award by Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton, principals in a Fox television series called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Simple Life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ms. Hilton began their interchange by reminding Ms. Richie to \xe2\x80\x9cwatch the bad language,\xe2\x80\x9d but Ms. Richie proceeded to ask the audience, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do they even call it \xe2\x80\x98The Simple Life?\xe2\x80\x99  Have you ever tried to get cow s*** out of a Prada purse?

Following each of these broadcasts, the Commission received numerous complaints from parents whose children were exposed to the language.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 15, 2006, the Commission released Notices of Apparent Liability for a number of broadcasts that the Commission deemed actionably indecent, including the two described above.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002 and March 8, 2005, </em>21 FCC Rcd. 2664 (2006).  Multiple parties petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for judicial review of the order, asserting a variety of constitutional and statutory challenges.  Since the order had declined to impose sanctions, the Commission had not previously given the broadcasters an opportunity to respond to the indecency charges.  It therefore requested and obtained from the Court of Appeals a voluntary remand so that the parties could air their objections.  489 F.\xc2\xa03d 444, 453 (2007).  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order on remand upheld the indecency findings for the broadcasts described above.  See<em> In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005</em>, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006) <em>(Remand Order)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order first explained that both broadcasts fell comfortably within the subject-matter scope of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s indecency test because the 2003 broadcast involved a literal description of excrement and both broadcasts invoked the \xe2\x80\x9cF-Word,\xe2\x80\x9d which inherently has a sexual connotation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13304, \xc2\xb616, 13323, \xc2\xb658.  The order next determined that the broadcasts were patently offensive under community standards for the medium.  Both broadcasts, it noted, involved entirely gratuitous uses of \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit words for sexual activity in the English language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13305, \xc2\xb617, 13324, \xc2\xb659.  It found Ms. Richie\xe2\x80\x99s use of the \xe2\x80\x9cF-Word\xe2\x80\x9d and her \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit description of the handling of excrement\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cvulgar and shocking,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cpandering,\xe2\x80\x9d after Ms. Hilton had playfully warned her to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98watch the bad language.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13305, \xc2\xb617.  And it found Cher\xe2\x80\x99s statement patently offensive in part because she metaphorically suggested a sexual act as a means of expressing hostility to her critics.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13324, \xc2\xb660.  The order relied upon the \xe2\x80\x9ccritically important\xe2\x80\x9d context of the utterances, <em>id.</em>, at 13304, \xc2\xb615, noting that they were aired during prime-time awards shows \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to draw a large nationwide audience that could be expected to include many children interested in seeing their favorite music stars,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 13305, \xc2\xb618, 13324, \xc2\xb659.  Indeed, approximately 2.5 million minors witnessed each of the broadcasts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13306, \xc2\xb618, 13326, \xc2\xb665.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order asserted that both broadcasts under review would have been actionably indecent under the staff rulings and Commission dicta in effect prior to the <em>Golden Globes Order</em>\xe2\x80\x94the 2003 broadcast because it involved a literal description of excrement, rather than a mere expletive, because it used more than one offensive word, and because it was planned, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \xc2\xb622; and the 2002 broadcast because Cher used the F-Word not as a mere intensifier, but as a description of the sexual act to express hostility to her critics, <em>id.</em>, at 13324, \xc2\xb660.  The order stated, however, that the pre-<em>Golden Globes </em>regime of immunity for isolated indecent expletives rested only upon staff rulings and Commission dicta, and that the Commission itself had never held \xe2\x80\x9cthat the isolated use of an expletive \xe2\x80\xa6 was not indecent or could not be indecent,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \xc2\xb621.  In any event, the order made clear, the <em>Golden Globes Order </em>eliminated any doubt that fleeting expletives could be actionably indecent, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \xc2\xb623, 13325, \xc2\xb661, and the Commission disavowed the bureau-level decisions and its own dicta that had said otherwise, <em>id.</em>, at 13306\xe2\x80\x9313307, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb620, 21.  Under the new policy, a lack of repetition \xe2\x80\x9cweigh[s] against a finding of indecency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 13325, \xc2\xb661, but is not a safe harbor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order explained that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s prior \xe2\x80\x9cstrict dichotomy between \xe2\x80\x98expletives\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98descriptions or depictions of sexual or excretory functions\xe2\x80\x99 is artificial and does not make sense in light of the fact that an \xe2\x80\x98expletive\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 power to offend derives from its sexual or excretory meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13308, \xc2\xb623.  In the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cgranting an automatic exemption for \xe2\x80\x98isolated or fleeting\xe2\x80\x99 expletives unfairly forces viewers (including children)\xe2\x80\x9d to take \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the first blow\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and would allow broadcasters \xe2\x80\x9cto air expletives at all hours of a day so long as they did so one at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13309, \xc2\xb625.  Although the Commission determined that Fox encouraged the offensive language by using suggestive scripting in the 2003 broadcast, and unreasonably failed to take adequate precautions in both broadcasts, <em>id.</em>, at 13311\xe2\x80\x9313314, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb631\xe2\x80\x9337, the order  again declined to impose any forfeiture or other sanction for either of the broadcasts, <em>id.</em>, at 13321, \xc2\xb653, 13326, \xc2\xb666.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fox returned to the Second Circuit for review of the <em>Remand Order</em>, and various intervenors including CBS, NBC, and ABC joined the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed the agency\xe2\x80\x99s orders, finding the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure Act.<em> </em>489 F.\xc2\xa03d 444.  The majority was \xe2\x80\x9cskeptical that the Commission [could] provide a reasoned explanation for its \xe2\x80\x98fleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x99 regime that would pass constitutional muster,\xe2\x80\x9d but it declined to reach the constitutional question.  <em>Id.,</em> at 462.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551 <em>et seq.</em>, which sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for procedural correctness, see <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/519/index.html">435 U. S. 519</a>, 545\xe2\x80\x93549 (1978), permits (insofar as relevant here) the setting aside of agency action that is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccapricious,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  Under what we have called this \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review, we insist that an agency \xe2\x80\x9cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Second Circuit has interpreted the Administrative Procedure Act and our opinion in <em>State Farm </em>as<em> </em>requiring agencies to make clear \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98why the original reasons for adopting the [displaced] rule or policy are no longer dispositive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98why the new rule effectuates the statute as well as or better than the old rule.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  489 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 456\xe2\x80\x93457 (quoting <em>New York Council, Assn. of Civilian Technicians </em>v.<em> FLRA</em>, 757 F.\xc2\xa02d 502, 508 (CA2 1985); emphasis deleted).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has similarly indicated that a court\xe2\x80\x99s standard of review is \xe2\x80\x9cheightened somewhat\xe2\x80\x9d when an agency reverses course.  <em>NAACP </em>v.<em> FCC</em>, 682 F.\xc2\xa02d 993, 998 (1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find no basis in the Administrative Procedure Act or in our opinions for a requirement that all agency change be subjected to more searching review.  The Act mentions no such heightened standard.  And our opinion in <em>State Farm</em> neither held nor implied that every agency action representing a policy change must be justified by reasons more substantial than those required to adopt a policy in the first instance.  That case, which involved the rescission of a prior regulation, said only that such action requires \xe2\x80\x9ca reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency <em>does not act</em> in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 42 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Treating failures to act and rescissions of prior action differently for purposes of the standard of review makes good sense, and has basis in the text of the statute, which likewise treats the two separately.  It instructs a reviewing court to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(1), and to \xe2\x80\x9chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be [among other things] \xe2\x80\xa6 arbitrary [or] capricious,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7706(2)(A). <em> </em>The statute makes no distinction, however, between initial agency action and subsequent agency action undoing or revising that action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it <em>is </em>changing position.  An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior policy <em>sub silentio </em>or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.  See<em> United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/index.html">418 U. S. 683</a>, 696 (1974).  And of course the agency must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.  But it need not demonstrate to a court\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are <em>better</em> than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency <em>believes </em>it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.  This means that the agency need not always provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.  Sometimes it must\xe2\x80\x94when, for example, its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.  <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/735/index.html">517 U. S. 735</a>, 742 (1996).  It would be arbitrary or capricious to ignore such matters.  In such cases it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this appeal from the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s setting aside of Commission action for failure to comply with a procedural requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act, the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 arguments have repeatedly referred to the First Amendment.  If they mean to invite us to apply a more stringent arbitrary-and-capricious review to agency actions that implicate constitutional liberties, we reject the invitation.  The so-called canon of constitutional avoidance is an interpretive tool, counseling that ambiguous statutory language be construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.  See <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988).  We know of no precedent for applying it to limit the scope of authorized executive action.  In the same section authorizing courts to set aside \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary [or] capricious\xe2\x80\x9d agency action, the Administrative Procedure Act separately provides for setting aside agency action that is \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A), which of course includes unconstitutional action.  We think that is the only context in which constitutionality bears upon judicial review of authorized agency action.  If the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s action here was not arbitrary or capricious in the ordinary sense, it satisfies the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary [or] capricious\xe2\x80\x9d standard; its lawfulness under the Constitution is a separate question to be addressed in a constitutional challenge.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B.\xe2\x80\x82Application to This Case</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judged under the above described standards, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s new enforcement policy and its order finding the broadcasts actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  First, the Commission forthrightly acknowledged that its recent actions have broken new ground, taking account of inconsistent \xe2\x80\x9cprior Commission and staff action\xe2\x80\x9d and explicitly disavowing them as \xe2\x80\x9cno longer good law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Golden Globes Order, </em>19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \xc2\xb612.  To be sure, the (superfluous) explanation in its <em>Remand Order </em>of why the Cher broadcast would even have violated its earlier policy may not be entirely convincing.  But that unnecessary detour is irrelevant.  There is no doubt that the Commission knew it was making a change.  That is why it declined to assess penalties; and it relied on the <em>Golden Globes Order </em>as removing any lingering doubt.  <em>Remand Order</em>, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \xc2\xb623, 13325, \xc2\xb661.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for expanding the scope of its enforcement activity were entirely rational.  It was certainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense to distinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offensive words, requiring repetitive use to render only the latter indecent.  As the Commission said with regard to expletive use of the F-Word, \xe2\x80\x9cthe word\xe2\x80\x99s power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13323, \xc2\xb658.  And the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s decision to look at the patent offensiveness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with the context-based approach we sanctioned in <em>Pacifica</em>, 438 U. S., at 750.  Even isolated utterances can be made in \xe2\x80\x9cpander[ing,] \xe2\x80\xa6 vulgar and shocking\xe2\x80\x9d manners, <em>Remand Order</em>,<em> </em>21 FCC Rcd., at 13305, \xc2\xb617, and can constitute harmful \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98first blow[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to children, <em>id.</em>, at 13309, \xc2\xb625.  It is surely rational (if not inescapable) to believe that a safe harbor for single words would \xe2\x80\x9clikely lead to more widespread use of the offensive language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Golden Globes Order, supra,</em> at 4979, \xc2\xb69.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When confronting other requests for <em>per se </em>rules governing its enforcement of the indecency prohibition, the Commission has declined to create safe harbors for particular types of broadcasts.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Pacifica Foundation, Inc.</em>, 2 FCC Rcd., at 2699, \xc2\xb612 (repudiating the view that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement power was limited to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate, repetitive use of the seven words actually contained in the George Carlin monologue\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Infinity Broadcasting Corp. of Pa.</em>, 3 FCC Rcd., at 932, \xc2\xb617 (\xe2\x80\x9creject[ing] an approach that would hold that if a work has merit, it is <em>per se </em>not indecent\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Commission could rationally decide it needed to step away from its old regime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive was <em>per se </em>nonactionable because that was \xe2\x80\x9cat odds with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s overall enforcement policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Remand Order</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 13308, \xc2\xb623.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that technological advances have made it easier for broadcasters to bleep out offending words further supports the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s stepped-up enforcement policy.  <em>Golden Globes Order, supra,</em> at 4980, \xc2\xb611.<font super="1">  And the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to impose any forfeiture or other sanction precludes any argument that it is arbitrarily punishing parties without notice of the potential consequences of their action.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">C.\xe2\x80\x82The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 Reasoning</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals found the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s action arbitrary and capricious on three grounds.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are some propositions for which scant empirical evidence can be marshaled, and the harmful effect of broadcast profanity on children is one of them.  One cannot demand a multiyear controlled study, in which some children are intentionally exposed to indecent broadcasts (and insulated from all other indecency), and others are shielded from all indecency.  It is one thing to set aside agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act because of failure to adduce empirical data that can readily be obtained.  See, <em>e.g., State Farm</em>, 463 U. S., at 46\xe2\x80\x9356 (addressing the costs and benefits of mandatory passive restraints for automobiles).  It is something else to insist upon obtaining the unobtainable.  Here it suffices to know that children mimic the behavior they observe\xe2\x80\x94or at least the behavior that is presented to them as normal and appropriate.  Programming replete with one-word indecent expletives will tend to produce children who use (at least) one-word indecent expletives.  Congress has made the determination that indecent material is harmful to children, and has left enforcement of the ban to the Commission.  If enforcement had to be supported by empirical data, the ban would effectively be a nullity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission had adduced no quantifiable measure of the harm caused by the language in <em>Pacifica</em>,<em> </em>and we nonetheless held that the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the \xe2\x80\x98well-being of its youth\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 justified the regulation of otherwise protected expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  438 U. S., at 749 (quoting <em>Ginsberg</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/index.html">390 U. S. 629</a>, 640, 639 (1968)).  If the Constitution itself demands of agencies no more scientifically certain criteria to comply with the First Amendment, neither does the Administrative Procedure Act to comply with the requirement of reasoned decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court\xe2\x80\x99s second objection is that fidelity to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow\xe2\x80\x9d theory of harm would require a categorical ban on <em>all </em>broadcasts of expletives; the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to go to this extreme thus undermined the coherence of its rationale.  489 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  This objection, however, is not responsive to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s actual policy under review\xe2\x80\x94the decision to include patently offensive fleeting expletives within the definition of indecency.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s prior enforcement practice, unchallenged here, already drew distinctions between the offensiveness of particular words based upon the context in which they appeared.  Any complaint about the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s failure to ban only some fleeting expletives is better directed at the agency\xe2\x80\x99s context-based system generally rather than its inclusion of isolated expletives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More fundamentally, however, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to consider the patent offensiveness of isolated expletives on a case-by-case basis is not arbitrary or capricious.  \xe2\x80\x9cEven a prime-time recitation of Geoffrey Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Tale,\xe2\x80\x9d we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not be likely to command the attention of many children who are both old enough to understand and young enough to be adversely affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pacifica</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 750, n. 29.  The same rationale could support the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s finding that a broadcast of the film Saving Private Ryan<em> </em>was not indecent\xe2\x80\x94a finding to which the broadcasters point as supposed evidence of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistency.  The frightening suspense and the graphic violence in the movie could well dissuade the most vulnerable from watching and would put parents on notice of potentially objectionable material.  See<em> In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Against Various Television Licensees Regarding Their Broadcast on Nov. 11, 2004 of the ABC Television Network\xe2\x80\x99s Presentation of the Film \xe2\x80\x9cSaving Private Ryan,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> 20 FCC Rcd. 4507, 4513, \xc2\xb615 (2005) (noting that the broadcast was not \xe2\x80\x9cintended as family entertainment\xe2\x80\x9d).  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to retain some discretion does not render arbitrary or capricious its regulation of the deliberate and shocking uses of offensive language at the award shows under review\xe2\x80\x94shows that were expected to (and did) draw the attention of millions of children.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals found unconvincing the agency\xe2\x80\x99s prediction (without any evidence) that a <em>per se</em> exemption for fleeting expletives would lead to increased use of expletives one at a time.  489 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 460.  But even in the absence of evidence, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s predictive judgment (which merits deference) makes entire sense.  To predict that complete immunity for fleeting expletives, ardently desired by broadcasters, will lead to a substantial increase in fleeting expletives seems to us an exercise in logic rather than clairvoyance.  The Court of Appeals was perhaps correct that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s prior policy had not yet caused broadcasters to \xe2\x80\x9cbarrag[e] the airwaves with expletives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em> That may have been because its prior permissive policy had been confirmed (save in dicta) only at the staff level.  In any event, as the <em>Golden Globes </em>order demonstrated, it did produce more expletives than the Commission (which has the first call in this matter) deemed in conformity with the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">D.\xe2\x80\x82Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Arguments</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents press some arguments that the court did not adopt.  They claim that the Commission failed to acknowledge its change in enforcement policy.  That contention is not tenable in light of the <em>Golden Globes Order</em>\xe2\x80\x99s specific declaration that its prior rulings were no longer good law, 19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \xc2\xb612, and the <em>Remand Order</em>\xe2\x80\x99s disavowal of those staff rulings and Commission dicta as \xe2\x80\x9cseriously flawed,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \xc2\xb623.  The broadcasters also try to recharacterize the nature of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s shift, contending that the old policy was not actually a <em>per se</em> rule against liability for isolated expletives and that the new policy is a presumption of indecency for certain words.  This description of the prior agency policy conflicts with the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 own prior position in this case.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief in Opposition for Respondent Fox Television Stations, Inc., et al. 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cFor almost 30 years following Pacifica, the FCC did not consider fleeting, isolated or inadvertent expletives to be indecent\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we find no basis for the contention that the Commission has now adopted a presumption of indecency; its repeated reliance on context refutes this claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The broadcasters also make much of the fact that the Commission has gone beyond the scope of authority approved in <em>Pacifica</em>, which it once regarded as the farthest extent of its power.  But we have never held that <em>Pacifica</em> represented the outer limits of permissible regulation, so that fleeting expletives <em>may not</em> be forbidden.  To the contrary, we explicitly left for another day whether \xe2\x80\x9can occasional expletive\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9ca telecast of an Elizabethan comedy\xe2\x80\x9d could be prohibited.  438 U. S., at 748.  By using the narrowness of <em>Pacifica</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding to require empirical evidence of harm before the Commission regulates more broadly, the broadcasters attempt to turn the sword of <em>Pacifica</em>, which allowed <em>some </em>regulation of broadcast indecency, into an administrative-law shield preventing any regulation beyond what <em>Pacifica </em>sanctioned.  Nothing prohibits federal agencies from moving in an incremental manner. <em> </em>Cf.<em> National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 1002 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the broadcasters claim that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s repeated appeal to \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d is simply a smokescreen for a standardless regime of unbridled discretion.  But we have previously approved Commission regulation based \xe2\x80\x9con a nuisance rationale under which context is all-important,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pacifica</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 750, and we find no basis in the Administrative Procedure Act for mandating anything different.</p>\n<p align="left">E.\xe2\x80\x82The Dissents\xe2\x80\x99 Arguments</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer purports to \xe2\x80\x9cbegin with applicable law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 1, but in fact<em> </em>begins by stacking the deck.  He claims that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s status as an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d agency sheltered from political oversight requires courts to be \xe2\x80\x9call the more\xe2\x80\x9d vigilant in ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cthat major policy decisions be based upon articulable reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1, 2.  Not so.  The independent agencies are sheltered not from politics but from the President, and it has often been observed that their freedom from presidential oversight (and protection) has simply been replaced by increased subservience to congressional direction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Sealed Case</em>, 838 F.\xc2\xa02d 476, 507\xe2\x80\x93508 (CADC) (Silberman, J.), rev\xe2\x80\x99d<em> sub\xc2\xa0nom.

Indeed, the precise policy change at issue here was spurred by significant political pressure from Congress.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens apparently recognizes this political control by Congress, and indeed sees it as the manifestation of a principal-agency relationship.  In his judgment, the FCC is \xe2\x80\x9cbetter viewed as an agent of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d than as part of the Executive.  <em>Post, </em>at 3 (dissenting opinion).  He nonetheless argues that this is a good reason for requiring the FCC to explain \xe2\x80\x9cwhy its prior policy is no longer sound before allowing it to change course.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 4.  Leaving aside the unconstitutionality of a scheme giving the power to enforce laws to agents of Congress, see <em>Bowsher</em> v. <em>Synar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/index.html">478 U. S. 714</a>, 726 (1986), it seems to us that Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion does not follow from his premise.  If the FCC is indeed an agent of Congress, it would seem an adequate explanation of its change of position that Congress made clear its wishes for stricter enforcement, see n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</em>  The Administrative Procedure Act, after all, does not apply to Congress and its agencies.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, it is assuredly not \xe2\x80\x9capplicable law\xe2\x80\x9d that rulemaking by independent regulatory agencies is subject to heightened scrutiny.  The Administrative Procedure Act, which provides judicial review, makes no distinction between independent and other agencies, neither in its definition of agency, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(b)(1), nor in the standards for reviewing agency action, \xc2\xa7706.  Nor does any case of ours express or reflect the \xe2\x80\x9cheightened scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens would impose.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine any closer scrutiny than that we have given to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is not an independent agency.  See <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/497/index.html">549 U. S. 497</a>, 533\xe2\x80\x93535 (2007); <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 481\xe2\x80\x93486 (2001).  There is no reason to magnify the separation-of-powers dilemma posed by the Headless Fourth Branch, see<em> Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html">501 U.

Neither of these omissions could undermine the coherence of the rationale the agency gave, but the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation of each is flawed in its own right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, both claim that the Commission failed adequately to explain its consideration of the constitutional issues inherent in its regulation, <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.); <em>post,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x937 (opinion of Stevens,\xc2\xa0J.).  We are unaware that we have ever before reversed an executive agency, not for violating our cases, but for failure to discuss them adequately.  But leave that aside.  According to Justice Breyer, the agency said \xe2\x80\x9cnext to nothing about the relation between the change it made in its prior \xe2\x80\x98fleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x99 policy and the First-Amendment-related need to avoid \xe2\x80\x98censorship,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The <em>Remand Order</em> does, however, devote four full pages of small-type, single-spaced text (over 1,300 words not counting the footnotes) to explaining why the Commission believes that its indecency-enforcement regime (which includes its change in policy) is consistent with the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x94and therefore not censorship as the term is understood.  More specifically, Justice Breyer faults the FCC for \xe2\x80\x9cnot explain[ing] why the agency changed its mind about the line that <em>Pacifica</em> draws or its policy\xe2\x80\x99s relation to that line,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 10.  But in fact (and as the Commission explained) this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Pacifica, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/726/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a>,<em> </em>drew no constitutional line; to the contrary, it expressly declined to express any view on the constitutionality of prohibiting isolated indecency.  Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens evidently believe that when an agency has obtained this Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a less restrictive rule is constitutional, its successors acquire some special burden to explain why a more restrictive rule is not <em>un</em>constitutional.   We know of no such principle.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Justice Breyer looks over the vast field of particular factual scenarios unaddressed by the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s 35-page <em>Remand Order</em> and finds one that is fatal: the plight of the small local broadcaster who cannot afford the new technology that enables the screening of live broadcasts for indecent utterances.  Cf. <em>post,</em> at 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  The Commission has failed to address the fate of this unfortunate, who will, he believes, be subject to sanction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We doubt, to begin with, that small-town broadcasters run a heightened risk of liability for indecent utterances.  In programming that they originate, their down-home local guests probably employ vulgarity less than big-city folks; and small-town stations generally cannot afford or cannot attract foul-mouthed glitteratae from Hollywood.  Their main exposure with regard to self-originated programming is live coverage of news and public affairs.  But the <em>Remand Order</em> went out of its way to note that the case at hand did not involve \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking news coverage,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cit may be inequitable to hold a licensee responsible for airing offensive speech during live coverage of a public event,\xe2\x80\x9d  21 FCC Rcd., at 13311, \xc2\xb633.  As for the programming that small stations receive on a network \xe2\x80\x9cfeed\xe2\x80\x9d: This <em>will </em>be cleansed by the expensive technology small stations (by Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesis) cannot afford.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But never mind the detail of whether small broadcasters are uniquely subject to a great risk of punishment for fleeting expletives.  The fundamental fallacy of Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s small-broadcaster gloomyscenario is its demonstrably false assumption that the <em>Remand Order</em> makes no provision for the avoidance of unfairness\xe2\x80\x94that the single-utterance prohibition will be invoked uniformly, in all situations.  The <em>Remand</em> <em>Order </em>made very clear that this is not the case.  It said that in determining \xe2\x80\x9cwhat, if any, remedy is appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission would consider the facts of each individual case, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of human error in using delay equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 13313, \xc2\xb635.  Thus, the fact that the agency believed that Fox (a large broadcaster that used suggestive scripting and a deficient delay system to air a prime-time awards show aimed at millions of children) \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to exercise \xe2\x80\x98reasonable judgment, responsibility and sensitivity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 13311, \xc2\xb633, and n. 91 (quoting <em>Pacifica Foundation, Inc.</em>, 2 FCC Rcd., at 2700, \xc2\xb618), says little about how the Commission would treat smaller broadcasters who cannot afford screening equipment.  Indeed, that they would not be punished for failing to purchase equipment they cannot afford is positively suggested by the <em>Remand Order\xe2\x80\x99</em>s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]olding Fox responsible for airing indecent material in this case does not \xe2\x80\xa6 impose undue burdens on broadcasters.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 FCC Rcd., at 13313, \xc2\xb636.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was, in sum, no need for the Commission to compose a special treatise on local broadcasters.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  And Justice Breyer can safely defer his concern for those yeomen of the airwaves until we have before us a case that involves one.</p>\n<p align="left">IV.\xe2\x80\x82Constitutionality</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit did not definitively rule on the constitutionality of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s orders, but respondents nonetheless ask us to decide their validity under the First Amendment.  This Court, however, is one of final review, \xe2\x80\x9cnot of first view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/709/index.html">544 U.

It is conceivable that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s orders may cause some broadcasters to avoid certain language that is beyond the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s reach under the Constitution.  Whether that is so, and, if so, whether it is unconstitutional, will be determined soon enough, perhaps in this very case.  Meanwhile, any chilled references to excretory and sexual material \xe2\x80\x9csurely lie at the periphery of First Amendment concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pacifica,</em> 438 U. S., at 743 (plurality opinion of Stevens, J.).  We see no reason to abandon our usual procedures in a rush to judgment without a lower court opinion.

Assuming the premise is true (for this point the Second Circuit did not demand empirical evidence) the conclusion does not necessarily follow.  The Commission could reasonably conclude that the pervasiveness of foul language, and the coarsening of public entertainment in other media such as cable, justify more stringent regulation of broadcast programs so as to give conscientious parents a relatively safe haven for their children.  In the end, the Second Circuit and the broadcasters quibble with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy choices and not with the explanation it has given.

See <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U.

But Justice Breyer does not urge that <em>we</em> issue such a holding, evidently agreeing that we should limit our review to what the Court of Appeals decided, see Part IV, <em>infra</em>\xe2\x80\x94which included only the adequacy of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking procedure, and not the statutory question.  Rather, Justice Breyer seeks a \xe2\x80\x9cremand [that] would do no more than ask the agency to reconsider its policy decision in light of\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional concerns.  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  That strange and novel disposition would be entirely unrelated to the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, and would better be termed the doctrine of judicial arm-twisting or appellate review by the wagged finger.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A Subcommittee of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s House oversight Committee held hearings on the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast indecency enforcement on January 28, 2004.  \xe2\x80\x9cCan You Say That on TV?\xe2\x80\x9d: An Examination of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s Enforcement with respect to Broadcast Indecency, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 108th Cong., 2d Sess.

It is quite irrelevant, however, to the extrastatutory influence Congress exerts over agencies of the Executive Branch, which is exerted by the congressional committees responsible for oversight and appropriations with respect to the relevant agency.

This separate writing is to underscore certain background principles for the conclusion that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency sets a new course that reverses an earlier determination but does not provide a reasoned explanation for doing so.  In those circumstances I agree with the dissenting opinion of Justice Breyer that the agency must explain why \xe2\x80\x9cit now reject[s] the considerations that led it to adopt that initial policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether a change in policy requires an agency to provide a more-reasoned explanation than when the original policy was first announced is not susceptible, in my view, to an answer that applies in all cases.  There may be instances when it becomes apparent to an agency that the reasons for a longstanding policy have been altered by discoveries in science, advances in technology, or by any of the other forces at work in a dynamic society.  If an agency seeks to respond to new circumstances by modifying its earlier policy, the agency may have a substantial body of data and experience that can shape and inform the new rule.  In other cases the altered circumstances may be so new that the agency must make predictive judgments that are as difficult now as when the agency\xe2\x80\x99s earlier policy was first announced.  Reliance interests in the prior policy may also have weight in the analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in each case is whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for the change, when viewed in light of the data available to it, and when informed by the experience and expertise of the agency, suffice to demonstrate that the new policy rests upon principles that are rational, neutral, and in accord with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s proper understanding of its authority.  That showing may be required if the agency is to demonstrate that its action is not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  And, of course, the agency action must not be \xe2\x80\x9cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7706(2)(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These requirements stem from the administrative agency\xe2\x80\x99s unique constitutional position.  The dynamics of the three branches of Government are well understood as a general matter.  But the role and position of the agency, and the exact locus of its powers, present questions that are delicate, subtle, and complex.  The Federal Government could not perform its duties in a responsible and effective way without administrative agencies.  Yet the amorphous character of the administrative agency in the constitutional system escapes simple explanation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If agencies were permitted unbridled discretion, their actions might violate important constitutional principles of separation of powers and checks and balances.  To that end the Constitution requires that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of lawmaking power to an agency must be \xe2\x80\x9cspecific and detailed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 374 (1989).  Congress must \xe2\x80\x9cclearly delineat[e] the general policy\xe2\x80\x9d an agency is to achieve and must specify the \xe2\x80\x9cboundaries of [the] delegated authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 372\xe2\x80\x93373.  Congress must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the agency must follow it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 372 (quoting <em>J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/276/394/index.html">276 U. S. 394</a>, 409 (1928)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to ensure that agencies follow constraints even as they exercise their powers.  One of these constraints is the duty of agencies to find and formulate policies that can be justified by neutral principles and a reasoned explanation.  To achieve that end, Congress confined agencies\xe2\x80\x99 discretion and subjected their decisions to judicial review.  See R. Stewart &amp; C. Sunstein, Public Programs and Private Rights, 95 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1193, 1248 (1982) (the APA was a \xe2\x80\x9cworking compromise, in which broad delegations of discretion were tolerated as long as they were checked by extensive procedural safeguards\xe2\x80\x9d).  If an agency takes action not based on neutral and rational principles, the APA grants federal courts power to set aside the agency\xe2\x80\x99s action as \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccapricious.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/index.html">401 U. S. 402</a>, 416 (1971).  For these reasons, agencies under the APA are subject to a \xe2\x80\x9csearching and careful\xe2\x80\x9d review by the courts.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where there is a policy change the record may be much more developed because the agency based its prior policy on factual findings.  In that instance, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency ignores or countermands its earlier factual findings without reasoned explanation for doing so.  An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank slate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is the principle followed in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/29/index.html">463 U. S. 29</a> (1983).  There, Congress directed the agency to issue regulations that would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98meet the need for motor vehicle safety.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 33.  The agency promulgated a regulation requiring cars to have passive-restraint systems\xe2\x80\x94either airbags or automatic seatbelts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 37.  The agency based this regulation on its factual finding that these systems save lives.  <em>Id.</em>, at 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following a change in Presidential administration, however, the agency reversed course and rescinded the regulation.  In doing so, the agency did not address its prior finding that airbags save lives.  <em>Id.</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot one sentence\xe2\x80\x9d of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crulemaking statement\xe2\x80\x9d in support of rescinding the regulation discussed the benefits of airbags.  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.  This Court found the agency\xe2\x80\x99s rescission arbitrary and capricious because the agency did not address its prior factual findings.  See <em>id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case does not raise the concerns addressed in <em>State Farm</em>.  Rather than base its prior policy on its knowledge of the broadcast industry and its audience, the FCC instead based its policy on what it considered to be our holding in <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Pacifica Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a> (1978).  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation, </em>69 F.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d 1250, 1254, \xc2\xb610 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe intend strictly to observe the narrowness of the <em>Pacifica </em>holding\xe2\x80\x9d).  The FCC did not base its prior policy on factual findings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s Remand Order explains that the agency has changed its reading of <em>Pacifica</em>.  The reasons the agency announces for this change are not so precise, detailed, or elaborate as to be a model for agency explanation.  But, as the opinion for the Court well explains, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for its action were the sort of reasons an agency may consider and act upon.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s careful and complete analysis\xe2\x80\x94both with respect to the procedural history of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s indecency policies, and the reasons the agency has given to support them\xe2\x80\x94is quite sufficient to sustain the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s change of course against respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the agency acted in an arbitrary or capricious fashion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The holding of the Court of Appeals turned on its conclusion that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for its change of policy was insufficient, and that is the only question presented here.  I agree with the Court that as this case comes to us from the Court of Appeals we must reserve judgment on the question whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s action is consistent with the guarantees of the Constitution.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962921">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nFCC V.

I write separately, however, to note the questionable viability of the two precedents that support the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of constitutional authority to regulate the programming at issue in this case.  See <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/index.html">395 U. S. 367</a> (1969); <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Pacifica Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a> (1978).  <em>Red Lion </em>and <em>Pacifica</em> were unconvincing when they were issued, and the passage of time has only increased doubt regarding their continued validity.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe text of the First Amendment makes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable media, but we have done so\xe2\x80\x9d in these cases.  <em>Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/727/index.html">518 U. S. 727</a>, 812 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Red Lion</em>, this Court upheld the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfairness doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d a Government requirement \xe2\x80\x9cthat discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  395 U. S., at 369, 400\xe2\x80\x93401.  The decision relied heavily on the scarcity of available broadcast frequencies.  According to the Court, because broadcast spectrum was so scarce, it \xe2\x80\x9ccould be regulated and rationalized only by the Government.  Without government control, the medium would be of little use because of the cacophony of competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 376<em>.</em>  To this end, the Court concluded that the Government should be \xe2\x80\x9cpermitted to put restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on this unique medium.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 390; see also <em>id.</em>, at 389 (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the First Amendment is concerned those who are licensed stand no better than those to whom licenses are refused\xe2\x80\x9d).  Applying this principle, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t does not violate the First Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using scarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire community, obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of great public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 394.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Red Lion </em>specifically declined to answer whether the First Amendment authorized the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crefusal to permit the broadcaster to carry a particular program or to publish his own views[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 [or] government censorship of a particular program,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 396.  But then in <em>Pacifica</em>, this Court rejected a challenge to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose sanctions on the broadcast of indecent material.  See 438 U. S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93730, 750\xe2\x80\x93751; <em>id</em>., at 742 (plurality opinion), relying on <em>Red Lion</em>, the Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcasting \xe2\x80\xa6 has received the most limited First Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  438 U. S.,<em> </em>at 748.<em> </em>The Court also emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely pervasive presence\xe2\x80\x9d of the broadcast media in Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives and the fact that broadcast programming was \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely accessible to children.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 748\xe2\x80\x93749.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, which the Court has justified based only on the nature of the medium, is problematic on two levels.  First, instead of looking to first principles to evaluate the constitutional question, the Court relied on a set of transitory facts, <em>e.g.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9cscarcity of radio frequencies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Red Lion, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 390, to determine the applicable First Amendment standard.  But the original meaning of the Constitution cannot turn on modern necessity: \xe2\x80\x9cConstitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 63).  In breaching this principle, <em>Red Lion</em> adopted, and <em>Pacifica </em>reaffirmed, a legal rule that lacks any textual basis in the Constitution.  <em>Denver Area, supra</em>, at 813 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment distinctions between media [have been] dubious from their infancy\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the logical weakness of <em>Red Lion </em>and <em>Pacifica</em> has been apparent for some time: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly true that broadcast frequencies are scarce but it is unclear why that fact justifies content regulation of broadcasting in a way that would be intolerable if applied to the editorial process of the print media.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>801 F.\xc2\xa02d 501, 508 (CADC 1986) (Bork, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Highlighting the doctrinal incoherence of <em>Red Lion </em>and <em>Pacifica</em>, the Court has declined to apply the lesser standard of First Amendment scrutiny imposed on broadcast speech to federal regulation of telephone dial-in services, see <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/115/index.html">492 U.

Broadcast spectrum is significantly less scarce than it was 40 years ago.  See Brief for Respondents NBC Universal et\xc2\xa0al. 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (hereinafter NBC Brief).  As NBC notes, the number of over-the-air broadcast stations grew from 7,411 in 1969, when <em>Red Lion </em>was issued, to 15,273 by the end of 2004.  See NBC Brief 38; see also FCC Media Bureau Staff Research Paper, J. Berresford, The Scarcity Rationale for Regulating Traditional Broadcasting: An Idea Whose Time Has Passed 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (Mar. 2005) (No. 2005\xe2\x80\x932).  And the trend should continue with broadcast television\xe2\x80\x99s imminent switch from analog to digital transmission, which will allow the FCC to \xe2\x80\x9cstack broadcast channels right beside one another along the spectrum, and ultimately utilize significantly less than the 400 MHz of spectrum the analog system absorbs today.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Consumer Electronics Assn.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 294 (CADC 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, traditional broadcast television and radio are no longer the \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely pervasive\xe2\x80\x9d media forms they once were.  For most consumers, traditional broadcast media programming is now bundled with cable or satellite services.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a.  Broadcast and other video programming is also widely available over the Internet.  See Stelter, Serving Up Television Without the TV Set, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Mar. 10, 2008, p. C1.  And like radio and television broadcasts, Internet access is now often freely available over the airwaves and can be accessed by portable computer, cell phones, and other wireless devices.  See May, Charting a New Constitutional Jurisprudence for the Digital Age, 3 Charleston L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 373, 375 (2009).  The extant facts that drove this Court to subject broadcasters to unique disfavor under the First Amendment simply do not exist today.  See <em>In re</em> <em>Industry Guidance, supra</em>, at 8020 (statement of Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf rules regulating broadcast content were ever a justifiable infringement of speech, it was because of the relative dominance of that medium in the communications marketplace of the past.

Its explanation fails to discuss two critical factors, at least one of which directly underlay its original policy decision.  Its explanation instead discussed several factors well known to it the first time around, which by themselves provide no significant justification for a <em>change</em> of policy.  Consequently, the FCC decision is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A); <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

That law grants those in charge of independent administrative agencies broad authority to determine relevant policy.  But it does not permit them to make policy choices for purely political reasons nor to rest them primarily upon unexplained policy preferences.  Federal Communications Commissioners have fixed terms of office; they are not directly responsible to the voters; and they enjoy an independence expressly designed to insulate them, to a degree, from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the exercise of political oversight.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html">501 U. S. 868</a>, 916 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/654/index.html">487 U. S. 654</a>, 691, n. 30 (1988).  That insulation helps to secure important governmental objectives, such as the constitutionally related objective of maintaining broadcast regulation that does not bend too readily before the political winds.  But that agency\xe2\x80\x99s comparative freedom from ballot-box control makes it all the more important that courts review its decisionmaking to assure compliance with applicable provisions of the law\xe2\x80\x94including law requiring that major policy decisions be based upon articulable reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory provision applicable here is the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s (APA) prohibition of agency action that is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  This legal requirement helps assure agency decisionmaking based upon more than the personal preferences of the decisionmakers.  Courts have applied the provision sparingly, granting agencies broad policymaking leeway.  But they have also made clear that agency discretion is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unbounded.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/156/index.html">371 U. S. 156</a>, 167\xe2\x80\x93168 (1962).  In so holding, American courts have followed a venerable legal tradition, stretching back at least to the days of Sir Edward Coke and the draining of the English fens.  See <em>Rooke\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 77 Eng. Rep. 209, 210, 5 Coke Rep. 99b, 100a (C. P. 1598) (Coke, J.)

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 953, 954 (1957))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law has also recognized that it is not so much a particular set of substantive commands but rather it is a <em>process</em>, a process of learning through reasoned argument, that is the antithesis of the \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  This means agencies must follow a \xe2\x80\x9clogical and rational\xe2\x80\x9d decisionmaking \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/359/index.html">522 U. S. 359</a>, 374 (1998).  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s policy decisions must reflect the reasoned exercise of expert judgment.  See <em>Burlington Truck Lines, supra</em>, at 167<em> </em>(decision must reflect basis on which agency \xe2\x80\x9cexercised its expert discretion\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/index.html">295 U.

And, as this Court has specified, in determining whether an agency\xe2\x80\x99s policy choice was \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary,\xe2\x80\x9d a reviewing court \xe2\x80\x9cmust consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton Park, supra</em>, at 416.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, an agency must act consistently.  The agency must follow its own rules.  <em>Arizona Grocery Co.</em> v. <em>Atchison, T.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/284/370/index.html">284 U. S. 370</a>, 389\xe2\x80\x93390 (1932).<em> </em>And when an agency seeks to change those rules, it must focus on the fact of change and explain the basis for that change.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 981 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Unexplained </em>inconsistency is\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9creason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To explain a change requires more than setting forth reasons why the new policy is a good one.  It also requires the agency to answer the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you change?\xe2\x80\x9d  And a rational answer to this question typically requires a more complete explanation than would prove satisfactory were change itself not at issue.  An (imaginary) administrator explaining why he chose a policy that requires driving on the right-side, rather than the left-side, of the road might say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, one side seemed as good as the other, so I flipped a coin.\xe2\x80\x9d  But even assuming the rationality of that explanation for an <em>initial</em> choice, that explanation is not at all rational if offered to explain why the administrator <em>changed </em>driving practice, from right-side to left-side, 25 years later.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>State Farm</em>,<em> </em>a unanimous Court applied these commonsense requirements to an agency decision that rescinded an earlier agency policy.  The Court wrote that an agency must provide an explanation for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s <em>\xe2\x80\x9crevocation\xe2\x80\x9d </em>of a prior action that is more thorough than the explanation necessary when it does not act in the first instance.  The Court defined \xe2\x80\x9crevocation,\xe2\x80\x9d not simply as <em>rescinding </em>an earlier policy, cf. <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, but as \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>reversal</em> <em>of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s former views</em> as to the proper course.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Farm</em>, 463 U. S., at 41 (emphasis added). See also <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/467/index.html">535 U. S. 467</a>, 502, n. 20 (2002) (portion of Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion joined by Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ.) (noting <em>State Farm</em> \xe2\x80\x9cmay be read as prescribing more searching judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9can agency [is] \xe2\x80\x98changing its course\xe2\x80\x99 as to the interpretation of a statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ.</em> v. <em>Shalala</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/504/index.html">512 U. S. 504</a>, 524, n. 3 (1994) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (similar).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Court described the need for explanation in terms that apply, not simply to pure <em>rescissions </em>of earlier rules, but rather to changes of policy as it more broadly defined them.  But see <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  It said that the law required an explanation for such a <em>change </em>because the earlier policy, representing a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled course of behavior[,] embodies the agency\xe2\x80\x99s informed judgment that, by pursuing that course, it will carry out the policies \xe2\x80\xa6 best if the settled rule is adhered to.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Farm, supra</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  Thus, the agency must explain <em>why</em> it has come to the conclusion that it should now change direction.  Why does it now reject the considerations that led it to adopt that initial policy?  What has changed in the world that offers justification for the change?  What other good reasons are there for departing from the earlier policy?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of this dissent, it would not (and <em>State Farm </em>does not) require a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>heightened standard\xe2\x80\x9d </em>of review.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 10 (emphasis added).  Rather, the law requires application of the <em>same standard </em>of review to different circumstances, namely circumstances characterized by the fact that <em>change </em>is at issue.  It requires the agency to focus upon the fact of change where change is relevant, just as it must focus upon any other relevant circumstance.  It requires the agency here to focus upon the reasons that led the agency to adopt the initial policy, and to explain why it now comes to a new judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that <em>sometimes </em>the ultimate explanation for a change may have to be, \xe2\x80\x9cWe now weigh the relevant considerations differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  But at other times, an agency can and should say more.  Where, for example, the agency rested its previous policy on particular factual findings, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); or where an agency rested its prior policy on its view of the governing law, see <em>infra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311; or where an agency rested its previous policy on, say, a special need to coordinate with another agency, one would normally expect the agency to focus upon those earlier views of fact, of law, or of policy and explain why they are no longer controlling.  Regardless, to say that the agency here must answer the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhy change\xe2\x80\x9d is not to require the agency to provide a justification that is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>better</em> than the reasons for the old [policy].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 11.  It is only to recognize the obvious fact that <em>change </em>is sometimes (not always) a relevant background feature that sometimes (not always) requires focus (upon prior justifications) and explanation lest the adoption of the new policy (in that circumstance) be \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is certainly how courts of appeals, the courts that review agency decisions, have always treated the matter in practice.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen\xe2\x80\x99s Clubs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kempthorne</em>, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 337, 351 (CA3 2007); <em>Yale-New Haven Hosp</em>. v. <em>Leavitt</em>, 470 F. 3d 71, 79 (CA2 2006); <em>Citizens Awareness Network, Inc</em>. v. <em>United States</em>, 391 F. 3d 338, 352 (CA1 2004).  But see <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 682 F. 2d 993, 998 (CADC 1982) (using word \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding could in this respect significantly change judicial review in practice, and not in a healthy direction.  But see, <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x935 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  After all, if it is <em>always</em> legally sufficient for the agency to reply to the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhy change?\xe2\x80\x9d with the answer \xe2\x80\x9cwe prefer the new policy\xe2\x80\x9d (even when the agency <em>has not considered</em> the major factors that led it to adopt its old policy), then why bother asking the agency to focus on the fact of change?  More to the point, <em>why </em>would the law exempt this and no other aspect of an agency decision from \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious\xe2\x80\x9d review?  Where does, and why would, the APA grant agencies the freedom to change major policies on the basis of nothing more than political considerations or even personal whim?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Avoiding the application of any <em>heightened </em>standard of review, the Court in <em>State Farm </em>recognized that the APA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnonarbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d requirement affords agencies generous leeway when they set policy. <em> </em>463 U. S., at 42.  But it also recognized that this leeway is not absolute.  The Court described its boundaries by then listing considerations that help determine whether an explanation is adequate.  Mirroring and elaborating upon its statement in <em>Overton Park, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/402/index.html">401 U. S. 402</a><em>, </em>the Court said that a reviewing court should take into account whether the agency had \xe2\x80\x9crelied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Farm, supra</em>, at 43; see also<em> Overton Park,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 416.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We here must apply the general standards set forth in <em>State Farm </em>and <em>Overton Park </em>to an agency decision that changes a 25-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x9d policy from (1) the old policy that would normally permit broadcasters to transmit a single, fleeting use of an expletive to (2) a new policy that would threaten broadcasters with large fines for transmitting even a single use (including its use by a member of the public) of such an expletive, alone with nothing more.  The question is whether that decision satisfies the minimal standards necessary to assure a reviewing court that such a change of policy is not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A), particularly as set forth in, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State Farm </em>and<em> Overton Park, supra</em>,<em> </em>at<em> </em>2\xe2\x80\x937<em>.</em>  The decision, in my view, does not satisfy those standards.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the requirement that an agency at least minimally \xe2\x80\x9cconsider \xe2\x80\xa6 important aspect[s] of the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Farm, supra</em>, at 43.  The FCC failed to satisfy this requirement, for it failed to consider two critically important aspects of the problem that underlay its initial policy judgment (one of which directly, the other of which indirectly).  First, the FCC said next to nothing about the relation between the change it made in its prior \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x9d policy and the First-Amendment-related need to avoid \xe2\x80\x9ccensorship,\xe2\x80\x9d a matter as closely related to broadcasting regulation as is health to that of the environment.  The reason that discussion of the matter is particularly important here is that the FCC had <em>explicitly </em>rested its prior policy in large part<em> </em>upon the need to avoid treading too close to the constitutional line.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thirty years ago, the Court considered the location of that constitutional line.  In <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Pacifica Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a> (1978),<em> </em>the Court reviewed an FCC decision forbidding the broadcast of a monologue that deliberately and repeatedly uttered the expletives here at issue more than 100 times in one hour at a time of day when children were likely to hear the broadcast.  <em>Id</em>., at 739.  The Court held that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition did not violate the First Amendment.  But the Court divided 5 to 4.  And two Members of the majority, Justices Powell and Blackmun, explicitly noted that the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak to cases involving <em>the isolated use </em>of a potentially offensive word \xe2\x80\xa6 as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment administered by respondent here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 760\xe2\x80\x93761 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  This statement by two Members of the majority suggested that they could reach a different result, finding an FCC prohibition unconstitutional, were that prohibition aimed at the fleeting or single use of an expletive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC subsequently made clear that it thought that Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence set forth a constitutional line that its indecency policy should embody.  In 1978, the Commission wrote that the First Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cseverely limit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s role in regulating indecency.  It added that the Court, in <em>Pacifica</em>,<em> </em>had \xe2\x80\x9crelied \xe2\x80\xa6 on the repetitive occurrence of the \xe2\x80\x98indecent\xe2\x80\x99 words in question.\xe2\x80\x9d And it said that, in setting policy, it \xe2\x80\x9cintend[ed] strictly to observe the narrowness of the <em>Pacifica</em> holding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation</em>, 69 F.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d 1250, 1254, \xc2\xb610.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1983, the Commission again wrote that it understood the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Pacifica </em>to rest on the \xe2\x80\x9crepetitive occurrence of the \xe2\x80\x98indecent\xe2\x80\x99 words in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, again, the Commission explained that its regulation of fleeting or isolated offensive words would reflect Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  <em>In re Application of Pacifica Foundation</em>, 95 F.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d 750, 760, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb617\xe2\x80\x9318. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 1987, the Commission once more explained that its \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletives\xe2\x80\x9d policy reflected the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Pacifica</em>.  It said that, under its policy, \xe2\x80\x9cspeech that is indecent <em>must</em> involve more than an isolated use of an offensive word,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cwe believe that under the legal standards set forth in <em>Pacifica</em>, deliberate and repetitive use in a patently offensive manner is a requisite to a finding of indecency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Pacifica Foundation</em>, 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \xc2\xb613 (emphasis added).  In another order that same year, the Commission stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe First Amendment dicate[s] a careful and restrained approach with regard to review of matters involving broadcast programming\xe2\x80\x9d; it then explained, citing <em>Pacifica</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peech that is indecent <em>must</em> involve more than the isolated use of an offensive word.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Infinity Broadcasting</em>, 2 FCC Rcd. 2705, 2705, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb66\xe2\x80\x937 (1987) (emphasis added).  And in 2001, in giving the industry guidance, the FCC once again said in respect to its regulation of indecent speech that it \xe2\x80\x9cmust both identify a compelling interest for any regulation \xe2\x80\xa6 and choose the least restrictive means to further that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Industry Guidance On Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Case Law Interpreting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency</em>, 16 FCC Rcd. 7999, 8000\xe2\x80\x938001, \xc2\xb63\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC thus repeatedly made clear that it based its \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x9d policy upon the need to avoid treading too close to the constitutional line as set forth in Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Pacifica </em>concurrence.  What then did it say, when it changed its policy, about <em>why </em>it abandoned this Constitution-based reasoning?  The FCC  devoted \xe2\x80\x9cfour full pages of small-type, single-spaced text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23, responding to industry arguments that, <em>e.g.</em>, changes in the nature of the broadcast industry made <em>all </em>indecency regulation, <em>i.e.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464, unconstitutional.  In doing so it repeatedly <em>reaffirmed </em>its view that <em>Pacifica </em>remains good law. <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002, and March, 8, 2008, </em>21 FCC Rcd. 13299, 13317\xe2\x80\x9313321, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb642\xe2\x80\x9352 (2006) <em>(Remand Order)</em>.  All the more surprising then that, in respect to <em>why </em>it abandoned its prior view about the critical relation between its prior fleeting expletive policy and Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Pacifica </em>concurrence, it says no more than the following:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur decision is not inconsistent with the Supreme Court ruling in <em>Pacifica</em>.  The Court explicitly left open the issue of whether an occasional expletive could be considered indecent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Globe Awards\xe2\x80\x9d Program, </em>19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4982, \xc2\xb616 (2004) <em>(Golden Globe Order)</em>.  And, (repeating what it already had said), \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[Pacifica]</em> specifically reserved the question of \xe2\x80\x98an occasional expletive\xe2\x80\x99 and noted that it addressed only the \xe2\x80\x98particular broadcast\xe2\x80\x99 at issue in that case.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Remand Order</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 13308\xe2\x80\x9313309, \xc2\xb624.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These two sentences are not a summary of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s discussion about why it abandoned its prior understanding of <em>Pacifica</em>.  They <em>are </em>the discussion.  These 28 words (repeated in two opinions) do not acknowledge that an entirely different understanding of <em>Pacifica</em> underlay the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s earlier policy; they do not explain why the agency changed its mind about the line that <em>Pacifica </em>draws or its policy\xe2\x80\x99s relation to that line; and they tell us nothing at all about what happened to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s earlier determination to search for \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cless restrictive alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  They do not explain the transformation of what the FCC had long thought an insurmountable obstacle into an open door.  The result is not simply <em>Hamlet</em> without the prince, but <em>Hamlet</em> with a prince who, in mid-play and without explanation, just disappears.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have found one other related reference to <em>Pacifica</em>, but that reference occurs in an opinion written by a <em>dissenting</em> Commissioner.  That dissenter said that the FCC had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fail[ed] to address the many serious [constitutional] concerns raised\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by the new policy, while adding that the new policy was \xe2\x80\x9cnot the restrained enforcement policy encouraged by the Supreme Court in <em>Pacifica</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Remand Order, supra, </em>at 13331, 13334.  Neither that Commissioner in his dissent, nor I in this dissent, claim that agencies must always take account of possible constitutional issues when they formulate policy.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 12.  But the FCC works in the shadow of the First Amendment and its view of the application of that Amendment to \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletives\xe2\x80\x9d directly informed its initial policy choice.  Under these circumstances, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address this \xe2\x80\x9caspect\xe2\x80\x9d of the problem calls for a remand to the agency.  <em>Overton Park, </em>401 U. S.<em>, </em>at 420\xe2\x80\x93421.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the FCC failed to consider the potential impact of its new policy upon local broadcasting coverage.  This \xe2\x80\x9caspect of the problem\xe2\x80\x9d is particularly important because the FCC explicitly took account of potential broadcasting impact.  <em>Golden Globe Order, supra</em>, at 4980, \xc2\xb611 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ease with which broadcasters today can block even fleeting words in a live broadcast is an element in our decision\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, in setting forth \xe2\x80\x9cbleeping\xe2\x80\x9d technology changes (presumably lowering bleeping costs) as justifying the policy change, it implicitly reasoned that lower costs, making it easier for broadcasters to install bleeping equipment, made it less likely that the new policy would lead broadcasters to reduce coverage, say by canceling coverage of public events.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]echnological advances have made it possible \xe2\x80\xa6 to prevent the broadcast of a single offending word or action without blocking or disproportionately disrupting the message of the speaker or performer\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What then did the FCC say about the likelihood that smaller independent broadcasters, including many public service broadcasters, still would not be able to afford \xe2\x80\x9cbleeping\xe2\x80\x9d technology and, as a consequence, would reduce local coverage, indeed cancel coverage, of many public events?  It said nothing at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC cannot claim that local coverage lacks special importance.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9cthe concept of localism has been a cornerstone of broadcast regulation for decades.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Broadcast Localism</em>, 23 FCC Rcd. 1324, 1326, 1327, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63, 5 (2008).  That policy seeks to provide \xe2\x80\x9cviewers and listeners \xe2\x80\xa6 access to locally responsive programming including, but not limited to, local news and public affairs matter\xe2\x80\x9d and to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity in what is seen and heard over the airwaves.\xe2\x80\x9d  That policy has long favored local broadcasting, both as a means to increase coverage of local events and, insofar as it increases the number of broadcast voices, as an end in itself.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Reexamination of Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educ. Applicants</em>, 15 FCC Rcd. 7386, 7399, \xc2\xb629 (2000) (adopting a system for selecting applicants for broadcast channels that \xe2\x80\x9cwould foster our goal of broadcast diversity by enabling the local public to be served by differing \xe2\x80\xa6 licensees\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In re 2002 Biennial Regulatory Review</em>, 18 FCC Rcd. 13620, 13644, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb677, 79 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe remain firmly committed to the policy of promoting localism among broadcast outlets.  \xe2\x80\xa6 A \xe2\x80\xa6 measure of localism is the quantity and quality of local news and public affairs programming\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither can the FCC now claim that the impact of its new policy on local broadcasting is insignificant and obviously so.  Broadcasters tell us, as they told the FCC, the contrary.  See Brief for Former FCC Commissioners as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17\xe2\x80\x9319; App. 235\xe2\x80\x93237; Joint Comments of Fox Television Stations, Inc. et\xc2\xa0al., <em>In\xc2\xa0re Remand of Section III.B of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s March 15, 2006 Omnibus Order Resolving Numerous Broadcast Television Indecency Complaints</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9315, http://www.fcc.gov/DA06\xe2\x80\x931739/joint-networks.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 7, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  They told the FCC, for example, that the costs of bleeping/delay systems, up to $100,000 for installation and annual operation, place that technology beyond the financial reach of many smaller independent local stations.  See <em>id.</em>, at 14 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe significant equipment and personnel costs associated with installing, maintaining, and operating delay equipment sufficient to cover all live news, sports, and entertainment programs could conceivably exceed the net profits of a small local station for an entire year\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at App. XI.  And they ask what the FCC thinks will happen when a small local station without bleeping equipment wants to cover, say a local city council meeting, a high school football game, a dance contest at community center, or a Fourth of July parade.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relevant literature supports the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 financial claims.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ho, Taking No Chances, Austin American-Statesman, June 18, 2006, p. J1; Dotinga, Dirty-Word Filters Prove Costly, Wired.com, July 9, 2004, http://www.\nwired.com/entertainment/music/news/2004/07/64127; Stations, Cable Networks Finding Indecency Rules Expensive, Public Broadcasting Report, Aug. 4, 2006.  It also indicates that the networks with which some small stations are affiliated are not liable for the stations\xe2\x80\x99 local transmissions (unless the networks own them).  Ho, <em>supra</em>, at J1; Public Stations Fear Indecency Fine Jump Means Premium Hikes, Public Broadcasting Report, July 7, 2006.  The result is that smaller stations, fearing \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x9d fines of up to $325,000, may simply cut back on their coverage. See Romano, Reporting Live.  Very Carefully, Broadcasting &amp; Cable, July 4, 2005, p. 8; see also<em> ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid to take chances\xe2\x80\x9d of getting fined under the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s new policy, \xe2\x80\x9clocal broadcasters are responding by altering\xe2\x80\x94or halting altogether\xe2\x80\x94the one asset that makes local stations so valuable to their communities: live TV\xe2\x80\x9d); Daneman, WRUR Drops Its Live Radio Programs, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, May 27, 2004, p. 1B (reporting that a local broadcast station ceased broadcasting all local live programming altogether in response to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy change).  And there are many such smaller stations.

What did it say about the likely impact of the new policy on the coverage that its new policy is most likely to affect, coverage of <em>local</em> live events\xe2\x80\x94city council meetings, local sports events, community arts productions, and the like?  It said nothing at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality acknowledges that the Commission entirely failed to discuss this aspect of the regulatory problem.  But it sees \xe2\x80\x9cno need\xe2\x80\x9d for discussion in light of its, <em>i.e.</em>, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s, own \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9csmall-town broadcasters run a heightened risk of liability for indecent utterances\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of the change of policy.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  The plurality\'s \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt[s]\xe2\x80\x9d rest upon its views (1) that vulgar expression is less prevalent (at least among broadcast guests) in smaller towns, <em>ante</em>, at 24; (2) that the greatest risk the new policy poses for \xe2\x80\x9csmall-town broadcasters\xe2\x80\x9d arises when they broadcast local \xe2\x80\x9cnews and public affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., and (3) that the <em>Remand Order</em> says \xe2\x80\x9clittle about how the Commission would treat smaller broadcasters who cannot afford screening equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d while also pointing out that the new policy \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98does not \xe2\x80\xa6 impose undue burdens on broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and emphasizing that the case before it did not involve \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98breaking news.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first point, about the prevalence of vulgarity in small towns, I confess ignorance.  But I do know that there are independent stations in many large and medium sized cities.  See Television &amp; Cable Factbook, Directory of Television Stations in Operation 2008.  As to the second point, I too believe that coverage of local public events, if not news, lies at the heart of the problem.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot agree with the plurality, however, about the critical third point, namely that the new policy obviously provides smaller independent broadcasters with adequate assurance that they will not be fined.  The new policy removes the \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletive\xe2\x80\x9d exception, an exception that assured smaller independent stations that they would not be fined should someone swear at a public event.  In its place, it puts a policy that places all broadcasters at risk when they broadcast fleeting expletives, including expletives uttered at public events.  The <em>Remand Order</em> says that there \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>no outright news exemption from our indecency rules.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  21 FCC Rcd., at 13327, \xc2\xb671 (emphasis added).<em> </em>The best it can provide by way of assurance is to say that \xe2\x80\x9cit <em>may </em>be inequitable to hold a licensee responsible for airing offensive speech during live coverage of a public event <em>under some circumstances</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 13311, \xc2\xb633 (emphasis added).  It does list those circumstances as including the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of human error in using delay equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 13313, \xc2\xb635.  But it says <em>nothing </em>about a station\xe2\x80\x99s <em>inability to afford </em>delay equipment (a matter that in individual cases could itself prove debatable).  All the FCC had to do was to <em>consider </em>this matter and either grant an exemption or explain why it did not grant an exemption.  But it did not.  And the result is a rule that may well chill coverage\xe2\x80\x94the kind of consequence that the law has considered important for decades, to which the broadcasters pointed in their arguments before the FCC, and which the FCC nowhere discusses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dombrowski</em> v. <em>Pfister</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/index.html">380 U. S. 479</a>, 494 (1965) (\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one.  Even the prospect of ultimate failure of such prosecutions by no means dispels their chilling effect on protected expression\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U. S. 234</a>, 244 (2002); <em>Gibson</em> v. <em>Florida Legislative Investigation Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/539/index.html">372 U.

S. 183</a>, 195 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Had the FCC used traditional administrative notice-and-comment procedures, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553, the two failures I have just discussed would clearly require a court to vacate the resulting agency decision.  See <em>ACLU</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 823 F. 2d 1554, 1581 (CADC 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cNotice and comment rulemaking procedures obligate the FCC to respond to <em>all</em> significant comments, for the opportunity to comment is meaningless unless the agency responds to significant points raised by the public\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).  Here the agency did not make new policy through the medium of notice and comment proceedings.  But the same failures here\xe2\x80\x94where the policy is important, the significance of the issues clear, the failures near complete\xe2\x80\x94should lead us to the same conclusion.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s failure to discuss these two \xe2\x80\x9cimportant aspect[s] of the problem\xe2\x80\x9d means that the resulting decision is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d requiring us to remand the matter to the agency.  <em>State Farm, </em>463 U. S., at 43; <em>Overton Park, </em>401 U. S., at 416.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three reasons the FCC did set forth in support of its change of policy cannot make up for the failures I have discussed.  Consider each of them.  First, as I have pointed out, the FCC based its decision in part upon the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cbleeping/delay systems\xe2\x80\x9d technology has advanced.  I have already set forth my reasons for believing that that fact, without more, cannot provide a sufficient justification for its policy change.  <em>Supra, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the FCC says that the expletives here in question always invoke a coarse excretory or sexual image; hence it makes no sense to distinguish between whether one uses the relevant terms as an expletive or as a literal description.  The problem with this answer is that it does not help to justify the <em>change </em>in policy.  The FCC was aware of the coarseness of the \xe2\x80\x9cimage\xe2\x80\x9d the first time around.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Remand Order, </em>21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \xc2\xb623 (asserting that FCC has always understood the words as coarse and indecent).  And it explained the first time around why it nonetheless distinguished between their literal use and their use as fleeting expletives.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation, </em>69 F.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d<em>, </em>at 1254\xe2\x80\x931255, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb610\xe2\x80\x9311 (discussing First Amendment considerations and related need to avoid reduced broadcast coverage).  Simply to announce that the words, whether used descriptively or as expletives, call forth similar \xe2\x80\x9cimages\xe2\x80\x9d is not to address those reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the FCC said that \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cmost importan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d justification for the new policy lay in the fact that its new \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual\xe2\x80\x9d approach to fleeting expletives is better and more \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral approach to indecency\xe2\x80\x9d than was its previous \xe2\x80\x9ccategorica[l]\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which offered broadcasters virtual immunity for the broadcast of fleeting expletives.  <em>Remand Order</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 13308, \xc2\xb623.  This justification, however, offers no support for the change without an understanding of <em>why, i.e.</em>, <em>in what way, </em>the FCC considered the new approach better or more consistent with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s general approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General sets forth one way in which the new policy might be more consistent with statutory policy.  The indecency statute prohibits the broadcast of \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 indecent \xe2\x80\xa6 language.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464.  The very point of the statute, he says, is to eliminate nuisance; and the use of expletives, even once, can constitute such a nuisance.  The Solicitor General adds that the statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that Congress did not intend a safe-harbor for a fleeting use of that language.  Brief for Petitioners 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  The fatal flaw in this argument, however, lies in the fact that the Solicitor General and not the agency has made it.  We must consider the lawfulness of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the basis of the reasons the agency gave, not on the basis of those it <em>might have </em>given.  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/194/index.html">332 U. S. 194</a>, 196\xe2\x80\x93197 (1947); <em>State Farm, supra</em>, at 50.  And the FCC did not make this claim.  Hence, we cannot take it into account and need not evaluate its merits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the FCC found that the new policy was better in part because, in its view, the new policy better protects children against what it described as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the first blow\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of broadcast indecency that results from the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pervasive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d nature of broadcast media.  It wrote that its former policy of \xe2\x80\x9cgranting an automatic exemption for \xe2\x80\x98isolated or fleeting\xe2\x80\x99 expletives unfairly forces viewers (including children) to take \xe2\x80\x98the first blow.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Remand Order, supra</em>, at 13309, \xc2\xb625.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulty with this argument, however, is that it does not explain the <em>change.</em>  The FCC has long used the theory of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow\xe2\x80\x9d to justify its regulation of broadcast indecency.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Enforcement of Prohibitions Against Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464, </em>5 FCC Rcd. 5297, 5302, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb634\xe2\x80\x9335 (1990).  Yet the FCC has also long followed its original \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletives\xe2\x80\x9d policy.  Nor was the FCC ever unaware of the fact to which the majority points, namely that children\xe2\x80\x99s surroundings influence their behavior. See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In re Enforcement of Prohibitions Against Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464</em>, 8 FCC Rcd. 704, 706, \xc2\xb611 (1993).  So, to repeat the question: What, in respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow,\xe2\x80\x9d has changed?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC points to no empirical (or other) evidence to demonstrate that it previously understated the importance of avoiding the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow.\xe2\x80\x9d  Like the majority, I do not believe that an agency must always conduct full empirical studies of such matters.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But the FCC could have referred to, and explained, relevant empirical studies that suggest the contrary.  One review of the empirical evidence, for example, reports that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is doubtful that children under the age of 12 understand sexual language and innuendo; therefore it is unlikely that vulgarities have any negative effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kaye &amp; Sapolsky, Watch Your Mouth! An Analysis of Profanity Uttered by Children on Prime-Time Television, 2004 Mass Communication &amp; Soc\xe2\x80\x99y 429, 433 (Vol. 7) (citing two studies).  The Commission need not have accepted this conclusion.  But its failure to discuss this or any other such evidence, while providing no empirical evidence at all that favors its position, must weaken the logical force of its conclusion.  See <em>State Farm, </em>463 U. S.<em>, </em>at 43<em> </em>(explaining that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s failure to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine the relevant data\xe2\x80\x9d is a factor in determining whether the decision is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC also found the new policy better because it believed that its prior policy \xe2\x80\x9cwould as a matter of logic permit broadcasters to air expletives at all hours of a day so long as they did so one at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Remand Order, </em>21 FCC Rcd., at 13309, \xc2\xb625.  This statement, however, raises an obvious question: Did that happen?  The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s initial \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting expletives\xe2\x80\x9d policy was in effect for 25 years.  Had broadcasters during those 25 years aired a series of expletives \xe2\x80\x9cone at a time?\xe2\x80\x9d  If so, it should not be difficult to find evidence of that fact.  But the FCC refers to none.  Indeed, the FCC did not even claim that a change had taken place in this respect.  It spoke only of the pure \xe2\x80\x9clogic\xe2\x80\x9d of the initial policy \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting\xe2\x80\x9d such a practice.  That logic would have been apparent to anyone, including the FCC, in 1978 when the FCC set forth its initial policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the FCC made certain statements that suggest it did not believe it was changing prior policy in any major way.  It referred to that prior policy as based on \xe2\x80\x9cstaff letters and dicta\xe2\x80\x9d and it said that at least one of the instances before it (namely, the Cher broadcast) would have been actionably indecent under that prior policy.  <em>Id</em>., at 13306\xe2\x80\x9313307, 13324, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb620\xe2\x80\x9321, 60.  As we all agree, however, in fact the FCC did change its policy in a major way.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  To the extent that the FCC minimized that fact when considering the change, it did not fully focus on the fact of change.  And any such failure would make its decision still less supportable.  See <em>National Cable,</em> 545 U. S., at 981.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were the question a closer one, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance would nonetheless lead me to remand the case.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jin Fuey Moy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/241/394/index.html">241 U. S. 394</a>, 401 (1916) (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also <em>grave doubts</em> upon that score\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  That doctrine seeks to avoid unnecessary judicial consideration of constitutional questions, assumes that Congress, no less than the Judicial Branch, seeks to act within constitutional bounds, and thereby diminishes the friction between the branches that judicial holdings of unconstitutionality might otherwise generate.  See <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 237\xe2\x80\x93238 (1998); see also<em> Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U. S. 159</a>, 172\xe2\x80\x93173 (2001); <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988); <em>Rescue Army</em> v. <em>Municipal Court of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/549/index.html">331 U. S. 549</a>, 571 (1947); <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 345\xe2\x80\x93348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  The doctrine assumes that Congress would prefer a less-than-optimal interpretation of its statute to the grave risk of a constitutional holding that would set the statute entirely aside.  See <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 238 (construction of statute that avoids invalidation best reflects congressional will); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 249, 267 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the majority, I can find no convincing reason for refusing to apply a similar doctrine here.  The Court has often applied that doctrine where an agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulation relies on a plausible but constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Solid Waste Agency, supra</em>, at 172\xe2\x80\x93174; <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/490/index.html">440 U. S. 490</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93507 (1979).  The values the doctrine serves apply whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision does, or does not, rest upon a constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute.  And a remand here would do no more than ask the agency to reconsider its policy decision in light of the concerns raised in a judicial opinion.  Cf. <em>Fullilove</em> v. <em>Klutznick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/448/index.html">448 U. S. 448</a>, 551 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (a holding that a congressional action implicating the Equal Protection Clause \xe2\x80\x9cwas not adequately preceded by a consideration of less drastic alternatives or adequately explained by a statement of legislative purpose would be far less intrusive than a final determination that the substance of\xe2\x80\x9d that action was unconstitutional).  I would not now foreclose, as the majority forecloses, our further consideration of this matter.  (Of course, nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today prevents the Commission from reconsidering its current policy in light of potential constitutional considerations or for other reasons.)</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of its change leaves out two critically important matters underlying its earlier policy, namely <em>Pacifica </em>and local broadcasting coverage.  Its explanation rests upon three considerations previously known to the agency (\xe2\x80\x9ccoarseness,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst blow,\xe2\x80\x9d and running single expletives all day, one at a time).  With one exception, it provides no empirical or other information explaining why those considerations, which did not justify its new policy before, justify it now.  Its discussion of  the one exception (technological advances in bleeping/delay systems), failing to take account of local broadcast coverage, is seriously incomplete.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I need not decide whether one or two of these features, standing alone, would require us to remand the case.  Here all come together.  And taken together they suggest that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy change?\xe2\x80\x9d is, \xe2\x80\x9cWe like the new policy better.\xe2\x80\x9d  This kind of answer, might be perfectly satisfactory were it given by an elected official.  But when given by an agency, in respect to a major change of an important policy where much more might be said, it is not sufficient.  <em>State Farm, </em>463 U.

The monologue was aired as part of a program on contemporary attitudes toward the use of language.  <em>In re Citizen\xe2\x80\x99s Complaint Against Pacifica Foundation Station WBAI (FM)</em>, 56 F.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d 94, 95 (1975).

Apparently assuming that the Federal Communications Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (FCC or Commission) rulemaking authority is a species of executive power, the Court espouses the novel proposition that the Commission need not explain its decision to discard a longstanding rule in favor of a dramatically different approach to regulation.

As a landmark decision involving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made clear, however, when Congress grants rulemaking and adjudicative authority to an expert agency composed of commissioners selected through a bipartisan procedure and appointed for fixed terms, it substantially insulates the agency from executive control.  See <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/index.html">295 U.

No. 772, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1926), Congress established the FCC with the same measure of independence from the Executive that it had provided the FTC.  Just as the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s commissioners do not serve at the will of the President, see 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7154(c) (2000 ed.), its regulations are not subject to change at the President\xe2\x80\x99s will.  And when the Commission fashions rules that govern the airwaves, it exercises legislative power delegated to it by Congress.

But the FCC is constrained by its congressional mandate.  There should be a strong presumption that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s initial views, reflecting the informed judgment of independent commissioners with expertise in the regulated area, also reflect the views of the Congress that delegated the Commission authority to flesh out details not fully defined in the enacting statute.  The rules adopted after <em>Pacifica</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a>,<em> </em>have been in effect for decades and have not proved unworkable in the intervening years.  As Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explains, broadcasters have a substantial interest in regulatory stability; the threat of crippling financial penalties looms large over these entities.  See <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9314.<em> </em>The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s shifting and impermissibly vague indecency policy only imperils these broadcasters and muddles the regulatory landscape.  It therefore makes eminent sense to require the Commission to justify why its prior policy is no longer sound before allowing it to change course.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s congressional charter, 47 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71464, that would include any expletive that has a sexual or excretory origin.  Neither the opinion of the Court, nor Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion, adopted such a far-reaching interpretation.  Our holding was narrow in two critical respects.  First, we concluded, over the dissent of four Justices, that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cindecent\xe2\x80\x9d was not limited to material that had prurient appeal and instead included material that was in \xe2\x80\x9cnonconformance with accepted standards of morality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pacifica,</em> 438 U. S., at 740.  Second, we upheld the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication that a 12-minute, expletive-filled monologue by satiric humorist George Carlin was indecent \xe2\x80\x9cas broadcast.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 735.  We did not decide whether an <em>isolated</em> expletive could qualify as indecent.  <em>Id.</em>, at 750;<em> id.</em>, at 760\xe2\x80\x93761 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And we certainly did not hold that any word with a sexual or scatological origin, however used, was indecent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The narrow treatment of the term \xe2\x80\x9cindecent\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Pacifica </em>defined the outer boundaries of the enforcement policies adopted by the FCC in the ensuing years.  The Commission originally explained that \xe2\x80\x9cunder the legal standards set forth in <em>Pacifica</em>, deliberate and repetitive use [of expletives] in a patently offensive manner is a requisite to a finding of indecency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Pacifica Foundation</em>, 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \xc2\xb613 (1987).  While the \xe2\x80\x9crepetitive use\xe2\x80\x9d issue has received the most attention in this case, it should not be forgotten that <em>Pacifica </em>permitted the Commission to regulate only those words that describe sex or excrement.  See 438 U. S., at 743 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Commission\xe2\x80\x99s definition of indecency will deter only the broadcasting of patently offensive <em>references</em> to excretory and sexual organs and activities\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).<em> </em>The FCC minimizes the strength of this limitation by now claiming that any use of the words at issue in this case, in any context and in any form, <em>necessarily</em> describes sex or excrement.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002 and March 8, 2005</em>, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299, 13308, \xc2\xb623 (2006) <em>(Remand Order) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny strict dichotomy between expletives and descriptions or depictions of sexual or excretory functions is artificial and does not make sense in light of the fact that an expletive\xe2\x80\x99s power to offend derives from its sexual or excretory meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The customs of speech refute this claim: There is a critical distinction between the use of an expletive to describe a sexual or excretory function and the use of such a word for an entirely different purpose, such as to express an emotion.  One rests at the core of indecency; the other stands miles apart.  As any golfer who has watched his partner shank a short approach knows, it would be absurd to accept the suggestion that the resultant four-letter word uttered on the golf course describes sex or excrement and is therefore indecent.  But that is the absurdity the FCC has embraced in its new approach to indecency.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Complaints Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Globe Awards\xe2\x80\x9d Program, </em>19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4978\xe2\x80\x934979, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb68\xe2\x80\x939 (2004) (declaring that even the use of an expletive to emphasize happiness \xe2\x80\x9cinvariably invokes a coarse sexual image\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the words that concern the Court in this case <em>sometimes</em> retain their sexual or excretory meaning, there are surely countless instances in which they are used in a manner unrelated to their origin.  These words may not be polite, but that does not mean they are necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cindecent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71464.  By improperly equating the two, the Commission has adopted an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cindecency\xe2\x80\x9d that bears no resemblance to what <em>Pacifica</em> contemplated.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Most distressingly, the Commission appears to be entirely unaware of this fact, see <em>Remand Order, </em>21 FCC Rcd., at 13308 (erroneously referencing <em>Pacifica </em>in support of its new policy), and today\xe2\x80\x99s majority seems untroubled by this significant oversight, see <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Because the FCC has failed to demonstrate an awareness that it has ventured far beyond <em>Pacifica</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71464, its policy choice must be declared arbitrary and set aside as unlawful.
