[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  With these constitutional provisions in force, Congress, on the 25th of February, 1862, passed an act authorizing the issue of United States notes, which notes the act declared should be <em>"lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private,"</em> except duties on imports, and interest on the federal debt.</p>\n<p>In this state of things, as appeared from a case stated for the supreme court of New York, Meyer, plaintiff in that case, desiring to pay a bond and mortgage which he had assumed to pay, and which were held by Roosevelt, defendant in it, as original mortgagee, tendered to the latter the sum of $8,171, being the full amount of principal and interest, in notes of the United States, issued under the act of Congress aforesaid.  Roosevelt refused to receive the same as legal tender, and claimed that the repayment should be made in gold coin of the United States.
