The trial court denied his motions to suppress that evidence, and he was convicted of possession.  Affirming, the State Court of Appeal held that suspicionless searches of parolees are lawful under California law and that the search in this case was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it was not arbitrary, capricious, or harassing.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9ctotality of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d must be examined to determine whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Knights, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/112/index.html">534 U. S. 112</a>, 118.  Reasonableness \xe2\x80\x9cis determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93119.  Applying this approach in <em>Knights</em>, the Court found reasonable the warrantless search of a probationer\xe2\x80\x99s apartment based on reasonable suspicion and a probation condition authorized by California law.  In evaluating the degree of intrusion into Knights\xe2\x80\x99 privacy, the Court found his probationary status \xe2\x80\x9csalient,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 118, observing that probation is on a continuum of possible punishments and that probationers \xe2\x80\x9cdo not enjoy \xe2\x80\x98the absolute liberty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of other citizens, <em>id.,</em> at 119.  It also found probation searches necessary to promote legitimate governmental interests of integrating probationers back into the community, combating recidivism, and protecting potential victims.  Balancing those interests, the intrusion was reasonable.  However, because the search was predicated on both the probation search condition and reasonable suspicion, the Court did not address the reasonableness of a search solely predicated upon the probation condition.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Parolees, who are on the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuum\xe2\x80\x9d of state-imposed punishments, have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers, because parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe essence of parole is release from prison, before the completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner abides by certain rules during the balance of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morrissey</em> v. <em>Brewer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/index.html">408 U. S. 471</a>, 477.  California\xe2\x80\x99s system is consistent with these observations.  An inmate electing to complete his sentence out of physical custody remains in the Department of Corrections\xe2\x80\x99 legal custody for the remainder of his term and must comply with the terms and conditions of his parole.  The extent and reach of those conditions demonstrate that parolees have severely diminished privacy expectations by virtue of their status alone.  Additionally, as in <em>Knights,</em> the state law\xe2\x80\x99s parole search condition was clearly expressed to petitioner, who signed an order submitting to the condition and thus was unambiguously aware of it.  Examining the totality of the circumstances, petitioner did not have an expectation of privacy that society would recognize as legitimate.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interests, by contrast, are substantial.  A State has an \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming interest\xe2\x80\x9d in supervising parolees because they \xe2\x80\x9care more likely to commit future criminal offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole</em> v. <em>Scott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/357/index.html">524 U. S. 357</a>, 365.  Similarly, a State\xe2\x80\x99s interests in reducing recidivism, thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees, warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the Fourth Amendment.  The Amendment does not render States powerless to address these concerns effectively.  California\xe2\x80\x99s 60-to70-percent recidivism rate demonstrates that most parolees are ill prepared to handle the pressures of reintegration and require intense supervision.  The State Legislature has concluded that, given the State\xe2\x80\x99s number of parolees and its high recidivism rate, an individualized suspicion requirement would undermine the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders.  Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the fact that some States and the Federal Government require a level of individualized suspicion before searching a parolee is of little relevance in determining whether California\xe2\x80\x99s system is drawn to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s needs and is reasonable, taking into account a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s substantially diminished expectation of privacy.  Nor is there merit to the argument that California\xe2\x80\x99s law grants discretion without procedural safeguards.  The concern that the system gives officers unbridled discretion to conduct searches, thereby inflicting dignitary harms that arouse strong resentment in parolees and undermine their ability to reintegrate into society, is belied by the State\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on arbitrary, capricious, or harassing searches.  And petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the law frustrates reintegration efforts by permitting intrusions into the privacy interests of third persons is unavailing because that concern would arise under a suspicion-based system as well.

Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067(a) (West 2000).  We granted certiorari to decide whether a suspicionless search, conducted under the authority of this statute, violates the Constitution.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2002, petitioner Donald Curtis Samson was on state parole in California, following a conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm.  On September 6, 2002, Officer Alex Rohleder of the San Bruno Police Department observed petitioner walking down a street with a woman and a child.  Based on a prior contact with petitioner, Officer Rohleder was aware that petitioner was on parole and believed that he was facing an at large warrant.  Accordingly, Officer Rohleder stopped petitioner and asked him whether he had an outstanding parole warrant.  Petitioner responded that there was no outstanding warrant and that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas in good standing with his parole agent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 4.  Officer Rohleder confirmed, by radio dispatch, that petitioner was on parole and that he did not have an outstanding warrant.  Nevertheless, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067(a) (West 2000) and based solely on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s status as a parolee, Officer Rohleder searched petitioner.  During the search, Officer Rohleder found a cigarette box in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s left breast pocket.  Inside the box he found a plastic baggie containing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State charged petitioner with possession of methamphetamine pursuant to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa711377(a) (West 1991).  The trial court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress the methamphetamine evidence, finding that Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067(a) (West 2000) authorized the search and that the search was not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary or capricious.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (Proceedings on Motion to Supress).  A jury convicted petitioner of the possession charge and the trial court sentenced him to seven years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  Relying on <em>People</em> v. <em>Reyes</em>, 19 Cal. 4th 743, 968 P.\xc2\xa02d 445 (1998), the court held that suspicionless searches of parolees are lawful under California law; that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]uch a search is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment as long as it is not arbitrary, capricious or harassing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and that the search in this case was not arbitrary, capricious, or harassing. <em> </em>No. A102394 (Ct.

Whether a search is reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cis determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93119 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recently applied this approach in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Knights</em>.  In that case, California law required Knights, as a probationer, to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]ubmit his \xe2\x80\xa6 person, property, place of residence, vehicle, personal effects, to search anytime, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 114 (brackets in original).  Several days after Knights had been placed on probation, police suspected that he had been involved in several incidents of arson and vandalism.  Based upon that suspicion and pursuant to the search condition of his probation, a police officer conducted a warrantless search of Knights\xe2\x80\x99 apartment and found arson and drug paraphernalia.  <em>Id.,</em> at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concluded that the search of Knights\xe2\x80\x99 apartment was reasonable.  In evaluating the degree of intrusion into Knights\xe2\x80\x99 privacy, we found Knights\xe2\x80\x99 probationary status \xe2\x80\x9csalient,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 118, observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]robation is \xe2\x80\x98one point . . . on a continuum of possible punishments ranging from solitary confinement in a maximum-security facility to a few hours of mandatory community service.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 119 (quoting <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>Wisconsin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/868/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/868/index.html">483 U. S. 868</a>, 874 (1987)).  Cf. <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Palmer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/517/index.html"></a><a href="/us/468/517/index.html">468 U. S. 517</a>, 530 (1984) (holding that prisoners have no reasonable expectation of privacy).  We further observed that, by virtue of their status alone, probationers \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98do not enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cthe absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Knights</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 119 (quoting <em>Griffin, supra,</em> at 874, in turn quoting <em>Morrissey</em> v. <em>Brewer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/471/index.html">408 U. S. 471</a>, 480 (1972)), justifying the \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ition] [of] reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by law-abiding citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knights</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 119.  We also considered the facts that Knights\xe2\x80\x99 probation order clearly set out the probation search condition, and that Knights was clearly informed of the condition.  See <em>Knights</em>,<em> </em>534 U. S., at 119.  We concluded that under these circumstances, Knights\xe2\x80\x99 expectation of privacy was significantly diminished.  See <em>id.,</em> at 119\xe2\x80\x93120.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also concluded that probation searches, such as the search of Knights\xe2\x80\x99 apartment, are necessary to the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Noting the State\xe2\x80\x99s dual interest in integrating probationers back into the community and combating recidivism, see <em>id.,</em> at 120\xe2\x80\x93121, we credited the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assumption\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that, by virtue of his status, a probationer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 120 (quoting <em>Griffin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 880).  We further found that \xe2\x80\x9cprobationers have even more of an incentive to conceal their criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because probationers are aware that they may be subject to supervision and face revocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, do not apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knights</em>, 534 U. S., at 120.  We explained that the State did not have to ignore the reality of recidivism or suppress its interests in \xe2\x80\x9cprotecting potential victims of criminal enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d for fear of running afoul of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Balancing these interests, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer\xe2\x80\x99s significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the search at issue in <em>Knights</em> was predicated on both the probation search condition and reasonable suspicion, we did not reach the question whether the search would have been reasonable under the Fourth Amendment had it been  solely predicated upon the condition of probation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 120, n. 6.  Our attention is directed to that question today, albeit in the context of a parolee search.</p>\n<p align="left">III </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we noted in <em>Knights,</em> parolees are on the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuum\xe2\x80\x9d of state-imposed punishments.  <em>Id.,</em> at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted).  On this continuum, parolees have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers, because parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is to imprisonment.  As this Court has pointed out<em>,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cparole is an established variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The essence of parole is release from prison, before the completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner abides by certain rules during the balance of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morrissey,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 477.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn most cases, the State is willing to extend parole only because it is able to condition it upon compliance with certain requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole</em> v. <em>Scott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/357/index.html">524 U. S. 357</a>, 365 (1998).  See also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reyes</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 446, 461 (CA2 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal supervised release, \xe2\x80\xa6 in contrast to probation, is meted out in addition to, not in lieu of, incarceration\xe2\x80\x9d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cardona</em>, 903 F.\xc2\xa02d 60, 63 (CA1 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]n the Court\xe2\x80\x99s continuum of possible punishments, parole is the stronger medicine; ergo, parolees enjoy even less of the average citizen\xe2\x80\x99s absolute liberty than do probationers\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s system of parole is consistent with these observations: A California inmate may serve his parole period either in physical custody, or elect to complete his sentence out of physical custody and subject to certain conditions.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73060.5 (West 2000).  Under the latter option, an inmate-turned-parolee remains in the legal custody of the California Department of Corrections through the remainder of his term, \xc2\xa73056, and must comply with all of the terms and conditions of parole, including mandatory drug tests, restrictions on association with felons or gang members, and mandatory meetings with parole officers, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \xc2\xa72512 (2005); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067 (West 2000).  See also <em>Morrissey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 478 (discussing other permissible terms and conditions of parole).  General conditions of parole also require a parolee to report to his assigned parole officer immediately upon release, inform the parole officer within 72 hours of any change in employment status, request permission to travel a distance of more than 50 miles from the parolee\xe2\x80\x99s home, and refrain from criminal conduct and possession of firearms, specified weapons, or knives unrelated to employment.  Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \xc2\xa72512.  Parolees may also be subject to special conditions, including psychiatric treatment programs, mandatory abstinence from alcohol, residence approval, and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other condition deemed necessary by the Board [of Parole Hearings] or the Department [of Corrections and Rehabilitation] due to unusual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72513.  The extent and reach of these conditions clearly demonstrate that parolees like petitioner have severely diminished expectations of privacy by virtue of their status alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, as we found \xe2\x80\x9csalient\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Knights</em> with respect to the probation search condition, the parole search condition under California law\xe2\x80\x94requiring inmates who opt for parole to submit to suspicionless searches by a parole officer or other peace officer \xe2\x80\x9cat any time,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067(a) (West 2000)\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly expressed\xe2\x80\x9d to petitioner.  <em>Knights</em>, 534 U. S., at 119.  He signed an order submitting to the condition and thus was \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously\xe2\x80\x9d aware of it.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Knights</em>, we found that acceptance of a clear and unambiguous search condition \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly diminished Knights\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 120.  Examining the totality of the circumstances pertaining to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s status as a parolee, \xe2\x80\x9can established variation on imprisonment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Morrissey,</em> 408 U. S., at 477, including the plain terms of the parole search condition, we conclude that petitioner did not have an expectation of privacy that society would recognize as legitimate.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s interests, by contrast, are substantial.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that a State has an \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming interest\xe2\x80\x9d in supervising parolees because \xe2\x80\x9cparolees\xe2\x80\xa6 are more likely to commit future criminal offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole,</em> 524 U. S., at 365 (explaining that the interest in combating recidivism \xe2\x80\x9cis the very premise behind the system of close parole supervision\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that a State\xe2\x80\x99s interests in reducing recidivism and thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the Fourth Amendment.  See <em>Griffin</em>, 483 U. S., at 879; <em>Knights</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The empirical evidence presented in this case clearly demonstrates the significance of these interests to the State of California.  As of November 30, 2005, California had over 130,000 released parolees.  California\xe2\x80\x99s parolee population has a 68-to-70 percent recidivism rate.  See California Attorney General, Crime in California 37 (Apr. 2001) (explaining that 68 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison, 55 percent for a parole violation, 13 percent for the commission of a new felony offense); J. Petersilia, Challenges of Prisoner Reentry and Parole in California, 12 California Policy Research Center Brief, p. 2 (June 2000), available at http://www.ucop.edu/cprc/parole.pdf (as visited June 15, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (\xe2\x80\x9c70% of the state\xe2\x80\x99s paroled felons reoffend within 18 months\xe2\x80\x94the highest recidivism rate in the nation\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has acknowledged the grave safety concerns that attend recidivism.  See <em>Ewing</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/11/index.html">538 U. S. 11</a>, 26 (2003) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cRecidivism is a serious public safety concern in California and throughout the Nation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we made clear in <em>Knights</em>, the Fourth Amendment does not render the States powerless to address these concerns <em>effectively</em>.  See 534 U. S., at 121.  Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention, California\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct suspicionless searches of parolees serves its interest in reducing recidivism, in a manner that aids, rather than hinders, the reintegration of parolees into productive society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In California, an eligible inmate serving a determinate sentence may elect parole when the actual days he has served plus statutory time credits equal the term imposed by the trial court, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72931, 2933, 3000(b)(1) (West 2000), irrespective of whether the inmate is capable of integrating himself back into productive society.  As the recidivism rate demonstrates, most parolees are ill prepared to handle the pressures of reintegration.  Thus, most parolees require intense supervision.  The California Legislature has concluded that, given the number of inmates the State paroles and its high recidivism rate, a requirement that searches be based on individualized suspicion would undermine the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders.  This conclusion makes eminent sense.  Imposing a reasonable suspicion requirement, as urged by petitioner, would give parolees greater opportunity to anticipate searches and conceal criminality.  See <em>Knights</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 120; <em>Griffin</em>, 483 U. S., at 879.  This Court concluded that the incentive-to-conceal concern justified an \xe2\x80\x9cintensive\xe2\x80\x9d system for supervising probationers in <em>Griffin</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 875.  That concern applies with even greater force to a system of supervising parolees.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reyes</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 461 (observing that the <em>Griffin</em> rationale \xe2\x80\x9cappl[ies] <em>a fortiori</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cfederal supervised release, which, in contrast to probation, is \xe2\x80\x98meted out in addition to, not in lieu of, incareration\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Crawford</em>, 372 F. 3d 1048, 1077 (CA9 2004) (en banc) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (explaining that parolees, in contrast to probationers, \xe2\x80\x9chave been sentenced to prison for felonies and released before the end of their prison terms\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to have acted more harmfully than anyone except those felons not released on parole\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hudson</em>, 468 U. S., at 526 (persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment have been \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to have acted more harmfully than anyone except those felons not released on parole\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 529 (observing that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cnaive\xe2\x80\x9d to institute a system of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98planned random searches\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as that would allow prisoners to \xe2\x80\x9canticipate\xe2\x80\x9d searches, thus defeating the purpose of random searches).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner observes that the majority of States and the Federal Government have been able to further similar interests in reducing recidivism and promoting re-integration, despite having systems that permit parolee searches based upon some level of suspicion.  Thus, petitioner contends, California\xe2\x80\x99s system is constitutionally defective by comparison.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the practices of jurisdictions other than California, however, is misplaced.  That some States and the Federal Government require a level of individualized suspicion is of little relevance to our determination whether California\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory system is drawn to meet its needs and is reasonable, taking into account a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s substantially diminished expectation of privacy.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there merit to the argument that California\xe2\x80\x99s parole search law permits \xe2\x80\x9ca blanket grant of discretion untethered by any procedural safeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The concern that California\xe2\x80\x99s suspicionless search system gives officers unbridled discretion to conduct searches, thereby inflicting dignitary harms that arouse strong resentment in parolees and undermine their ability to reintegrate into productive society, is belied by California\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious or harassing\xe2\x80\x9d searches.  See <em>Reyes</em>, 19 Cal. 4th, at 752, 753\xe2\x80\x93754, 968 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 450, 451; <em>People</em> v. <em>Bravo</em>, 43 Cal. 3d 600, 610, 738 P.\xc2\xa02d 336, 342 (1987) (probation); see also Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73067(d) (West 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the intent of the Legislature to authorize law enforcement officers to conduct searches for the sole purpose of harassment\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that parolees under California law are subject to capricious searches conducted at the unchecked \xe2\x80\x9cwhim\xe2\x80\x9d of law enforcement officers, <em>post</em>, at 3, 4, ignores this prohibition.  Likewise, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concern that California\xe2\x80\x99s suspicionless search law frustrates reintegration efforts by permitting intrusions into the privacy interests of third parties is also unavailing because that concern would arise under a suspicion-based regime as well.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, we conclude that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee.

See <em>post</em>, at 5 (opinion of Stevens,\xc2\xa0J.).  That view misperceives our holding.  If that were the basis of our holding, then this case would have been resolved solely under <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Palmer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/517/index.html"></a><a href="/us/468/517/index.html">468 U.

Nor is our rationale inconsistent with <em>Morrissey</em> v. <em>Brewer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/471/index.html">408 U. S. 471</a>, 482 (1972).  In that case, the Court recognized that restrictions on a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s liberty are not unqualified.  That statement, even if accepted as a truism, sheds no light on the extent to which a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights are indeed limited\xe2\x80\x94and no one argues that a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights are not limited.  <em>Morrissey</em> itself does not cast doubt on today\xe2\x80\x99s holding given that the liberty at issue in that case\xe2\x80\x94the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process right to a hearing before revocation of parole\xe2\x80\x94invokes wholly different analysis than the search at issue here.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because we find that the search at issue here is reasonable under our general Fourth Amendment approach, we need not reach the issue whether \xe2\x80\x9cacceptance of the search condition constituted consent in the <em>Schneckloth </em>[v. <em>Bustamonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U.

The California Court of Appeal has, and it has concluded that, under \xc2\xa73067(b), \xe2\x80\x9cinmates who are otherwise eligible for parole yet refuse to agree to the mandatory search condition will remain imprisoned \xe2\x80\xa6 until either the inmate (1) agrees to the search condition and is otherwise eligible for parole or (2) has lost all worktime credits and is eligible for release after having served the balance of his/her sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People </em>v.<em> Middleton</em>, 131 Cal.

That simply is not the case.  The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, not individualized suspicion.  Thus, while this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence has often recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cto accommodate public and private interests some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/index.html">428 U.

Therefore, although this Court has only sanctioned suspicionless searches in limited circumstances, namely programmatic and special needs searches, we have never held that these are the only limited circumstances in which searches absent individualized suspicion could be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fourth Amendment.  In light of California\xe2\x80\x99s earnest concerns respecting recidivism, public safety, and reintegration of parolees into productive society, and because the object of the Fourth Amendment is <em>reasonableness</em>, our decision today is far from remarkable.

The protection is not as robust as that afforded to ordinary citizens; we have held that probationers\xe2\x80\x99 lowered expectation of privacy may justify their warrantless search upon reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Knights, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/112/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/112/index.html">534 U.

We have also recognized that the supervisory responsibilities of probation officers, who are required to provide \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98individualized counseling\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to monitor their charges\xe2\x80\x99 progress, <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>Wisconsin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/868/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/868/index.html">483 U.

See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate, neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen\xe2\x80\x9d).  But neither <em>Knights</em> nor <em>Griffin</em> supports a regime of suspicionless searches, conducted pursuant to a blanket grant of discretion untethered by any procedural safeguards, by law enforcement personnel who have no special interest in the welfare of the parolee or probationer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What the Court sanctions today is an unprecedented curtailment of liberty.  Combining faulty syllogism with circular reasoning, the Court concludes that parolees have no more legitimate an expectation of privacy in their persons than do prisoners.  However superficially appealing that parity in treatment may seem, it runs roughshod over our precedent.  It also rests on an intuition that fares poorly under scrutiny.  And once one acknowledges that parolees do have legitimate expectations of privacy beyond those of prisoners, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence does not permit the conclusion, reached by the Court here for the first time, that a search supported by neither individualized suspicion nor \xe2\x80\x9cspecial needs\xe2\x80\x9d is nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The suspicionless search is the very evil the Fourth Amendment was intended to stamp out.  See <em>Boyd</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/index.html">116 U. S. 616</a>, 625\xe2\x80\x93630 (1886); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Indianapolis</em> v. <em>Edmond,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/32/index.html">531 U. S. 32</a>, 37 (2000).  The pre-Revolutionary \xe2\x80\x9cwrits of assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d which permitted roving searches for contraband, were reviled precisely because they \xe2\x80\x9cplaced \xe2\x80\x98the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyd,</em> 116 U.

Although the Court has in the past relied on special needs to uphold warrantless searches of probationers, <em>id.</em>, at 873, 880, it has never gone so far as to hold that a probationer or parolee may be subjected to full search at the whim of any law enforcement officer he happens to encounter, whether or not the officer has reason to suspect him of wrongdoing.  <em>Griffin</em>, after all, involved a search <em>by a probation officer</em> that was supported by <em>reasonable suspicion</em>.  The special role of probation officers was critical to the analysis; \xe2\x80\x9cwe deal with a situation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cin which there is an ongoing supervisory relationship\xe2\x80\x94and one that is not, or at least not entirely, adversarial\xe2\x80\x94between the object of the search and the decisionmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 879.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest or \xe2\x80\x9cspecial need,\xe2\x80\x9d as articulated in <em>Griffin</em>, was an interest in supervising the wayward probationer\xe2\x80\x99s reintegration into society\xe2\x80\x94not, or at least not principally, the general law enforcement goal of detecting crime, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no accident, then, that when we later upheld the search of a probationer <em>by a law enforcement officer </em>(again, based on reasonable suspicion), we forwent any reliance on the special needs doctrine.  See <em>Knights, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/112/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/112/index.html">534 U. S. 112</a>.

And it goes further: In special needs cases we have at least insisted upon programmatic safeguards designed to ensure evenhandedness in application; if individualized suspicion is to be jettisoned, it must be replaced with measures to protect against the state actor\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered discretion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html">440 U.

Coupling the dubious holding of <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Palmer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/517/index.html">468 U. S. 517</a> (1984), with the bald statement that \xe2\x80\x9cparolees have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5, the Court two-steps its way through a faulty syllogism and, thus, avoids the application of Fourth Amendment principles altogether.  The logic, apparently, is this: Prisoners have no legitimate expectation of privacy; parolees are like prisoners; therefore, parolees have no legitimate expectation of privacy.  The conclusion is remarkable not least because we have long embraced its opposite.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It also rests on false premises.  First, it is simply not true that a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s status, vis-\xc3\x80-vis either the State or the Constitution, is tantamount to that of a prisoner or even materially distinct from that of a probationer.  See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/471/index.html">408 U. S. 471</a>, 482 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9cThough the State properly subjects [a parolee] to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison\xe2\x80\x9d).  A parolee, like a probationer, is set free in the world subject to restrictions intended to facilitate supervision and guard against antisocial behavior.  As with probation, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State is willing to extend parole only because it is able to condition it upon compliance with certain requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole</em> v. <em>Scott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/357/index.html">524 U. S. 357</a>, 365 (1998).  Certainly, parole differs from probation insofar as parole is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98meted out in addition to, not in lieu of, incarceration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reyes</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 446, 461 (CA2 2002)).  And, certainly, parolees typically will have committed more serious crimes\xe2\x80\x94ones warranting a prior term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94than probationers.  The latter distinction, perhaps, would support the conclusion that a State has a stronger interest in supervising parolees than it does in supervising probationers.  But see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 373, 376, n.\xc2\xa01 (CA3 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]here is no constitutional difference between probation and parole for purposes of the [F]ourth [A]mendment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But why either distinction should result in refusal to acknowledge as legitimate, when harbored by parolees, the same expectation of privacy that probationers reasonably may harbor is beyond fathom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the notion that a parolee legitimately expects only so much privacy as a prisoner is utterly without foundation.  <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer</em> does stand for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms\xe2\x80\x9d is denied individuals who are incarcerated.  468 U. S., at 527.  But this is because it \xe2\x80\x9cis necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad of \xe2\x80\x98institutional needs and objectives\xe2\x80\x99 of prison facilities, \xe2\x80\xa6 chief among which is internal security.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 524; see <em>id.</em>, at 538 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cI agree that the government\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest in prison safety, together with the necessarily ad\xc2\xa0hoc judgments required of prison officials, make prison cell searches and seizures appropriate for categorical treatment\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]); see also <em>Treasury Employees</em> v. <em>Von Raab,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/656/index.html">489 U. S. 656</a>, 680 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  These \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional needs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94safety of inmates and guards, \xe2\x80\x9cinternal order,\xe2\x80\x9d and sanitation, <em>Hudson</em>, 468 U. S., at 527\xe2\x80\x93528\xe2\x80\x94manifestly do not apply to parolees.  As discussed above and in <em>Griffin</em>, <em>other</em> state interests may warrant certain intrusions into a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, but <em>Hudson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale cannot be mapped blindly onto the situation with which we are presented in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it enough, in deciding whether someone\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy is \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate,\xe2\x80\x9d to rely on the existence of the offending condition or the individual\xe2\x80\x99s notice thereof.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 7.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in this respect is entirely circular.  The mere fact that a particular State refuses to acknowledge a parolee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy interest cannot mean that a parolee in that State has no expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as legitimate\xe2\x80\x94especially when the measure that invades privacy is both the <em>subject</em> of the Fourth Amendment challenge and a clear outlier.  With only one or two arguable exceptions, neither the Federal Government nor any other State subjects parolees to searches of the kind to which petitioner was subjected.  And the fact of notice hardly cures the circularity; the loss of a subjective expectation of privacy would play \xe2\x80\x9cno meaningful role\xe2\x80\x9d in analyzing the legitimacy of expectations, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/735/index.html">442 U. S. 735</a>, 740\xe2\x80\x93741, n. 5 (1979).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Threaded through the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is the suggestion that deprivation of Fourth Amendment rights is part and parcel of any convict\xe2\x80\x99s punishment.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  If a person may be subject to random and suspicionless searches in prison, the Court seems to assume, then he cannot complain when he is subject to the same invasion outside of prison, so long as the State still <em>can</em> imprison him.  Punishment, though, is not the basis on which <em>Hudson</em> was decided.  (Indeed, it is settled that a prison inmate \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98retains those [constitutional] rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a>, 95 (1987).)  Nor, to my knowledge, have we ever sanctioned the use of any search as a punitive measure.  Instead, the question in every case must be whether the balance of legitimate expectations of privacy, on the one hand, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests in conducting the relevant search, on the other, justifies dispensing with the warrant and probable-cause requirements that are otherwise dictated by the Fourth Amendment.  That balance is not the same in prison as it is out.  We held in <em>Knights</em>\xe2\x80\x94without recourse to <em>Hudson</em>\xe2\x80\x94that the balance favored allowing the State to conduct searches based on reasonable suspicion.  Never before have we plunged below that floor absent a demonstration of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial needs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Had the State imposed as a condition of parole a requirement that petitioner submit to random searches by his parole officer, who is \xe2\x80\x9csupposed to have in mind the welfare of the [parolee]\xe2\x80\x9d and guide the parolee\xe2\x80\x99s transition back into society, <em>Griffin</em>, 483 U. S., at 876\xe2\x80\x93877, the condition might have been justified either under the special needs doctrine or because at least part of the requisite \xe2\x80\x9creasonable suspicion\xe2\x80\x9d is supplied in this context by the individual-specific knowledge gained through the supervisory relationship.  See <em>id.</em>, at 879 (emphasizing probation office\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9cassess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of [the probationer\xe2\x80\x99s] life, character, and circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, this might have been a different case had a court or parole board imposed the condition at issue based on specific knowledge of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history and projected likelihood of reoffending, or if the State had had in place programmatic safeguards to ensure evenhandedness.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Under either of those scenarios, the State would at least have gone some way toward averting the greatest mischief wrought by officials\xe2\x80\x99 unfettered discretion.  But the search condition here is imposed on <em>all</em> parolees\xe2\x80\x94whatever the nature of their crimes, whatever their likelihood of recidivism, and whatever their supervisory needs\xe2\x80\x94without any programmatic procedural protections.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court seems to acknowledge that unreasonable searches \xe2\x80\x9cinflic[t] dignitary harms that arouse strong resentment in parolees and undermine their ability to reintegrate into productive society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11; see <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a>, 19, 29 (1968).  It is satisfied, however, that the California courts\xe2\x80\x99 prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arbitrary, capricious or harassing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d searches suffices to avert those harms\xe2\x80\x94which are of course counterproductive to the State\xe2\x80\x99s purported aim of rehabilitating former prisoners and reintegrating them into society.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11 (citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes</em>, 19 Cal. 4th 743, 968 P.\xc2\xa02d 445 (1998)).  I am unpersuaded.  The requirement of individualized suspicion, in all its iterations, is the shield the Framers selected to guard against the evils of arbitrary action, caprice, and harassment.  To say that those evils may be averted without that shield is, I fear, to pay lipservice to the end while withdrawing the means.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As we observed in <em>Ferguson</em> v. <em>Charleston,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/67/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/67/index.html">532 U.

But at least the State in <em>Griffin</em> could in good faith contend that its warrantless searches were supported by a special need conceptually distinct from law enforcement goals generally.  Indeed, that a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in supervising its parolees and probationers to ensure their smooth reintegration may occasionally diverge from its general law enforcement aims is illustrated by this very case.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s possession of a small amount of illegal drugs would not have been grounds for revocation of his parole.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73063.1(a) (West Supp. 2006).  Presumably, the California Legislature determined that it is unnecessary and perhaps even counterproductive, as a means of furthering the goals of the parole system, to reincarcerate former prisoners for simple possession.  The general law enforcement interests the State espouses, by contrast, call for reincarceration.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Morrissey</em> v. <em>Brewer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/471/index.html">408 U.
