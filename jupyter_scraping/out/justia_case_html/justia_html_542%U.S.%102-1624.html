Argued March 24, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner school district requires each elementary school class to recite daily the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s daughter participates in this exercise.  Newdow, an atheist, filed suit alleging that, because the Pledge contains the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d it constitutes religious indoctrination of his child in violation of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.  He also alleged that he had standing to sue on his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter as \xe2\x80\x9cnext friend.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Magistrate Judge concluded that the Pledge is constitutional, and the District Court agreed and dismissed the complaint.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s religious education, and that the school district\xe2\x80\x99s policy violates the Establishment Clause.  Sandra Banning, the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother, then filed a motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring, <em>inter alia</em>, that she had exclusive legal custody under a state-court order and that, as her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sole legal custodian, she felt it was not in the child\xe2\x80\x99s interest to be a party to Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Concluding that Banning\xe2\x80\x99s sole legal custody did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child, the Ninth Circuit held that, under California law, Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if they contradict her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, as well as the right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because California law deprives Newdow of the right to sue as next friend, he lacks prudential standing to challenge the school district\xe2\x80\x99s policy in federal court.  The standing requirement derives from the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary.  <em>E.g., Allen</em> v. <em>Wright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U. S. 737</a>, 750.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s prudential standing jurisprudence encompasses, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe general prohibition on a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s raising another person\xe2\x80\x99s legal rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 751, and the Court generally declines to intervene in domestic relations, a traditional subject of state law, <em>e.g., In re Burrus,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/136/586/index.html">136 U. S. 586</a>, 593\xe2\x80\x93594.  The extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until Banning filed her motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring that the family court order gave her \xe2\x80\x9c<em>sole</em> legal custody\xe2\x80\x9d and authorized her to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise legal control\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d over her daughter.  Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he nevertheless retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter his beliefs fails because his rights cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case also concerns Banning\xe2\x80\x99s rights under the custody orders and, most important, their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s interests upon finding herself at the center of a highly public debate.  Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.  Their interests are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.  Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s parental status is defined by state law, and this Court customarily defers to the state-law interpretations of the regional federal court, see <em>Bishop</em> v. <em>Wood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/index.html">426 U. S. 341</a>, 346\xe2\x80\x93347.  Here, the Ninth Circuit relied on intermediate state appellate cases recognizing the right of each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.  Nothing that either Banning or the school board has done, however, impairs Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, he requests the more ambitious relief of forestalling his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to religious ideas endorsed by her mother, who wields a form of veto power, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the family court\xe2\x80\x99s order has deprived Newdow of that status.

V. NEWDOW<br/> 542 U. S. 1 (2004)<br/> <br/> SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/> NO. 02-1624<br/> </strong><br/> <p style="text-align: left;">ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT and DAVID W. GORDON, SUPERINTENDENT, PETITIONERS <em>v.</em> MICHAEL A. NEWDOW et\xc2\xa0al.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p> <p style="text-align: left;">[June 14, 2004]</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d he views the School District\xe2\x80\x99s policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the First Amendment.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the First Amendment issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our country,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/index.html">491 U. S. 397</a>, 405 (1989), and of its proud traditions \xe2\x80\x9cof freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  As its history illustrates, the Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgement of the ideals that our flag symbolizes.  Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pledge of Allegiance was initially conceived more than a century ago.  As part of the nationwide interest in commemorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\xe2\x80\x99 discovery of America, a widely circulated national magazine for youth proposed in 1892 that pupils recite the following affirmation: \xe2\x80\x9cI pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, the National Flag Conferences replaced the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmy Flag\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe flag of the United States of America.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1942, in the midst of World War II, Congress adopted, and the President signed, a Joint Resolution codifying a detailed set of \xe2\x80\x9crules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chapter 435, 56 Stat. 377.  Section 7 of this codification provided in full:</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xe2\x80\x9cThat the pledge of allegiance to the flag, \xe2\x80\x98I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\xe2\x80\x99, be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words \xe2\x80\x98to the flag\xe2\x80\x99 and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.  However, civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the pledge is given by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress.  Persons in uniform shall render the military salute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 380.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> This resolution, which marked the first appearance of the Pledge of Allegiance in positive law, confirmed the importance of the flag as a symbol of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s indivisibility and commitment to the concept of liberty.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress revisited the Pledge of Allegiance 12 years later when it amended the text to add the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 14, 1954, ch. 297, 68 Stat. 249.  The House Report that accompanied the legislation observed that, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2 (1954).  The resulting text is the Pledge as we know it today: \xe2\x80\x9cI pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">II</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under California law, \xe2\x80\x9cevery public elementary school\xe2\x80\x9d must begin each day with \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate patriotic exercises.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa752720 (West 1989).  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d this requirement.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Elk Grove Unified School District has implemented the state law by requiring that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach elementary school class recite the pledge of allegiance to the flag once each day.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2">Footnote 2</a>]  Consistent with our case law, the School District permits students who object on religious grounds to abstain from the recitation.  See <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a> (1943).</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2000, Newdow filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against the United States Congress, the President of the United States, the State of California, and the Elk Grove Unified School District and its superintendent.[<a href="#F3">Footnote 3</a>]  App. 24.  At the time of filing, Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was enrolled in kindergarten in the Elk Grove Unified School District and participated in the daily recitation of the Pledge.  Styled as a mandamus action, the complaint explains that Newdow is an atheist who was ordained more than 20 years ago in a ministry that \xe2\x80\x9cespouses the religious philosophy that the true and eternal bonds of righteousness and virtue stem from reason rather than mythology.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 42, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xa053.  The complaint seeks a declaration that the 1954 Act\xe2\x80\x99s addition of the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the United States Constitution,[<a href="#F4">Footnote 4</a>] as well as an injunction against the School District\xe2\x80\x99s policy requiring daily recitation of the Pledge.  <em>Id</em>., at 42.  It alleges that Newdow has standing to sue on his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter as \xe2\x80\x9cnext friend.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 26, 56.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge, whose brief findings and recommendation concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Pledge does not violate the Establishment Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 79.  The District Court adopted that recommendation and dismissed the complaint on July 21, 2000.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 97.  The Court of Appeals reversed and issued three separate decisions discussing the merits and Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its first opinion the appeals court unanimously held that Newdow has standing \xe2\x80\x9cas a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newdow</em> v. <em>U. S. Congress</em>, 292 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 602 (CA9 2002) <em>(Newdow I)</em>.  That holding sustained Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing to challenge not only the policy of the School District, where his daughter still is enrolled, but also the 1954 Act of Congress that had amended the Pledge, because his \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98injury in fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fairly traceable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to its enactment.  <em>Id</em>., at 603\xe2\x80\x93605.  On the merits, over the dissent of one judge, the court held that both the 1954 Act and the School District\xe2\x80\x99s policy violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  <em>Id</em>., at 612.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared \xe2\x80\x9cphysical custody\xe2\x80\x9d of their daughter, a state-court order granted her \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive legal custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the child, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding the sole right to represent [the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education\xe2\x80\x9d and welfare.  <em>Id</em>., at 82, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x933.  Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God.  <em>Id</em>., at 83, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xa04.  Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her father\xe2\x80\x99s atheist views.  <em>Id</em>., at 85, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xa010.  Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sole legal custodian, that it was not in the child\xe2\x80\x99s interest to be a party to Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit.  <em>Id</em>., at 86.  On September 25, 2002, the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed party or suing as her \xe2\x80\x9cnext friend.\xe2\x80\x9d  That order did not purport to answer the question of Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s Article III standing.  See <em>Newdow</em> v. <em>U. S. Congress</em>, 313 F.\xc2\xa03d 500, 502 (CA9 2002) <em>(Newdow II)</em>.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing in light of Banning\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but unanimously concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe grant of sole legal custody to Banning\xe2\x80\x9d did not deprive Newdow, \xe2\x80\x9cas a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 502\xe2\x80\x93503.  The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradict the mother\xe2\x80\x99s, and that Banning\xe2\x80\x99s objections as sole legal custodian do not defeat Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.  <em>Id</em>., at 504\xe2\x80\x93505.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 28, 2003, the Court of Appeals issued an order amending its first opinion and denying rehearing en banc.  <em>Newdow</em> v. <em>U. S. Congress</em>, 328 F.\xc2\xa03d 466, 468 (CA9 2003) <em>(Newdow</em> <em>III)</em>.  The amended opinion omitted the initial opinion\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing to challenge the 1954 Act and declined to determine whether Newdow was entitled to declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of that Act.  <em>Id</em>., at 490.  Nine judges dissented from the denial of en banc review.  <em>Id</em>., at 471, 482.  We granted the School District\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider two questions: (1) whether Newdow has standing as a noncustodial parent to challenge the School District\xe2\x80\x99s policy, and (2) if so, whether the policy offends the First Amendment.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/945/index.html">540 U. S. 945</a> (2003).</p> <p style="text-align: left;">III</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In every federal case, the party bringing the suit must establish standing to prosecute the action.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U. S. 490</a>, 498 (1975).  The standing requirement is born partly of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an idea, which is more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and explicit theory, about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U. S. 737</a>, 750 (1984) (quoting <em>Vander Jagt</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neill</em>, 699 F.\xc2\xa02d 1166, 1178\xe2\x80\x931179 (CADC 1983) (Bork, J., concurring)).</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The command to guard jealously and exercise rarely our power to make constitutional pronouncements requires strictest adherence when matters of great national significance are at stake.  Even in cases concededly within our jurisdiction under Article III, we abide by \xe2\x80\x9ca series of rules under which [we have] avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon [us] for decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).

Although we have not exhaustively defined the prudential dimensions of the standing doctrine, we have explained that prudential standing encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cthe general prohibition on a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s raising another person\xe2\x80\x99s legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em>, 468 U.

S., at 500.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the principal areas in which this Court has customarily declined to intervene is the realm of domestic relations.  Long ago we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Burrus,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/136/586/index.html">136 U.

S. 415</a>, 435 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cFamily relations are a traditional area of state concern\xe2\x80\x9d).  So strong is our deference to state law in this area that we have recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic relations exception\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cdivests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html"></a><a href="/us/504/689/index.html">504 U. S. 689</a>, 703 (1992).  We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving \xe2\x80\x9celements of the domestic relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue:</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xe2\x80\x9cThis would be so when a case presents \xe2\x80\x98difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar.\xe2\x80\x99  Such might well be the case if a federal suit were filed prior to effectuation of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree, and the suit depended on a determination of the status of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 705\xe2\x80\x93706 (quoting <em>Colorado River,</em> 424 U. S., at 814).</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> Thus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Palmore</em> v. <em>Sidoti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/429/index.html">466 U. S. 429</a>, 432\xe2\x80\x93434 (1984), in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.[<a href="#F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 initial decision.  At that time, the child\xe2\x80\x99s custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>sole</em> legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d her daughter.  <em>Newdow II</em>, 313 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98psychological and educational needs,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but it authorized Banning to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exercise legal control\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d if the parents could not reach \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mutual agreement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the child\xe2\x80\x99s custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have \xe2\x80\x9cjoint legal custody,\xe2\x80\x9d but that Banning \xe2\x80\x9cmakes the final decisions if the two \xe2\x80\xa6 disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 127\xe2\x80\x93128.[<a href="#F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Newdow contends that despite Banning\xe2\x80\x99s final authority, he retains \xe2\x80\x9can unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter\xe2\x80\x94free from governmental interference\xe2\x80\x94the atheistic beliefs he finds persuasive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 48, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xa078.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of a widespread national ritual, and the meaning of our Constitution.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.  In marked contrast to our case law on <em>jus tertii</em>, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Singleton</em> v. <em>Wulff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/index.html">428 U. S. 106</a>, 113\xe2\x80\x93118 (1976) (plurality opinion), the interests of this parent and this child are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.[<a href="#F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s parental status is defined by California\xe2\x80\x99s domestic relations law.  Our custom on questions of state law ordinarily is to defer to the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the State is located.  See <em>Bishop</em> v. <em>Wood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/index.html">426 U. S. 341</a>, 346\xe2\x80\x93347 (1976).  In this case, the Court of Appeals, which possesses greater familiarity with California law, concluded that state law vests in Newdow a cognizable right to influence his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s religious upbringing.  <em>Newdow II</em>, 313 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 504\xe2\x80\x93505.  The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the child\xe2\x80\x99s religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Marriage of Murga</em>, 103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 505, 163 Cal. Rptr. 79, 82 (1980).  See also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Marriage of Mentry</em>, 142 Cal. App. 3d 260, 268\xe2\x80\x93270, 190 Cal. Rptr. 843, 849\xe2\x80\x93850 (1983) (relying on <em>Murga</em> to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s consent).  Animated by a conception of \xe2\x80\x9cfamily privacy\xe2\x80\x9d that includes \xe2\x80\x9cnot simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy,\xe2\x80\x9d 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267\xe2\x80\x93268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a zone of private authority within which each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in <em>Mentry</em> and <em>Murga</em>.  He wishes to forestall his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  <em>Mentry</em> and <em>Murga</em> are concerned with protecting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the fragile, complex interpersonal bonds between child and parent,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, and with permitting divorced parents to expose their children to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98diversity of religious experiences [that] is itself a sound stimulant for a child,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s order has deprived Newdow of that status.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s right to communicate with his child\xe2\x80\x94which both California law and the First Amendment recognize\xe2\x80\x94and his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.[<a href="#F8">Footnote 8</a>] </p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">It is so ordered.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> <a href="#T1">Footnote 1</a><p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<font>\xc2\xa0J.

But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.

In contrast, here is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new prudential standing principle: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claimed standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at<em> </em>13.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332, the abstention doctrine, and criticisms of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 construction of California state law, coupled with the prudential standing prohibition on a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s raising another person\xe2\x80\x99s legal rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992), in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971).  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a \xe2\x80\x9cdivorce, alimony, and child custody decree,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because \xe2\x80\x9cthe status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 706.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from <em>Ankenbrandt</em>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the abstention doctrine: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving \xe2\x80\x98elements of the domestic relationship,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>id., </em>at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The Court perfunctorily states: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, <em>e.g., Palmore</em> v. <em>Sidoti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/429/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/429/index.html">466 U. S. 429</a>, 432\xe2\x80\x93434 (1984), in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from <em>Ankenbrandt</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than <em>Palmore</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332, which \xe2\x80\x9cdivests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ankenbrandt,</em> 504<em> </em>U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School District\xe2\x80\x99s conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we discussed abstention in <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, we first noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a \xe2\x80\x98virtually unflagging obligation \xe2\x80\xa6 to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 705 (quoting <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/index.html">424 U. S. 800</a>, 817 (1976)).  <em>Ankenbrandt\xe2\x80\x99</em>s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial federal question \xe2\x80\xa6 transcends or exists apart from the family law issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at<em> </em>9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court cites<em> Palmore</em> v. <em>Sidoti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/429/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/429/index.html">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984), as an example of the exceptional case where a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue\xe2\x80\x9d makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  <em>Ante, </em>at 9.  In <em>Palmore</em>, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mother\xe2\x80\x99s interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial federal question,\xe2\x80\x9d did not \xe2\x80\x9ctranscen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[w]e granted certiorari to review a <em>judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic dispute\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Palmore </em>no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent \xe2\x80\x9chas standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>United States Congress</em>, 292 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondent\xe2\x80\x99s standing to determine whether the parents\xe2\x80\x99 court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondent\xe2\x80\x99s standing.  <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>United States Congress</em>, 313 F.\xc2\xa03d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, \xe2\x80\x9cnoncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 504.  The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custody order, because he retained sufficient parental rights under California law.  <em>Id., </em>at 504\xe2\x80\x93505 (citing <em>In re Marriage of</em> <em>Murga</em> v.<em> Peterson</em>, 103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 163 Cal. Rptr. 79 (1980); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Marriage of Mentry</em>, 142 Cal. App. 3d 260, 190 Cal. Rptr. 843 (1983)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent \xe2\x80\x9crequests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in <em>Mentry </em>and <em>Murga</em>\xe2\x80\x9d because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.  <em>Ante, </em>at 13.  The Court then mischaracterizes respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alleged interest based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>de novo</em> construction of California law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The correct characterization of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante, </em>at 11, we have a \xe2\x80\x9csettled and firm policy of deferring to regional courts of appeals in matters that involve the construction of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Massachusetts,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/879/index.html">487 U. S. 879</a>, 908 (1988).  We do so \xe2\x80\x9cnot only to render unnecessary review of their decisions in this respect, but also to reflect our belief that district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brockett</em> v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/index.html">472 U. S. 491</a>, 500 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In contrast to the Court, I would defer to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of California law because it is our settled policy to do so, and because I think that the Court of Appeals has the better reading of <em>Murga, supra, </em>and <em>Mentry</em>, <em>supra.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Banning\xe2\x80\x99s view of the merits of this case to diminish respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interest, stating that the respondent \xe2\x80\x9cwishes to forestall his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at<em> </em>13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the State\xe2\x80\x99s placing its <em>imprimatur</em> on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 construction of California law, Banning\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cveto power\xe2\x80\x9d does not override respondent\xe2\x80\x99s right to challenge the pledge ceremony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes that the California cases \xe2\x80\x9cdo not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Banning\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent asserts that the School District\xe2\x80\x99s pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s rights thereunder), the daughter <em>is not the source </em>of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interest is properly described.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 Article III standing decision and the prudential prohibition on third-party standing provide no basis for denying respondent\nstanding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court may have succeeded in confining this novel principle almost narrowly enough to be, like the proverbial excursion ticket\xe2\x80\x94good for this day only\xe2\x80\x94our doctrine of prudential standing should be governed by general principles, rather than ad\xc2\xa0hoc improvisations.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pledge of Allegiance reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 U.

Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub.

Act of June 14, 1954, ch.\xc2\xa0297, \xc2\xa77, 68 Stat. 249.  The amendment\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this country\xe2\x80\x99s belief in God with the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107\xe2\x80\x93293, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x932, 116 Stat. 2057\xe2\x80\x932060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under God\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religion\xe2\x80\x99s role in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history abound.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s first inauguration on April 30, 1789, he </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cstepped toward the iron rail, where he was to receive the oath of office.  The diminutive secretary of the Senate, Samuel Otis, squeezed between the President and Chancellor Livingston and raised up the crimson cushion with a Bible on it.

Whence shall my help come.\xe2\x80\x99  The Chancellor proceeded with the oath: \xe2\x80\x98Do you solemnly swear that you will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of your ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States?\xe2\x80\x99 The President responded, \xe2\x80\x98I solemnly swear,\xe2\x80\x99 and repeated the oath, adding, \xe2\x80\x98So help me God.\xe2\x80\x99  He then bent forward and kissed the Bible before him.\xe2\x80\x9d  M.

S. 624</a>, 642 (1943) (holding that the government may not compel school students to recite the Pledge).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the voluntary nature of the School District policy, the Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, held that the policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly coerces a religious act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newdow</em> v. <em>United States Congress,</em> 328 F.\xc2\xa03d 466, 487 (CA9 2003).  To reach this result, the court relied primarily on our decision in <em>Lee </em>v.<em> Weisman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992).  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as \xe2\x80\x9can explicit religious exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 598, and \xe2\x80\x9ca formal religious exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 589.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court notes in its opinion, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgement of the ideals that our flag symbolizes.  Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not believe that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge converts its recital into a \xe2\x80\x9creligious exercise\xe2\x80\x9d of the sort described in <em>Lee</em>.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d but with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwith liberty and justice for all.\xe2\x80\x9d  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the First Amendment can respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim succeed, where one based on objections to \xe2\x80\x9cwith liberty and justice for all\xe2\x80\x9d fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular government\xe2\x80\x94the national, the state, and the local\xe2\x80\x94collaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of \xe2\x80\x9checkler\xe2\x80\x99s veto\xe2\x80\x9d over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I note that respondent contends that he has never been a \xe2\x80\x9cnoncustodial\xe2\x80\x9d parent and points out that under the state court\xe2\x80\x99s most recent order he enjoys joint legal custody.

The answer to that question is: \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  But in a testament to the condition of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence, the Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion based on a persuasive reading of our precedent, especially <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992).  In my view, <em>Lee</em> adopted an expansive definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d that cannot be defended however one decides the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult question\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether and how th[e Establishment] Clause should constrain state action under the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U. S. 639</a>, 678 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring).  The difficulties with our Establishment Clause cases, however, run far deeper than <em>Lee</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I agree with The Chief Justice that respondent Newdow has standing, I would take this opportunity to begin the process of rethinking the Establishment Clause.  I would acknowledge that the Establishment Clause is a federalism provision, which, for this reason, resists incorporation.  Moreover, as I will explain, the Pledge policy is not implicated by any sensible incorporation of the Establishment Clause, which would probably cover little more than the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Lee</em>, the Court held that invocations and benedictions could not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, be given at public secondary school graduations.  The Court emphasized \xe2\x80\x9cheightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 592.  It brushed aside both the fact that the students were not required to attend the graduation, see <em>id.,</em> at 586 (asserting that student \xe2\x80\x9cattendance and participation in\xe2\x80\x9d the graduation ceremony \xe2\x80\x9care in a fair and real sense obligatory\xe2\x80\x9d), and the fact that they were not compelled, in any meaningful sense, to participate in the religious component of the graduation ceremony, see <em>id.,</em> at 593 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters is that, given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court surmised that the prayer violated the Establishment Clause because a high school student could\xe2\x80\x94in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cpeer pressure\xe2\x80\x9d to attend graduation and \xe2\x80\x9cto stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94have \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will not allow,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adherence to Lee</em> would require us to strike down the Pledge policy, which, in most respects, poses more serious difficulties than the prayer at issue in <em>Lee</em>.  A prayer at graduation is a one-time event, the graduating students are almost (if not already) adults, and their parents are usually present.  By contrast, very young students, removed from the protection of their parents, are exposed to the Pledge each and every day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, this case is more troubling than <em>Lee</em> with respect to both kinds of \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, although students may feel \xe2\x80\x9cpeer pressure\xe2\x80\x9d to attend their graduations, the pressure here is far less subtle: Students are actually compelled (that is, by law, and not merely \xe2\x80\x9cin a fair and real sense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 586) to attend school.  See also <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a>, 223 (1963).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Analysis of the second form of \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d identified in <em>Lee</em> is somewhat more complicated.  It is true that since this Court decided <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a> (1943), States cannot compel (in the traditional sense) students to pledge their allegiance.  Formally, then, dissenters can refuse to pledge, and this refusal would be clear to onlookers.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That is, students have a theoretical means of opting out of the exercise.  But as <em>Lee</em> indicated: \xe2\x80\x9cResearch in psychology supports the common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 593\xe2\x80\x93594 (citations omitted).  On <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, <em>Barnette</em>\xe2\x80\x99s protection is illusory, for government officials can allow children to recite the Pledge and let peer pressure take its natural and predictable course.  Further, even if we assume that sitting in respectful silence could be <em>mistaken</em> for assent to or participation in a graduation prayer, dissenting students graduating from high school are not \xe2\x80\x9ccoerced\xe2\x80\x9d to pray.  At most, they are \xe2\x80\x9ccoerced\xe2\x80\x9d into possibly appearing to assent to the prayer.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d here, however, results in unwilling children actually pledging their allegiance.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice would distinguish <em>Lee</em> by asserting \xe2\x80\x9cthat the phrase \xe2\x80\x98under God\xe2\x80\x99 in the Pledge [does not] conver[t] its recital into a \xe2\x80\x98religious exercise\xe2\x80\x99 of the sort described in <em>Lee</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (opinion concurring in judgment).  In <em>Barnette</em>, the Court addressed a state law that compelled students to salute and pledge allegiance to the flag.  The Court described this as \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsion of students to declare a belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 U. S., at 631.  The Pledge \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 633.  In its current form, reciting the Pledge entails pledging allegiance to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74.  Under <em>Barnette</em>, pledging allegiance is \xe2\x80\x9cto declare a belief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that now includes that this is \xe2\x80\x9cone Nation under God.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to see how this does not entail an affirmation that God exists.  Whether or not we classify affirming the existence of God as a \xe2\x80\x9cformal religious exercise\xe2\x80\x9d akin to prayer, it must present the same or similar constitutional problems.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, such an affirmation is not a prayer, and I admit that this might be a significant distinction.  But the Court has squarely held that the government cannot require a person to \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare his belief in God.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Torcaso</em> v. <em>Watkins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/488/index.html">367 U. S. 488</a>, 489 (1961); <em>id.,</em> at 495 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person \xe2\x80\x98to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U. S. 872</a>, 877 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe government may not compel affirmation of religious belief\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Widmar</em> v. <em>Vincent,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/index.html">454 U. S. 263</a>, 269\xe2\x80\x93270, n.\xc2\xa06 (1981) (rejecting attempt to distinguish worship from other forms of religious speech).  And the Court has said, in my view questionably, that the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 594 (1989).  See also <em>Good News Club</em> v. <em>Milford Central School,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/98/index.html">533 U. S. 98</a>, 126\xe2\x80\x93127 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I conclude that, as a matter of our precedent, the Pledge policy is unconstitutional.  I believe, however, that <em>Lee</em> was wrongly decided.  <em>Lee</em> depended on a notion of \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d that, as I discuss below, has no basis in law or reason.  The kind of coercion implicated by the Religion Clauses is that accomplished \xe2\x80\x9c<em>by force of law and threat of penalty</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 640 (Scalia, J., dissenting); see <em>id.,</em> at 640\xe2\x80\x93645.  Peer pressure, unpleasant as it may be, is not coercion.  But rejection of <em>Lee</em>-style \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d does not suffice to settle this case.  Although children are not coerced to pledge their allegiance, they are legally coerced to attend school.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Schempp</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Engel</em> v. <em>Vitale,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/index.html">370 U. S. 421</a> (1962).  Because what is at issue is a state action, the question becomes whether the Pledge policy implicates a religious liberty right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\nII</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I accept that the Free Exercise Clause, which clearly protects an individual right, applies against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <em>Zelman</em>, 536 U. S., at 679, and n.\xc2\xa04 (Thomas, J., concurring).  But the Establishment Clause is another matter.  The text and history of the Establishment Clause strongly suggest that it is a federalism provision intended to prevent Congress from interfering with state establishments.  Thus, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, which does protect an individual right, it makes little sense to incorporate the Establishment Clause.  In any case, I do not believe that the Pledge policy infringes any religious liberty right that would arise from incorporation of the Clause.  Because the Pledge policy also does not infringe any free-exercise rights, I conclude that it is constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\nA</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Establishment Clause provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amdt. 1.  As a textual matter, this Clause probably prohibits Congress from establishing a national religion.  But see P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 106, n.\xc2\xa040 (2002) (citing sources).  Perhaps more importantly, the Clause made clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments, notwithstanding any argument that could be made based on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  See A. Amar, The Bill of Rights 36\xe2\x80\x9339 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the text of the Clause suggests that it reaches any further.  The Establishment Clause does not purport to protect individual rights.  By contrast, the Free Exercise Clause plainly protects individuals against congressional interference with the right to exercise their religion, and the remaining Clauses within the First Amendment expressly disable Congress from \xe2\x80\x9cabridging [particular] <em>freedom[s]</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  This textual analysis is consistent with the prevailing view that the Constitution left religion to the States.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa71873 (5th ed. 1891); see also Amar, The Bill of Rights, at 32\xe2\x80\x9342; <em>id.,</em> at 246\xe2\x80\x93257.  History also supports this understanding: At the founding, at least six States had established religions, see McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1409, 1437 (1990).  Nor has this federalism point escaped the notice of Members of this Court.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Zelman</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 677\xe2\x80\x93680 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>Lee</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite simply, the Establishment Clause is best understood as a federalism provision\xe2\x80\x94it protects state establishments from federal interference but does not protect any individual right.  These two features independently make incorporation of the Clause difficult to understand.  The best argument in favor of incorporation would be that, by disabling Congress from establishing a national religion, the Clause protected an individual right, enforceable against the Federal Government, to be free from coercive federal establishments.  Incorporation of this individual right, the argument goes, makes sense.  I have alluded to this possibility before. See <em>Zelman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 679 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cStates may pass laws that include or touch on religious matters so long as these laws do not impede free exercise rights <em>or any other individual liberty interest</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even assuming that the Establishment Clause precludes the Federal Government from establishing a national religion, it does not follow that the Clause created or protects any individual right.  For the reasons discussed above, it is more likely that States and only States were the direct beneficiaries.  See also <em>Lee</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Moreover, incorporation of this putative individual right leads to a peculiar outcome: It would prohibit precisely what the Establishment Clause was intended to protect\xe2\x80\x94<em>state</em> establishments of religion.  See <em>Schempp,</em> 374 U. S., at 310 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fourteenth Amendment has somehow absorbed the Establishment Clause, although it is not without irony that a constitutional provision evidently designed to leave the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nevertheless, the potential right against federal establishments is the only candidate for incorporation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would welcome the opportunity to consider more fully the difficult questions whether and how the Establishment Clause applies against the States.  One observation suffices for now: As strange as it sounds, an incorporated Establishment Clause prohibits exactly what the Establishment Clause protected\xe2\x80\x94state practices that pertain to \xe2\x80\x9can establishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the very least, the burden of persuasion rests with anyone who claims that the term took on a different meaning upon incorporation.  We must therefore determine whether the Pledge policy pertains to an \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The traditional \xe2\x80\x9cestablishments of religion\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Establishment Clause is addressed necessarily involve actual legal coercion:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support <em>by force of law and threat of penalty</em>.  Typically, attendance at the state church was required; only clergy of the official church could lawfully perform sacraments; and dissenters, if tolerated, faced an array of civil disabilities.  L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 4 (1986).  Thus, for example, in the Colony of Virginia, where the Church of England had been established, ministers were required by law to conform to the doctrine and rites of the Church of England; and all persons were required to attend church and observe the Sabbath, were tithed for the public support of Anglican ministers, and were taxed for the costs of building and repairing churches.  <em>Id.,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lee</em>, 505 U. S., at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">Even if \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d had a broader definition, one that included support for religion generally through taxation, the element of legal coercion (by the State) would still be present.  See <em>id.,</em> at 641.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also conceivable that a government could \xe2\x80\x9cestablish\xe2\x80\x9d a religion by imbuing it with governmental authority, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Larkin</em> v. <em>Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s Den, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/116/index.html">459 U.

S. 687</a>, 698 (1994); <em>County of Allegheny, </em>492 U. S., at 590\xe2\x80\x93591.  A religious organization that carries some measure of the authority of the State begins to look like a traditional \xe2\x80\x9creligious establishment,\xe2\x80\x9d at least when that authority can be used coercively.  See also <em>Zorach</em> v. <em>Clauson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/343/306/index.html">343 U.

In addressing the constitutionality of voluntary school prayer, Justice Stewart made essentially this point, emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cwe deal here not with the establishment of a state church, \xe2\x80\xa6 but with whether school children who want to begin their day by joining in prayer must be prohibited from doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engel</em>, 370 U.

Legal compulsion is an inherent component of \xe2\x80\x9cpreferences\xe2\x80\x9d in this context.  James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (reprinted in <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html">330 U.

Like him, I would follow our policy of deferring to the Federal Courts of Appeals in matters that involve the interpretation of state law, see <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Massachusetts,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/879/index.html">487 U. S. 879</a> (1988), and thereby conclude that the respondent does have standing to bring his constitutional claim before a federal court.  Like The Chief Justice, I believe that we must examine those questions, and, like him, I believe that petitioner school district\xe2\x80\x99s policy of having its teachers lead students in voluntary recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance does not offend the Establishment Clause.  But while the history presented by The Chief Justice illuminates the constitutional problems this case presents, I write separately to explain the principles that guide my own analysis of the constitutionality of that policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have said before, the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9ccannot easily be reduced to a single test.  There are different categories of Establishment Clause cases, which may call for different approaches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist.</em> v. <em>Grumet,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/687/index.html">512 U. S. 687</a>, 720 (1994) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  When a court confronts a challenge to government-sponsored speech or displays, I continue to believe that the endorsement test \xe2\x80\x9ccaptures the essential command of the Establishment Clause, namely, that government must not make a person\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs relevant to his or her standing in the political community by conveying a message \xe2\x80\x98that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 627 (1989) (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (quoting <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a>, 70 (1985) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment)).  In that context, I repeatedly have applied the endorsement test, <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.</em> v. <em>Pinette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/753/index.html">515 U. S. 753</a>, 772\xe2\x80\x93773 (1995) (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (display of a cross in a plaza next to state capitol); <em>Allegheny</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 625 (display of cr\xc3\xa8che in county courthouse and menorah outside city and county buildings); <em>Wallace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 69 (statute authorizing a meditative moment of silence in classrooms); <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 688 (1984) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (inclusion of Nativity scene in city government\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas display), and I would do so again here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Endorsement, I have explained, \xe2\x80\x9csends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>In order to decide whether endorsement has occurred, a reviewing court must keep in mind two crucial and related principles.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, because the endorsement test seeks \xe2\x80\x9cto identify those situations in which government makes adherence to a religion relevant \xe2\x80\xa6 to a person\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the political community,\xe2\x80\x9d it assumes the viewpoint of a reasonable observer.  <em>Pinette</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 772 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the dizzying religious heterogeneity of our Nation, adopting a subjective approach would reduce the test to an absurdity.  Nearly any government action could be overturned as a violation of the Establishment Clause if a \xe2\x80\x9checkler\xe2\x80\x99s veto\xe2\x80\x9d sufficed to show that its message was one of endorsement.  See <em>Pinette</em>, 515 U. S. at 780 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always<em> someone</em> who, with a particular quantum of knowledge, reasonably might perceive a particular action as an endorsement of religion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, because the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable observer\xe2\x80\x9d must embody a community ideal of social judgment, as well as rational judgment, the test does not evaluate a practice in isolation from its origins and context.  Instead, the reasonable observer must be deemed aware of the history of the conduct in question, and must understand its place in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s cultural landscape.  See <em>id.,</em> at 781.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has permitted government, in some instances, to refer to or commemorate religion in public life.  See<em>, e.g.</em>, <em>Pinette</em>, <em>supra</em>;<em> Allegheny</em>, <em>supra</em>; <em>Lynch</em>, <em>supra</em>; <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a> (1983)<em>.  </em>While the Court\xe2\x80\x99s explicit rationales have varied, my own has been consistent; I believe that although these references speak in the language of religious belief, they are more properly understood as employing the idiom for essentially secular purposes.  One such purpose is to commemorate the role of religion in our history.  In my view, some references to religion in public life and government are the inevitable consequence of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s origins.  Just as the Court has refused to ignore changes in the religious composition of our Nation in explaining the modern scope of the Religion Clauses, see<em>, e.g.</em>,<em> Wallace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9354 (even if the Religion Clauses were originally meant only to forestall intolerance between Christian sects, they now encompass all forms of religious conscience), it should not deny that our history has left its mark on our national traditions.  It is unsurprising that a Nation founded by religious refugees and dedicated to religious freedom should find references to divinity in its symbols, songs, mottoes, and oaths.*<footcall num="*">  Eradicating such references would sever ties to a history that sustains this Nation even today.  See<em> Allegheny</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 623 (declining to draw lines that would \xe2\x80\x9csweep away all government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of religion in the lives of our citizens\xe2\x80\x9d).</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Facially religious references can serve other valuable purposes in public life as well.  Twenty years ago, I wrote that such references \xe2\x80\x9cserve, in the only ways reasonably possible in our culture, the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions, expressing confidence in the future, and encouraging the recognition of what is worthy of appreciation in society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lynch</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 692\xe2\x80\x93693 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  For centuries, we have marked important occasions or pronouncements with references to God and invocations of divine assistance.  Such references can serve to solemnize an occasion instead of to invoke divine provenance.  The reasonable observer discussed above, fully aware of our national history and the origins of such practices, would not perceive these acknowledgments as signifying a government endorsement of any specific religion, or even of religion over non-religion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are no <em>de minimis</em> violations of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94\nno constitutional harms so slight that the courts are obliged to ignore them.  Given the values that the Establishment Clause was meant to serve, however, I believe that government can, in a discrete category of cases, acknowledge or refer to the divine without offending the Constitution.  This category of \xe2\x80\x9cceremonial deism\xe2\x80\x9d most clearly encompasses such things as the national motto (\xe2\x80\x9cIn God We Trust\xe2\x80\x9d), religious references in traditional patriotic songs such as the Star-Spangled Banner, and the words with which the Marshal of this Court opens each of its sessions (\xe2\x80\x9cGod save the United States and this honorable Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <em>Allegheny, </em>492 U. S., at 630 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  These references are not minor trespasses upon the Establishment Clause to which I turn a blind eye.  Instead, their history, character, and context prevent them from being constitutional violations at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case requires us to determine whether the appearance of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge of Allegiance constitutes an instance of such ceremonial deism.  Although it is a close question, I conclude that it does, based on my evaluation of the following four factors.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>History and Ubiquity</em></font></p><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</font></em><font b="1">The constitutional value of ceremonial deism turns on a shared understanding of its legitimate nonreligious purposes.  That sort of understanding can exist only when a given practice has been in place for a significant portion of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, and when it is observed by enough persons that it can fairly be called ubiquitous.  See <em>Lynch</em>, 465 U. S., at 693.  By contrast, novel or uncommon references to religion can more easily be perceived as government endorsements because the reasonable observer cannot be presumed to be fully familiar with their origins.  As a result, in examining whether a given practice constitutes an instance of ceremonial deism, its \xe2\x80\x9chistory and ubiquity\xe2\x80\x9d will be of great importance.  As I explained in <em>Allegheny,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 630\xe2\x80\x93631:</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the endorsement test, the \xe2\x80\x98history and ubiquity\xe2\x80\x99 of a practice is relevant not because it creates an \xe2\x80\x98artificial exception\xe2\x80\x99 from that test.  On the contrary, the \xe2\x80\x98history and ubiquity\xe2\x80\x99 of a practice is relevant because it provides part of the context in which a reasonable observer evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice conveys a message of endorsement of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifty years have passed since the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d were added, a span of time that is not inconsiderable given the relative youth of our Nation.  In that time, the Pledge has become, alongside the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner, our most routine ceremonial act of patriotism; countless schoolchildren recite it daily, and their religious heterogeneity reflects that of the Nation as a whole.  As a result, the Pledge and the context in which it is employed are familiar and nearly inseparable in the public mind.  No reasonable observer could have been surprised to learn the words of the Pledge, or that petitioner school district has a policy of leading its students in daily recitation of the Pledge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It cannot be doubted that \xe2\x80\x9cno one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use, even when that span of time covers our entire national existence and indeed predates it.  Yet an unbroken practice . . .\xc2\xa0is not something to be lightly cast aside.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U. S. 664</a>, 678 (1970).  And the history of a given practice is all the more relevant when the practice has been employed pervasively without engendering significant controversy.  In <em>Lynch</em>, where we evaluated the constitutionality of a town Christmas display that included a cr\xc3\xa8che, we found relevant to the endorsement question the fact that the display had \xe2\x80\x9capparently caused no political divisiveness prior to the filing of this lawsuit\xe2\x80\x9d despite its use for over 40 years.  See 465 U. S., at 692\xe2\x80\x93693.  Similarly, in the 50 years that the Pledge has been recited as it is now, by millions of children, this was, at the time of its filing, only the third reported case of which I am aware to challenge it as an impermissible establishment of religion.  See <em>Sherman</em> v. <em>Community Consol. School Dist. 21</em>, 980 F.\xc2\xa02d 437 (CA7 1992); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Denny</em>, 280 F. Supp. 651 (ED Cal. 1968).  The citizens of this Nation have been neither timid nor unimaginative in challenging government practices as forbidden \xe2\x80\x9cestablishments\xe2\x80\x9d of religion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Altman</em> v. <em>Bedford Central School Dist.</em>, 245 F. 3d 49 (CA2 2001) (challenging, among other things, reading of a story of the Hindu deity Ganesha in a fourth-grade classroom); <em>Alvarado </em>v. <em>San Jose</em>, 94 F.\xc2\xa03d 1223 (CA9 1996) (challenge to use of a sculpture of the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl to commemorate Mexican contributions to city culture); <em>Peloza</em> v. <em>Capistrano Unified School Dist.</em>, 37 F. 3d 517 (CA9 1994) (high school biology teacher\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to requirement that he teach the concept of evolution); <em>Fleischfresser </em>v. <em>Directors of School Dist. 200</em>, 15 F.\xc2\xa03d 680 (CA7 1994) (challenge to school supplemental reading program that included works of fantasy involving witches, goblins, and Halloween); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Allen</em>, 760 F.\xc2\xa02d 447, 449 (CA2 1985) (challenge to conviction for vandalism of B\xe2\x80\x9352 bomber, based on theory that property-protection statute established a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98national religion of nuclearism \xe2\x80\xa6 in which the bomb is the new source of salvation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Grove</em> v. <em>Mead School Dist.

Given the vigor and creativity of such challenges, I find it telling that so little ire has been directed at the Pledge.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Absence of worship or prayer</em></font></p><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</font></em><font b="1">\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to worship in his own way [lies] in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engel</em> v. <em>Vitale,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/index.html">370 U. S. 421</a>, 429 (1962).  Because of this principle, only in the most extraordinary circumstances could actual worship or prayer be defended as ceremonial deism.  We have upheld only one such prayer against Establishment Clause challenge, and it was supported by an extremely long and unambiguous history.  See <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a> (1983) (upholding Nebraska Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s 200-year-old practice of opening its sessions with a prayer offered by a chaplain).  Any statement that has as its purpose placing the speaker or listener in a penitent state of mind, or that is intended to create a spiritual communion or invoke divine aid, strays from the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing an event and recognizing a shared religious history.  <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/290/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/290/index.html">530 U.

But, as I have explained, the relevant viewpoint is that of a reasonable observer, fully cognizant of the history, ubiquity, and context of the practice in question.  Such an observer\ncould not conclude that reciting the Pledge, including the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes an instance of worship.  I know of no religion that incorporates the Pledge into its canon, nor one that would count the Pledge as a meaningful expression of religious faith.  Even if taken literally, the phrase is merely descriptive; it purports only to identify the United States as a Nation subject to divine authority.  That cannot be seen as a serious invocation of God or as an expression of individual submission to divine authority.  <em>Cf. Engel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 424 (describing prayer as \xe2\x80\x9ca solemn avowal of faith and supplication for the blessing of the Almighty\xe2\x80\x9d).  A reasonable observer would note that petitioner school district\xe2\x80\x99s policy of Pledge recitation appears under the heading of \xe2\x80\x9cPatriotic Observances,\xe2\x80\x9d and the California law which it implements refers to \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate patriotic exercises.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Educ. Code \xc2\xa752720.  Petitioner school district also employs teachers, not chaplains or religious instructors, to lead its students\xe2\x80\x99 exercise; this serves as a further indication that it does not treat the Pledge as a prayer.  <em>Cf. Lee </em>v. <em>Weisman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a>, 594 (1992) (reasoning that a graduation benediction could not be construed as a <em>de minimis </em>religious exercise without offending the rabbi who offered it).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that some of the legislators who voted to add the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d to the Pledge may have done so in an attempt to attach to it an overtly religious message.  See<em> </em>H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., pp.\xc2\xa02-3.  But their intentions cannot, on their own, decide our inquiry.  First of all, those legislators also had permissible secular objectives in mind\xe2\x80\x94they meant, for example, to acknowledge the religious origins of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the \xe2\x80\x9cindividuality and the dignity of the human being.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1.  Second\xe2\x80\x94and more critically\xe2\x80\x94the <em>subsequent </em>social and cultural history of the Pledge shows that its original secular character was not transformed by its amendment.  In <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a> (1963), we explained that a government may initiate a practice \xe2\x80\x9cfor the impermissible purpose of supporting religion\xe2\x80\x9d but nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9cretai[n] the la[w] for<font b="1"> the permissible purpose of furthering overwhelmingly secular ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 263\xe2\x80\x93264 (citing <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/index.html">366 U. S. 420</a> (1961)).  Whatever the sectarian ends its authors may have had in mind, our continued repetition of the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cone Nation under God\xe2\x80\x9d in an exclusively patriotic context has shaped the cultural significance of that phrase to conform to that context.  Any religious freight the words may have been meant to carry originally has long since been lost.  See<em> Lynch</em>, 465 U. S., at 716 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the reference to God in the Pledge might be permissible because it has \xe2\x80\x9clost through rote repetition any significant religious content\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Absence of reference to particular religion</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</font></em><font b="1">\xe2\x80\x9cThe clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Larson</em> v. <em>Valente,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/228/index.html">456 U. S. 228</a>, 244 (1982).  While general acknowledgments of religion need not be viewed by reasonable observers as denigrating the nonreligious, the same cannot be said of instances \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the endorsement is sectarian, in the sense of specifying details upon which men and women who believe in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are known to differ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weisman</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting).   As a result, no religious acknowledgment could claim to be an instance of ceremonial deism if it explicitly favored one particular religious belief system over another.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pledge complies with this requirement.  It does not refer to a nation \xe2\x80\x9cunder Jesus\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunder Vishnu,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead acknowledges religion in a general way: a simple reference to a generic \xe2\x80\x9cGod.\xe2\x80\x9d  Of course, some religions\xe2\x80\x94\nBuddhism, for instance\xe2\x80\x94are not based upon a belief in a separate Supreme Being.  See Brief for Buddhist Temples, Centers, and Organizations as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But one would be hard pressed to imagine a brief solemnizing reference to religion that would adequately encompass every religious belief expressed by any citizen of this Nation.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder God,\xe2\x80\x9d conceived and added at a time when our national religious diversity was neither as robust nor as well recognized as it is now, represents a tolerable attempt to acknowledge religion and to invoke its solemnizing power without favoring any individual religious sect or belief system.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Minimal religious content</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A final factor that makes the Pledge an instance of ceremonial deism, in my view, is its highly circumscribed reference to God.  In most of the cases in which we have struck down government speech or displays under the Establishment Clause, the offending religious content has been much more pervasive.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Weisman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 581\xe2\x80\x93582 (prayers involving repeated thanks to God and requests for blessings).  Of course, a ceremony cannot avoid Establishment Clause scrutiny simply by avoiding an explicit mention of God.  See <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a> (1985) (invalidating Alabama statute providing moment of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer).  But the brevity of a reference to religion or to God in a ceremonial exercise can be important for several reasons.  First, it tends to confirm that the reference is being used to acknowledge religion or to solemnize an event rather than to endorse religion in any way.  Second, it makes it easier for those participants who wish to \xe2\x80\x9copt out\xe2\x80\x9d of language they find offensive to do so without having to reject the ceremony entirely.  And third, it tends to limit the ability of government to express a preference for one religious sect over another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reference to \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d in the Pledge of Allegiance qualifies as a minimal reference to religion; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s challenge focuses on only two of the Pledge\xe2\x80\x99s 31 words.  Moreover, the presence of those words is not absolutely essential to the Pledge, as demonstrated by the fact that it existed without them for over 50 years.  As a result, students who wish to avoid saying the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d still can consider themselves meaningful participants in the exercise if they join in reciting the remainder of the Pledge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have framed my inquiry as a specific application of the endorsement test by examining whether the ceremony or representation would convey a message to a reasonable observer, familiar with its history, origins, and context, that those who do not adhere to its literal message are political outsiders.  But consideration of these factors would lead me to the same result even if I were to apply the \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d test that has featured in several opinions of this Court.  <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/290/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/290/index.html">530 U. S. 290</a> (2000); <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The coercion test provides that, \xe2\x80\x9cat a minimum \xe2\x80\xa6 government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which \xe2\x80\x98establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 586 (quoting <em>Lynch</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 678).  Any coercion that persuades an onlooker to participate in an act of ceremonial deism is inconsequential, as an Establishment Clause matter, because such acts are simply not religious in character.  As a result, symbolic references to religion that qualify as instances of ceremonial deism will pass the coercion test as well as the endorsement test.  This is not to say, however, that government could <em>overtly</em> coerce a person to participate in an act of ceremonial deism.  Our cardinal freedom is one of belief; leaders in this Nation cannot force us to proclaim our allegiance to <em>any </em>creed, whether it be religious, philosophic, or political.  That principle found eloquent expression in a case involving the Pledge itself, even before it contained the words to which respondent now objects.  See<em> West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a>, 642 (1943) (Jackson, J.).  The compulsion of which Justice Jackson was concerned, however, was of the direct sort\xe2\x80\x94the Constitution does not guarantee citizens a right entirely to avoid ideas with which they disagree.  It would betray its own principles if it did; no robust democracy insulates its citizens from views that they might find novel or even inflammatory.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michael Newdow\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to petitioner school district\xe2\x80\x99s policy is a well-intentioned one, but his distaste for the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cone Nation under God,\xe2\x80\x9d however sincere, cannot be the yardstick of our Establishment Clause inquiry.  Certain ceremonial references to God and religion in our Nation are the inevitable consequence of the religious history that gave birth to our founding principles of liberty.
