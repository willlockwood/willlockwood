The excuse suggested by the claimant of the vessel was stress of weather.  He stated in his claim and answer that the vessel laden with 1,272 barrels of flour, sailed from New York on 26 February, 1808, cleared and bound for St. Mary\'s with a <em>bona fide</em> intention of going there and without any intent of going to any foreign place.  But that by contrary winds and stress of weather and the leaky condition of the vessel, he was compelled against his will (he being owner and supercargo) and against the will of the captain and crew, to go to, and enter the port of Gustavia, in the Island of St. Bartholomews, in the West Indies, where he was obliged by the leaky and shattered condition of the vessel to unlade the cargo, which was greatly damaged, and he could not afterwards obtain permission to carry it away again, but was compelled to sell it there. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 11 U.

Nor are the state of the winds, or the latitude </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 11 U.

In short, had the original destination been to the West Indies and this known to the crew, it would be difficult to fix perjury upon anyone of those who have given evidence in this cause.</p>\n<p>In such a case, where no presumption can or ought to be made in favor of the owner of the vessel, and with so strong a temptation as he had to violate the law -- her condemnation is inevitable.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
