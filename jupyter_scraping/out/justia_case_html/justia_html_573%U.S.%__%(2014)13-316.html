The District Court declined to give Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s proposed jury instruction that a conviction under \xc2\xa71344(2) required proof of \xe2\x80\x9cintent to defraud a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury convicted Loughrin, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Section 1344(2) does not require the Government to prove that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution.

Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s construction would also make \xc2\xa71344(2) a mere subset of \xc2\xa71344(1), which prohibits any scheme \xe2\x80\x9cto defraud a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  That view is untenable because those clauses are separated by the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d signaling that each is intended to have separate meaning.

The mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single, unbroken sentence, whereas \xc2\xa71344\xe2\x80\x99s two clauses have separate numbering, line breaks, and equivalent indentation\xe2\x80\x94all indications of separate meaning.  Moreover, Congress likely did not intend to adopt McNally\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation when it enacted \xc2\xa71344, because at that time (three years before McNally) every Court of Appeals had interpreted the word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in the mail fraud statute in its usual, disjunctive sense.  And while McNally found that unique features of the mail fraud statute\xe2\x80\x99s history supported its view, the legislative history surrounding the adoption of \xc2\xa71344 points the other way.

This, he says, would unduly expand the reach of federal criminal law into an area traditionally left to the States.  But this argument ignores a significant textual limit on \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s reach: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to acquire) the bank property \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d the misrepresentation.  That language limits \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s application to cases (like this one) in which the misrepresentation has some real connection to a federally insured bank, and thus to the pertinent federal interest.

We hold that the Government need not make that showing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner Kevin Loughrin executed a scheme to convert altered or forged checks into cash.  Pretending to be a Mormon missionary going door-to-door in a neighborhood in Salt Lake City, he rifled through residential mailboxes and stole any checks he found.  Sometimes, he washed, bleached, ironed, and dried the checks to remove the existing writing, and then filled them out as he wanted; other times, he did nothing more than cross out the name of the original payee and add another.  And when he was lucky enough to stumble upon a blank check, he completed it and forged the accountholder\xe2\x80\x99s signature.  Over several months, Loughrin made out six of these checks to the retailer Target, for amounts of up to $250.  His modus operandi was to go to a local store and, posing as the accountholder, present an altered check to a cashier to purchase merchandise.  After the cashier accepted the check (which, remarkably enough, happened time after time), Loughrin would leave the store, then turn around and walk back inside to return the goods for cash.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Each of the six checks that Loughrin presented to Target was drawn on an account at a federally insured bank, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo.  Employees in Target\xe2\x80\x99s back office identified three of the checks as fraudulent, and so declined to submit them for payment.  Target deposited the other three checks.  The bank refused payment on one, after the accountholder notified the bank that she had seen a man steal her mail.  Target appears to have received payment for the other two checks, though the record does not conclusively establish that fact.  See Brief for United States 6, 7, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Federal Government eventually caught up with Loughrin and charged him with six counts of committing bank fraud\xe2\x80\x94one for each of the altered checks presented to Target.  The federal bank fraud statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344, provides as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises;</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ruling (for a reason not material here) that Circuit precedent precluded convicting Loughrin under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s first clause, \xc2\xa71344(1), the District Court allowed the case to go to the jury on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s second, \xc2\xa71344(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The court instructed the jury that it could convict Loughrin under that clause if, in offering the fraudulent checks to Target, he had \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly executed or at-tempted to execute a scheme or artifice to obtain money or property from the [banks on which the checks were drawn] by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 7.  Loughrin asked as well for another instruction: The jury, he argued, must also find that he acted with \xe2\x80\x9cintent to defraud a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.  The court, however, declined to give that charge, and the jury convicted Loughrin on all six counts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  See 710 F.\xc2\xa03d 1111 (2013).  As relevant here, it rejected Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9ca conviction under \xc2\xa71344(2) requires proof that he intended to defraud the banks on which the [altered] checks had been drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1115.  That intent, the court reasoned, is necessary only under the bank fraud law\xe2\x80\x99s first clause.  The court acknowledged that under its interpretation, \xc2\xa71344(2) \xe2\x80\x9ccast[s] a wide net for bank fraud liability,\xe2\x80\x9d but concluded that such a result is \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by the plain language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1117.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), to resolve a Circuit split on whether \xc2\xa71344(2) requires the Government to show that a defendant intended to defraud a federally insured bank or other financial institution.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  We now affirm the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We begin with common ground.  All parties agree, as do we and the Courts of Appeals, that \xc2\xa71344(2) requires that a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly execute[ ], or attempt[ ] to execute, a scheme or artifice\xe2\x80\x9d with at least two elements.  First, the clause requires that the defendant intend \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain any of the moneys . . . or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  (We refer to that element, more briefly, as intent \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain bank property.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Brief for United States 11, 17, 20, 22, 32; Brief for Petitioner 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  And second, the clause requires that the envisioned result\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the obtaining of bank property\xe2\x80\x94occur \xe2\x80\x9cby means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States 21\xe2\x80\x9322; Reply Brief 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Loughrin does not contest the jury instructions on either of those two elements.  Nor does he properly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting them here.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The single question presented is whether the Government must prove yet another element: that the defendant intended to defraud a bank.  As Loughrin describes it, that element would compel the Government to show not just that a defendant intended to obtain bank property (as the jury here found), but also that he specifically intended to deceive a bank.  See Reply Brief 17.  And that difference, Loughrin claims, would have mattered in this case, because his intent to deceive ran only to Target, and not to any of the banks on which his altered checks were drawn.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the text of \xc2\xa71344(2) precludes Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  That clause focuses, first, on the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s goal (obtaining bank property) and, second, on the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s means (a false representation).  We will later address how the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d component of \xc2\xa71344(2) imposes certain inherent limits on its reach.  See infra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  But nothing in the clause additionally demands that a defendant have a specific intent to deceive a bank.  And indeed, imposing that requirement would prevent \xc2\xa71344(2) from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear terms.  In particular, the clause covers property \xe2\x80\x9cowned by\xe2\x80\x9d the bank but in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s custody and control (say, a home that the bank entrusted to a real estate company after foreclosure); thus, a person violates \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s plain text by deceiving a non-bank custodian into giving up bank property that it holds.  Yet under Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s view, the clause would not apply to such a case except in the (presumably rare) circumstance in which the fraudster\xe2\x80\x99s intent to deceive extended beyond the custodian to the bank itself.  His proposed inquiry would thus function as an extra-textual limit on the clause\xe2\x80\x99s compass.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n         And Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa71344(2) becomes yet more untenable in light of the rest of the bank fraud statute.  That is because the first clause of \xc2\xa71344, as all agree, includes the requirement that a defendant intend to \xe2\x80\x9cdefraud a financial institution\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, that is \xc2\xa71344(1)\xe2\x80\x99s whole sum and substance.  See Brief for United States 18; Brief for Petitioner 8.  To read the next clause, following the word \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d as somehow repeating that requirement, even while using different words, is to disregard what \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d customarily means.  As we have recognized, that term\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Woods, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14).  Yet Loughrin would have us construe the two entirely distinct statutory phrases that the word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d joins as containing an identical element.  And in doing so, his interpretation would make \xc2\xa71344\xe2\x80\x99s second clause a mere subset of its first: If, that is, \xc2\xa71344(2) implicitly required intent to defraud a bank, it would apply only to conduct already falling within \xc2\xa71344(1).  Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s construction thus effectively reads \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cincluding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a definition foreign to any dictionary we know of.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As that account suggests, Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s view collides as well with more general canons of statutory interpretation.  We have often noted that when \xe2\x80\x9cCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94let alone in the very next provision\xe2\x80\x94this Court \xe2\x80\x9cpresume[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended a difference in meaning.  Russello v. United States,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16,\n23 (1983)\n (citation omitted).  And here, as just stated, overriding that presumption would render \xc2\xa71344\xe2\x80\x99s second clause superfluous.  Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s view thus runs afoul of the \xe2\x80\x9ccardinal principle\xe2\x80\x9d of interpretation that courts \xe2\x80\x9cmust give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Williams v. Taylor,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 362,\n404 (2000)\n (citation omitted).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Loughrin makes two principal arguments to avoid the import of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text.  First, he relies on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of comparable language in the federal mail fraud statute to assert that Congress intended \xc2\xa71344(2) merely to explicate the scope of \xc2\xa71344(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on scheming to defraud a bank, rather than to cover any additional conduct.  And second, he contends that unless we read the second clause in that duplicative way, its coverage would extend to a vast range of fraudulent schemes, thus intruding on the historic criminal jurisdiction of the States.  Neither argument is without force, but in the end, neither carries the day.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9c[D]espite appearances,\xe2\x80\x9d Loughrin avers, \xc2\xa71344(2) has no independent meaning: It merely specifies part of what \xc2\xa71344(1) already encompasses.  Brief for Petitioner 8.  To support that concededly counterintuitive argument, Loughrin invokes our decision in McNally v. United States,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350 (1987)\n, interpreting similar language in the mail fraud statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  That law, which served as a model for \xc2\xa71344, see Neder v. United States,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9321 (1999), prohibits using the mail to further \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  Loughrin rightly explains that, despite the word \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d McNally understood that provision as setting forth just one offense\xe2\x80\x94using the mails to advance a scheme to defraud.  The provision\xe2\x80\x99s back half, we held, merely codified a prior judicial decision applying the front half: In other words, the back clarified that the front included certain conduct, rather than doing independent work.  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358\xe2\x80\x93359.  According to Loughrin, we should read the bank fraud statute in the same way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the two statutes, as an initial matter, have notable textual differences.  The mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single, unbroken sentence.  By contrast, \xc2\xa71344\xe2\x80\x99s two clauses have separate numbers, line breaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation\xe2\x80\x94thus placing the clauses visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.  The legislative structure thus reinforces the usual (even if not McNally\xe2\x80\x99s) understanding of the word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than, as Loughrin would have it, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on McNally encounters a serious chronological problem.  Congress passed the bank fraud statute in 1984, three years before we decided that case.  And at that time, every Court of Appeals to have addressed the issue had concluded that the two relevant phrases of the mail fraud law must be read \xe2\x80\x9cin the disjunctive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconstrued independently.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358 (citing, e.g., United States v. Clapps, 732 F.\xc2\xa02d 1148, 1152 (CA3 1984); United States v. States, 488 F.\xc2\xa02d 761, 764 (CA8 1973)).  McNally disagreed, eschewing the most natural reading of the text in favor of evidence it found in the drafting history of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s money-or-property clause.  But the Congress that passed the bank fraud statute could hardly have predicted that McNally would overturn the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 uniform reading.  We thus see no reason to doubt that in enacting \xc2\xa71344, Congress said what it meant and meant what it said, see Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249,\n254 (1992)\n\xe2\x80\x94i.e., that it both said \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d and meant \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in the usual sense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        And a peek at history, of the kind McNally found decisive, only cuts against Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the bank fraud statute.  According to McNally, Congress added the mail fraud statute\xe2\x80\x99s second, money-or-property clause merely to affirm a decision of ours interpreting the ban on schemes \xe2\x80\x9cto defraud\xe2\x80\x9d: The second clause, McNally reasoned, thus worked no substantive change in the law.  See 483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 356\xe2\x80\x93359 (discussing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s codification of Durland v. United States,\n\n161 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306 (1896)\n).  By contrast, Congress passed the bank fraud statute to disapprove prior judicial rulings and thereby expand federal criminal law\xe2\x80\x99s scope\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, partly to cover cases like Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s.  One of the decisions prompting enactment of the bank fraud law, United States v. Maze,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 395 (1974)\n, involved a defendant who used a stolen credit card to obtain food and lodging.  (Substitute a check for a credit card and Maze becomes Loughrin.)  The Government brought charges of mail fraud, relying on post-purchase mailings between the merchants and issuing bank to satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s mailing element.  But the Court held those mailings insufficiently integral to the fraudulent scheme to support the conviction.  See id., at 402.  Hence, Maze created a \xe2\x80\x9cserious gap[ ] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in Federal jurisdiction over frauds against banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p. 377 (1983).  Congress passed \xc2\xa71344 to fill that gap, enabling the Federal Government to prosecute fraudsters like Maze and Loughrin.  We will not deprive that enactment of its full effect because McNally relied on different history to adopt a counter-textual reading of a similar provision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Loughrin also appeals to principles of federalism to support his proffered construction.  Unless we read \xc2\xa71344(2) as requiring intent to defraud a bank, Loughrin contends, the provision will extend to every fraud, no matter how prosaic, happening to involve payment with a check\xe2\x80\x94even when that check is perfectly valid.  Consider, for example, a garden-variety con: A fraudster sells something to a customer, misrepresenting its value.  There are countless variations, but let\xe2\x80\x99s say the fraudster passes off a cheap knock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag.  The victim pays for the bag with a good check, which the criminal cashes.  Voila!, Loughrin says, bank fraud has just happened\xe2\x80\x94unless we adopt his narrowing construction.  After all, the criminal has intended to \xe2\x80\x9cobtain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under the custody or control of\xe2\x80\x9d the bank (the money in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s checking account), and has made \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. representations\xe2\x80\x9d (the lies to the victim about the handbag).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  But if the bank fraud statute were to encompass all such schemes, Loughrin continues, it would interfere with matters \xe2\x80\x9csquarely within the traditional criminal jurisdiction of the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 29.  We should avoid such a \xe2\x80\x9csweeping expansion of federal criminal\xe2\x80\x9d law, he concludes, by reading \xc2\xa71344(2), just like \xc2\xa71344(1), as requiring intent to defraud a bank.  Reply Brief 3 (quoting Cleveland v. United States,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12,\n24 (2000)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We agree with this much of what Loughrin argues: Unless the text requires us to do so, we should not construe \xc2\xa71344(2) as a plenary ban on fraud, contingent only on use of a check (rather than cash).  As we have often (and recently) repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not be quick to assume that Congress has meant to effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bond v. United States, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13) (quoting United States v. Bass,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336,\n349 (1971)\n); see Cleveland, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe resist the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because it invites us to approve a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction in the absence of a clear statement by Congress\xe2\x80\x9d); Jones v. United States,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n858 (2000)\n (similar).  Just such a rebalancing of criminal jurisdiction would follow from interpreting \xc2\xa71344(2) to cover every pedestrian swindle happening to involve payment by check, but in no other way affecting financial institutions.  Indeed, even the Government expresses some mild discomfort with \xe2\x80\x9cfederalizing frauds that are only tangentially related to the banking system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 41.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But in claiming that we must therefore recognize an invisible element, Loughrin fails to take account of a significant textual limitation on \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Under that clause, it is not enough that a fraudster scheme to obtain money from a bank and that he make a false statement.  The provision as well includes a relational component: The criminal must acquire (or attempt to acquire) bank property \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d the misrepresentation.  That phrase typically indicates that the given result (the \xe2\x80\x9cend\xe2\x80\x9d) is achieved, at least in part, through the specified action, instrument, or method (the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d), such that the connection between the two is something more than oblique, indirect, and incidental.  See, e.g., Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1399 (2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the instrumentality of: by the use of as a means\xe2\x80\x9d); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 516 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n instrument, agency, method, or course of action, by the employment of which some object is or may be attained, or which is concerned in bringing about some result\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, not every but-for cause will do.  If, to pick an example out of a hat, Jane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say she \xe2\x80\x9ccrossed the Rockies by means of a car,\xe2\x80\x9d even though her sale of the car somehow figured in the trip she took.  The relation between those things would be (as the Government puts it) too \xe2\x80\x9ctangential[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d to make use of the phrase at all appropriate.  Brief for United States 41.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d language is satisfied when, as here, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false statement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of bank property) to part with money in its control.  That occurs, most clearly, when a defendant makes a misrepresentation to the bank itself\xe2\x80\x94say, when he attempts to cash, at the teller\xe2\x80\x99s window, a forged or altered check.  In that event, the defendant seeks to obtain bank property by means of presenting the forgery directly to a bank em-ployee.  But no less is the counterfeit check the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of obtaining bank funds when a defendant like Loughrin offers it as payment to a third party like Target.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  After all, a merchant accepts a check only to pass it along to a bank for payment; and upon receipt from the merchant, that check triggers the disbursement of bank funds just as if presented by the fraudster himself.  So in either case, the forged or altered check\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the false statement\xe2\x80\x94serves in the ordinary course as the means (or to use other words, the mechanism or instrumentality) of obtaining bank property.  To be sure, a merchant might detect the fraud (as Target sometimes did) and decline to submit the forged or altered check to the bank.  But that is to say only that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s scheme to obtain bank property by means of a false statement may not succeed.  And we have long made clear that such failure is irrelevant in a bank fraud case, because \xc2\xa71344 punishes not \xe2\x80\x9ccompleted frauds,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead fraudulent \xe2\x80\x9cscheme[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Neder, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        By contrast, the cases Loughrin hopes will unnerve us\xe2\x80\x94exemplified by the handbag swindle\xe2\x80\x94do not satisfy \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Recall that in such a case the check is perfectly valid; so the check itself is not (as it was here) a false or fraudulent means of obtaining bank money.  And the false pretense that has led, say, the handbag buyer to give a check to the fraudster has nothing to do with the bank that will cash it: No one would dream of passing on to the bank (as Target would forward a forged check) the lie that a knock-off is a Louis Vuitton.  The bank\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the scheme is, indeed, wholly fortuitous\xe2\x80\x94a function of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s paying the fraudster by (valid) check rather than cash.  Of course, the bank would not have disbursed funds had the misrepresentation never occurred, and in that sense, the lie counts as a but-for cause of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s payment.  But as we have said, \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d language requires more, see supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312: It demands that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false statement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian) to part with its money.  And in cases like the handbag swindle, where no false statement will ever go to a financial institution, the fraud is not the means of obtaining bank property.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The premise of Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s federalism argument thus collapses.  He claims that we must import an unstated element into \xc2\xa71344(2) to avoid covering run-of-the-mill frauds, properly of concern only to States.  But in fact, the text of \xc2\xa71344(2) already limits its scope to deceptions that have some real connection to a federally insured bank, and thus implicate the pertinent federal interest.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, at 378 (noting that federal \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction is based on the fact that the victim of the offense is a federally controlled or insured institution\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s own crime, as we have explained, is one such scheme, because he made false statements, in the form of forged and altered checks, that a merchant would, in the ordinary course of business, forward to a bank for payment.  See supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  We therefore reject Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71344(2) and his challenge to his conviction.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in\n, includes a federally insured bank of the kind involved here.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare 710 F.\xc2\xa03d 1111, 1116 (CA10 2013) (case below) (\xc2\xa71344(2) does not require intent to defraud a bank); v, 270 F.\xc2\xa03d 986, 991 (CA6 2001) (same), with  v. , 315 F.\xc2\xa03d 190, 197 (CA3 2002) (\xc2\xa71344(2) requires such intent);  v. , 221 F. 3d 19, 29 (CA1 2000) (same); v. , 117 F.\xc2\xa03d 82, 92\xe2\x80\x9393 (CA2 1997) (same).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Loughrin argued to the jury that the evidence failed to show that he intended to obtain bank property: He claimed that once he \xe2\x80\x9cobtained cash from Target, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. he was indifferent to whether Target ever submitted the check to a bank or whether a bank ever made payment on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 32; see Tr. 233\xe2\x80\x93235; App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.

The Courts of Appeals, for example, have unanimously agreed that the Government can prosecute check kiting (,writing checks against an account with insufficient funds in a way designed to keep them from bouncing) only under Clause (1), because such schemes do not involve any false representations.

But that objection is based on a misunderstanding of our opinion.  The \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d phrase calls for an inquiry into the directness of the relationship between means and ends, not the fraudster\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent.

And we concur with the bottom line of sexample: There, the means (the two dollars) is the thing that achieves the specified end (getting the cup of 7-Eleven coffee).

See Brief for Petitioner 36\xe2\x80\x9340.  But once again, nothing like that element appears in the clause\'s text.

See ante, at 4 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he clause requires that the defendant intend \xe2\x80\x98to obtain any of the moneys . . . or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (ellipsis in original)); ante, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the defendant has the requisite intent to acquire bank property, his presentation of a forged or altered check to a third party satisfies \xc2\xa71344(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98means\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  That is incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress expressly denoted the mens rea a defendant must have to violate \xc2\xa71344(2), and it is not purpose.  Instead, \xc2\xa71344(2) imposes liability on \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain bank property.  (Emphasis added.)  It is hard to imagine how Congress could have been clearer as to the mental state required for liability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary statements apparently derive from the fact that the criminal venture that a defendant must knowingly execute or attempt to execute must be a scheme or artifice \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. property owned by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a financial institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71344(2).  A defendant must have the purpose to obtain bank property, so the argument goes, because he must execute a scheme the purpose of which is to obtain bank property.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This argument confuses the design of the scheme with the mens rea of the defendant.  The statute requires only that the objective of the scheme must be the obtaining of bank property, not that the defendant must have such an objective.  Of course, in many cases a scheme\xe2\x80\x99s objective will be the same as an individual defendant\xe2\x80\x99s.  Where the defendant acts alone, for instance, his objective will almost certainly be the same as that of the scheme, and the inquiry into the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mens rea and the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s objective will accordingly merge.  But in some cases, such as those involving large, complex criminal ventures, a given defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose may diverge from the scheme\xe2\x80\x99s objective.  For instance, a defendant who is paid by a large ring of check forgers to present one of their forged checks to a bank for payment has executed \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme or artifice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to obtain\xe2\x80\x9d bank property, even if he only presents the check because he is paid to do so and personally does not care whether the forged check is honored.  That is because the objective of the scheme as a whole is to obtain bank property, and the defendant knowingly executes that scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority reads the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.  That term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Dixon v. United States,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n5 (2006)\n.  If the majority is correct that the language \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme or artifice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to obtain\xe2\x80\x9d bank property demands that the defendant intend to obtain bank prop-erty, then the word \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d is superfluous, because a defendant whose purpose is to obtain bank property will always know that his purpose is to obtain bank property.  Why would Congress expressly specify a lesser mens rea element if elsewhere in the statute it commands a greater, subsuming one?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Proof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also acted purposely, and therefore the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dicta may not have much practical effect.  But if the issue is presented in a future case, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements must be regarded as dicta.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that a defendant must intend to obtain bank property to be convicted under \xc2\xa71344(2) are unnecessary to its conclusion that a defendant may be convicted under this provision without proof that he either intended to defraud a bank or created a risk of loss to a bank.  Furthermore, as the Court makes clear, petitioner waived any challenge to his conviction arising from an asserted statutory requirement that he must have intended to obtain bank property.

But I am dubitante on the point that one obtains bank property \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d a fraudulent statement only if that statement is \xe2\x80\x9cthe mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of bank property) to part with money in its control,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 12.  The Government suggested that test, but only briefly claimed it was to be found in the \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d language, Brief for United States 40\xe2\x80\x9341\xe2\x80\x94so briefly that Loughrin responded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Government does not claim any textual basis for this [naturally inducing] rule,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 13.  We have heard scant argument (nothing but the Government\xe2\x80\x99s bare-bones assertion) in favor of the \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d textual limitation, and no adversary presentation whatever opposing it.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion raises the subject in order to reply to Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, unless we adopt his proposed nontextual limitations, all frauds effected by receipt of a check will become federal crimes.  It seems to me enough to say that Loughrin\xe2\x80\x99s solutions to the problem of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s sweep are, for the reasons well explained by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, not correct.  What the proper solution may be should in my view be left for another day.  I discuss below my difficulties with the \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d solution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Recall the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical garden-variety con.  \xe2\x80\x9cA fraudster [makes a statement] pass[ing] off a cheap knock-off as a Louis Vuitton handbag.  The victim pays for the bag with a good check, which the criminal cashes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  The fraudster unquestionably has obtained bank property.  But how?  By presenting the check to a bank teller, yes.  But also by duping the buyer.  Yet according to the Court, the fraudster\xe2\x80\x99s deceit was not a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of obtaining the cash, because tricking a buyer into swapping a check for a counterfeit carryall is not a \xe2\x80\x9cmechanism naturally inducing a bank . . . to part with money in its control.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  The bank\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, it says, is mere happenstance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I do not know where the Court\xe2\x80\x99s crabbed definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d comes from.  Certainly not the dictionary entries that it quotes.  Quite the contrary, those suggest that the handbag fraudster\xe2\x80\x99s deceitful statement was a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d: Undoubtedly, the trickery was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98method, or course of action, by the employment of which [bank property was] attained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  Though the dictionaries do not appear to add that the connection between \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d and end must be \xe2\x80\x9csomething more than oblique, indirect, and incidental,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., I agree that, in common usage, not every but-for cause of an act is a cause \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d which the act has occurred.  No one would say, for example, that the handbag fraudster obtained bank property by means of his ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 emigration to the United States.  But all would say, I think, that he obtained the property by means of the lie.  His deceit is far from merely incidental to, or an oblique or indirect way of, obtaining the money.  That was the lie\xe2\x80\x99s very purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That the fraudster likely was indifferent to the victim\xe2\x80\x99s method of payment\xe2\x80\x94making his receipt of bank money instead of straight cash merely \xe2\x80\x9cfortuitous,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x94does not suggest, in ordinary parlance, that the fraud was not a means of acquiring bank property.  Indeed, saying that indifference is disqualifying comes close to requiring the intent to defraud a bank that the Court properly rejects.  In any case, indifference certainly does not cause what is a means not to be a means.  Suppose I resolve to purchase (with the two dollars in my billfold) a coffee at the first convenience store I pass on my way to work.  I am indifferent to what store that might be.  I catch sight of a 7-Eleven, pull in, and, with my cash, buy the drink.  That it is a 7-Eleven coffee rather than a Sheetz coffee is \xe2\x80\x9cwholly fortuitous,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  Still, no one would say that I had not obtained 7-Eleven coffee by means of my two dollars.  So too with the handbag swindler: Regardless of whether the cash is the victim\xe2\x80\x99s or, technically, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s, and regardless of whether the swindler cared which it was, would we not say that the fraudster has obtained it by means of the trick?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority responds that the measure of \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d is not indifference or the absence of fortuity but rather directness.  And not just proximate-cause-like directness\xe2\x80\x94the fraudulent statement literally must \xe2\x80\x9creach the bank,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, n.\xc2\xa08.  Once again, it seems to me the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition does not accord with common usage.  Suppose little Bobby falsely tells his mother that he got an A on his weekly spelling test and so deserves an extra cookie after dinner.  Mother will not be home for dinner, but she leaves a note for Father: \xe2\x80\x9cBobby gets an extra cookie after dinner tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Much like the handbag buyer\xe2\x80\x99s note to the bank: \xe2\x80\x9cPay $2,000 to the order of Mr. Handbag Fraudster.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Dinner wraps up, and Bobby gets his second cookie.  Has he obtained it by means of the fib to his mother?  Plainly yes, an ordinary English speaker would say.  But plainly no under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition, since the lie did not make its way to the father.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s chief illustration of its \xe2\x80\x9cby means of\xe2\x80\x9d gloss seems to me contrived.  If \xe2\x80\x9cJane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip cross-country, no one would say she \xe2\x80\x98crossed the Rockies by means of a car.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  Of course.  By using two vehicles of conveyance, and describing the end in question as \xe2\x80\x9ccrossing the Rockies,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement that the car was the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of achieving that end invites one to think that Jill traveled by automobile.  But the proper question\xe2\x80\x94the one parallel to the question whether the fraudster obtained bank funds by means of fraudulently selling the counterfeit\xe2\x80\x94is not whether Jill crossed the Rockies by means of the car, but whether she funded her trip by means of selling the car.  Which she assuredly did.  Just as the handbag swindler, in the Louis Vuitton example, obtained money by means of his false representation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I certainly agree that this statute must be interpreted, if possible, in a manner that will not make every fraud effected by receipt of a check a federal offense.  But deciding this case does not require us to identify that manner, and I would leave that for another case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
