Whether John Penn the younger, as surviving obligee and mortgagee, is entitled to have and receive from Anthony Butler, all the said bonds and mortgages, for the purpose of collecting and distributing the money thereby secured and made payable, according to the respective interests of the parties?</ul> <ul>\'2d. Or, whether the executors of John Penn the elder, are entitled to receive one fourth part in value of the said specific bonds and mortgages, for their separate use and benefit?</ul> <ul>\'3d. Or, whether the Court will consider the bonds and mortgages, under the circumstances of the case, as several, as well as joint, to be followed with the consequences inferable from such principle?\'</ul> <p> On the hearing, Mr. Butler\'s testimony stated, \'that he was, at first, the separate agent of John Penn, the younger, when Mr. T. Francis was the separate agent of John Penn, the elder; that during this period the bonds, for purchase money of lands sold, were separately taken, according to the interests of the parties; that in September 1787, he became the agent of both the Penns, but continued, for sometime, to take separate bonds; that the purchasors complained of the expense of giving separate bonds and mortgages, and he then determined to take them for the joint use of his principals; that he received no instructions upon the subject, from either party; and that he was not, in fact, aware of any difference between taking the bonds jointly or severally.\' It, also, appeared, that Mr. J. R. Coates had been appointed the agent of John Penn, the younger; and the general question was, whether Mr. Butler should be directed to deliver up the joint bonds and mortgages to him, as the agent of the surviving obligee? </p><p> Ingersoll and Mifflin contended, against the claim of the surviving obligee, 1st. That it was founded merely on the mistake, and misapprehension, of the agent, acting for two parties, having distinct interests, and giving separate powers. 2d. That, under such circumstances, a Court of equity can, and ought to, apportion the securities, by a fair division of them; so that each party may possess the entire interest and remedy in his proportion. 3d. That even if an apportionment could not be made, the Court will appoint a receiver, to collect and divide the joint fund, in the regular proportions. On these points, the following books were cited: 3 P. Wms. 158. 21 Vin. Abr. 509. pl. 4. Carth. 16. 1 Eq. Abr. 293. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 4 U.S. 354, 357</a></p><p> 3 Vez. jun. 628. 631. 399. 2 Com. Dig. 255. 258. 1 Eq. Abr. 290. A. </p><p> Rawle and Dallas, in support of the claim of the surviving obligee, urged, 1st. That the point of law is clearly in favour of of the claim; and to set aside a plain rule of law, there must be strong, controuling, principles of equity, in favour of the opposite party. 2d. That the act of taking joint securities was not a mistake, or error; but a deliberate act for the accommodation of purchasors. 3d. That there was no suggestion of a fraud, a breach of trust, wilful laches, or probable insolvency, in reference to the surviving obligee. 4th. That there is, therefore, no foundation for the interposition of the Court to appoint a receiver; nor to justify a Court of equity in compelling the parties to accede to an arbitrary apportionment of the securities. On these points were cited, Yelv. 177. Vent. 34. 3 Dy. 350. Sheph. 363. 356. 2 Brownl. 207. 1 Eq. Abr. 290. 2 Pow. 263. Ambl. 311. 1 Dall. Rep. 248. Wallace v. Fitzsimons. 2 Com. Dig. 110. 209. 213. 255. 2 Vern. 556. </p><p></p><p> THE COURT. </p><p> The COURT were decidedl of opinion, that, at law, the surviving obligee was entitled to the possession of the joint securities, that he might recover the amount; and that there was no ground laid, on the present occasion, for the interposition of a Court of equity. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> On this clear intimation of the opinion of the Court, Mr. Coates liberally declared, that if the executors of John Penn, the elder, would concur in giving him immediate possession of the securities, he would not charge a commission, for collecting and paying their proportion of the amount; and the proposition was, accordingly, agreed to </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
