It found that petitioner had abused the writ, that petitioner\'s claims were procedurally barred, and, in any event, that these claims were meritless. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner\'s application for a certificate of probable cause and a stay of execution, finding his claims to lack merit. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/772/668/">772 F.2d 668</a> (1985). </p><p> Three times in the past six months, a stay of execution has been granted in virtually identical circumstances.

In light of the disposition of those applications, I can see no justification whatever for the Court\'s action today.
