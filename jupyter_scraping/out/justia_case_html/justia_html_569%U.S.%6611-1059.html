After she ignored petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, the District Court, finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that the Rule 68 offer fully satisfied her claim, concluded that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Third Circuit reversed.  It held that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim was moot but that her collective action was not, explaining that allowing defendants to \xe2\x80\x9cpick off\xe2\x80\x9d named plaintiffs before certification with calculated Rule 68 offers would frustrate the goals of collective actions.  The case was remanded to the District Court to allow respondent to seek \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification,\xe2\x80\x9d which, if successful, would relate back to the date of her complaint.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Because respondent had no personal interest in representing putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness, her suit was appropriately dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Thus, this Court assumes, without deciding, that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offer mooted her individual claim.

After respondent\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim became moot, the suit became moot because she had no personal interest in representing others in the action.  To avoid that outcome, respondent relies on cases that arose in the context of Rule 23 class actions, but they are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are fundamentally different from FLSA collective actions and because the cases are inapplicable to the facts here.

Geraghty extended the principles of Sosna\xe2\x80\x94which held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified\xe2\x80\x94to denials of class certification motions; and it provided that, where an action would have acquired independent legal status but for the district court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling on appeal \xe2\x80\x9crelates back\xe2\x80\x9d to the time of the erroneous denial.  445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404, and n.\xc2\xa011.  However, Geraghty\xe2\x80\x99s holding was explicitly limited to cases in which the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim remains live at the time the district court denies class certification.  See id., at 407, n.\xc2\xa011.  Here, respondent had not yet moved for \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification\xe2\x80\x9d when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipatorily ruled on any such request.  She thus has no certification decision to which her claim could have related back.  More fundamentally, essential to Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified under Rule 23.  By contrast, under the FLSA, \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification\xe2\x80\x9d does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or join additional parties to the action.

McLaughlin, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 44\n, is similarly inapplicable.  Respondent argues that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s use of Rule 68 offers to \xe2\x80\x9cpick off\xe2\x80\x9d a named plaintiff before the collective-action process is complete renders the action \xe2\x80\x9cinherently transitory.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation to run its course, and it has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim, not on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s litigation strategy.  Unlike a claim for injunctive relief, a damages claim cannot evade review, nor can an offer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review.  Putative plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit, but they remain free to do so in their own suits.

Bank v. Roper, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326\n, does not support respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the purposes served by the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s collective-action provisions would be frustrated by defendants\xe2\x80\x99 use of Rule 68 to \xe2\x80\x9cpick off\xe2\x80\x9d named plaintiffs before the collective-action process has run its course.  In Roper, where the named plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 individual claims became moot after the District Court denied their Rule 23 class certification motion and entered judgment in their favor based on defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offer of judgment, this Court found that the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because they possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substantive controversy, namely, to shift a portion of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and expenses to successful class litigants.  Here, respondent conceded that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offer provided complete relief, and she asserted no continuing economic interest in shifting attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  Moreover, Roper was tethered to the unique significance of Rule 23 class certification decisions.

The Third Circuit clearly held in this case that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim was moot.  656 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 201.  Acceptance of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument to the contrary now would alter the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, which is impermissible in the absence of a cross-petition from respondent.  See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, \n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 355, \n364 (1994)\n; Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, \n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111\n, n.\xc2\xa014 (1985).

Respondent made a similar concession in her brief to the Court of Appeals, see App. 193, and failed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari. We, therefore, assume, without deciding, that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 68 offer mooted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim.  See Baldwin v.

In the absence of any claimant\xe2\x80\x99s opting in, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit became moot when her individual claim became moot, because she lacked any personal interest in representing others in this action.  While the FLSA authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of himself and \xe2\x80\x9cother employees similarly situated,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(b), the mere presence of collective-action allegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from mootness once the individual claim is satisfied.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn order to avoid this outcome, respondent relies almost entirely upon cases that arose in the context of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 class actions, particularly United States Parole Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Geraghty, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388 (1980)\n; Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326 (1980)\n; and Sosna v. Iowa, \n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393 (1975)\n.  But these cases are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are fundamentally different from collective actions under the FLSA, see Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 177\xe2\x80\x93178 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and because these cases are, by their own terms, inapplicable to these facts.  It follows that this action was appropriately dismissed as moot.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent contends that she has a sufficient personal stake in this case based on a statutorily created collective- action interest in representing other similarly situated employees under \xc2\xa7216(b).  Brief for Respondent 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  In support of her argument, respondent cites our decision in Geraghty, which in turn has its roots in Sosna.  Neither case supports her position.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Sosna, the Court held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified.  419 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 399.  The Court reasoned that when a district court certifies a class, \xe2\x80\x9cthe class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquire[s] a legal status separate from the interest asserted by [the named plaintiff],\xe2\x80\x9d with the result that a live controversy may continue to exist, even after the claim of the named plaintiff becomes moot.  Id., at 399\xe2\x80\x93402.  Geraghty narrowly extended this principle to denials of class certification motions.  The Court held that where an action would have acquired the independent legal status described in Sosna but for the district court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling on appeal \xe2\x80\x9crelates back\xe2\x80\x9d to the time of the erroneous denial of the certification motion.  445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404, and n.\xc2\xa011.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGeraghty is inapposite, because the Court explicitly limited its holding to cases in which the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim remains live at the time the district court denies class certification.  See id., at 407, n.\xc2\xa011.  Here, respondent had not yet moved for \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification\xe2\x80\x9d when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipa-torily ruled on any such request.  Her claim instead became moot prior to these events, foreclosing any recourse to Geraghty.  There is simply no certification decision to which respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim could have related back.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore fundamentally, essential to our decisions in Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified under Rule 23.  Under the FLSA, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification\xe2\x80\x9d does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or join additional parties to the action.  The sole consequence of conditional certification is the sending of court-approved written notice to employees, see Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., supra, at 171\xe2\x80\x93172, who in turn become parties to a collective action only by filing written con- sent with the court, \xc2\xa7216(b).  So even if respondent were to secure a conditional certification ruling on remand, nothing in that ruling would preserve her suit from mootness.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent also advances an argument based on a separate, but related, line of cases in which the Court held that an \xe2\x80\x9cinherently transitory\xe2\x80\x9d class-action claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Like our decision in Geraghty, this line of cases began with Sosna and is similarly inapplicable here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter concluding that the expiration of a named plain-tiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim following certification does not moot the class action, Sosna suggested that, where a named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim becomes moot before the district court has an opportunity to rule on the certification motion, and the issue would otherwise evade review, the certification might \xe2\x80\x9crelate back\xe2\x80\x9d to the filing of the complaint.  419 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 402, n.\xc2\xa011.  The Court has since held that the relation-back doctrine may apply in Rule 23 cases where it is \xe2\x80\x9ccertain that other persons similarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the claims raised are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative\xe2\x80\x99s individual interest expires.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 44, \n52 (1991)\n (quoting Geraghty, supra, at 399), in turn citing Gerstein v. Pugh, \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n, n.\xc2\xa011 (1975)).  Invoking this doctrine, respondent argues that defendants can strategically use Rule 68 offers to \xe2\x80\x9cpick off\xe2\x80\x9d named plaintiffs before the collective-action process is complete, rendering collective actions \xe2\x80\x9cinher-ently transitory\xe2\x80\x9d in effect.  Brief for Respondent 37.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases invoking the \xe2\x80\x9cinherently transitory\xe2\x80\x9d relation-back rationale do not apply.  The \xe2\x80\x9cinherently transitory\xe2\x80\x9d rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable, because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation to run its course.  A plaintiff might seek, for instance, to bring a class action challenging the constitutionality of temporary pretrial detentions.  In doing so, the named plaintiff would face the considerable challenge of preserving his individual claim from mootness, since pretrial custody likely would end prior to the resolution of his claim.  See Gerstein, supra.  To address this problem, the Court explained that in cases where the transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to the suit would effectively insulate defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct from review, certification could potentially \xe2\x80\x9crelate back\xe2\x80\x9d to the filing of the complaint.  Id., at 110, n.\xc2\xa011; McLaughlin, supra, at 52.  But this doctrine has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim, not on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s litigation strategy.  See, e.g., Swisher v. Brady, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204\n, n.\xc2\xa011 (1978); Spencer v. Kemna, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9318 (1998).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint requested statutory damages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging ongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live until it is settled, judicially resolved, or barred by a statute of limitations.  Nor can a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim from review, for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s alleged harm by making the plaintiff whole.  While settlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing unjoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit, such putative plaintiffs remain free to vindicate their rights in their own suits.  They are no less able to have their claims settled or adjudicated following respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit than if her suit had never been filed at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, respondent argues that the purposes served by the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s collective-action provisions\xe2\x80\x94for example, efficient resolution of common claims and lower individual costs associated with litigation\xe2\x80\x94would be frustrated by defendants\xe2\x80\x99 use of Rule 68 to \xe2\x80\x9cpick off\xe2\x80\x9d named plaintiffs before the collective-action process has run its course.  Both respondent and the Court of Appeals purported to find support for this position in our decision in Roper, 445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Roper, the named plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 individual claims became moot after the District Court denied their motion for class certification under Rule 23 and subsequently entered judgment in their favor, based on the defendant bank\xe2\x80\x99s offer of judgment for the maximum recoverable amount of damages, in addition to interest and court costs.  Id., at 329\xe2\x80\x93330.  The Court held that even though the District Court had entered judgment in the named plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 favor, they could nevertheless appeal the denial of their motion to certify the class.  The Court found that, under the particular circumstances of that case, the named plaintiffs possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substantive controversy\xe2\x80\x94namely, to shift a portion of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and expenses to successful class litigants.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Id., at 332\xe2\x80\x93334, and n.\xc2\xa06.

Id., at 336.  As already explained, here, respondent conceded that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offer \xe2\x80\x9cprovided complete relief on her individual claims,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief in Opposition i, and she failed to assert any continuing economic interest in shifting attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs to others.  Moreover, Roper\xe2\x80\x99s dictum was tethered to the unique significance of certification decisions in class-action proceedings.  445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339.  Whatever significance \xe2\x80\x9cconditional certification\xe2\x80\x9d may have in \xc2\xa7216(b) proceedings, it is not tantamount to class certification under Rule 23.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals concluded that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim became moot following petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 68 offer of judgment.

This case raises two circumstances in which the Court has applied this doctrine.  First, where a named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim is \xe2\x80\x9cinherently transi-tory,\xe2\x80\x9d and becomes moot prior to certification, a motion for certification may \xe2\x80\x9crelate back\xe2\x80\x9d to the filing of the complaint.  See, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, \n\xe2\x80\x9352 (1991).  Second, we have held that where a certification motion is denied and a named plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim subsequently becomes moot, an appellate reversal of the certification decision may relate back to the time of the denial.

Some courts maintain that an unaccepted offer of complete relief alone is sufficient to moot the individual\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  E.g., Weiss, supra, at 340; Greisz v. Household Bank (Ill.), N.\xc2\xa0A., 176 F.\xc2\xa03d 1012, 1015 (CA7 1999).

In that event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94founded as it is on an unfounded assumption\xe2\x80\x94would have no real-world meaning or application.  The decision would turn out to be the most one-off of one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks) should happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when something that in fact never happens to an individual FLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so.  That is the case here, for reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ll describe.

Respondent Laura Symczyk brought suit under a provision of the FLSA, \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(b), \xe2\x80\x9con behalf of herself and others similarly situated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 21.  Her complaint alleged  that her former employer, petitioner Genesis Healthcare Corporation (Genesis), violated the FLSA by treating  30 minutes of every shift as an unpaid meal break, even when an employee worked during that time.  Genesis answered the complaint and simultaneously made an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.  That settlement proposal covered only Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim, to the tune of $7,500 in lost wages.  The offer, according to its terms, would \xe2\x80\x9cbe deemed withdrawn\xe2\x80\x9d if Symczyk did not accept it within 10 days.  App. 79.  That deadline came and went without any reply.  The case then proceeded in the normal fashion, with the District Court setting a schedule for discovery.  Pause here for a moment to ask whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anything yet that would moot Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim.  No?

The supposed logic went like this: We (i.e., Genesis) offered Symczyk complete relief on her individual damages claim; she \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively reject[ed] the [o]ffer\xe2\x80\x9d by failing to respond; because she did so, she \xe2\x80\x9cno longer has a personal stake or legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this action\xe2\x80\x9d; accordingly, the court \xe2\x80\x9cshould dismiss her claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 67.  Relying on Circuit precedent, the District Court agreed; it dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94without awarding Symczyk any damages or other relief\xe2\x80\x94based solely on the unaccepted offer Genesis had made.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 35 (citing Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d 337, 340 (CA3 2004)).  And finally, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concurred that Genesis\xe2\x80\x99s offer mooted Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim (though also holding that she could still proceed with a collective action).  See 656 F.\xc2\xa03d 189 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat thrice-asserted view is wrong, wrong, and wrong again.  We made clear earlier this Term that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  By those measures, an unaccepted offer of judgment cannot moot a case.  When a plaintiff rejects such an offer\xe2\x80\x94however good the terms\xe2\x80\x94her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was before.  And so too does the court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to grant her relief.  An unaccepted settlement offer\xe2\x80\x94like any unaccepted contract offer\xe2\x80\x94is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.  As every first-year law student learns, the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s re- jection of an offer \xe2\x80\x9cleaves the matter as if no offer had  ever been made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minneapolis &amp; St.\xc2\xa0Louis R.\xc2\xa0Co. v. Columbus Rolling Mill, \n\n119 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149, \n151 (1886)\n.  Nothing in Rule 68 alters that basic principle; to the contrary, that rule specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(b).  So assuming the case was live before\xe2\x80\x94because the plaintiff had a stake and the court could grant relief\xe2\x80\x94the litigation carries on, unmooted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor this reason, Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim was alive and well when the District Court dismissed her suit.  Recall: Genesis made a settlement offer under Rule 68; Symczyk decided not to accept it; after 10 days, it expired and the suit went forward.  Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual stake in the lawsuit thus remained what it had always been, and ditto the court\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to grant her relief.  After the offer lapsed, just as before, Symczyk possessed an unsatisfied claim, which the court could redress by awarding her damages.  As long as that remained true, Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s claim was not moot, and the District Court could not send her away empty-handed.  So a friendly suggestion to the Third Circuit: Rethink your mootness-by-unaccepted-offer theory.  And a note to all other courts of appeals: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try this at home.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo this point, what I have said conflicts with nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The majority does not attempt to argue, \xc3\xa0 la the Third Circuit, that the unaccepted settlement offer mooted Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual damages claim.  Instead, the majority hangs its hat on a finding of waiver.  See ante, at 5, 11.  The majority notes\xe2\x80\x94correctly\xe2\x80\x94that Symczyk accepted the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule in her briefs below, and also failed to challenge it in her brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari; she contested it first in her merits brief before this Court.  That enables the majority to \xe2\x80\x9cassume, without deciding,\xe2\x80\x9d the mootness of Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim and reach the oh-so-much-more-interesting question relating to her proposed collective action.  Ante, at 5.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut as this Court noted in a similar case, \xe2\x80\x9cassum[ing] what the facts will show to be ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d about a predicate question\xe2\x80\x94just because a party did not think to challenge settled Circuit precedent\xe2\x80\x94runs \xe2\x80\x9ca risk that ought  to be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374, \n382 (1995)\n.  The question Symczyk now raises (\xe2\x80\x9cDid an unaccepted settlement offer moot my individual FLSA claim?\xe2\x80\x9d) is logically prior to\xe2\x80\x94and thus inextricably intertwined with\xe2\x80\x94the question the majority rushes to resolve (\xe2\x80\x9cIf an unaccepted settlement offer mooted Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual FLSA claim, could a court proceed to consider her proposed collective action?\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the former is so much part and parcel of the latter that the question Genesis presented for our review\xe2\x80\x94 and on which we granted certiorari\xe2\x80\x94actually looks more like Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s than like the majority\xe2\x80\x99s.  Genesis asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether a case becomes moot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the lone plaintiff receives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Symczyk, of course, would respond \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d because merely receiving an offer does not moot any claim.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consider that obviously correct answer impedes \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent resolution of the question presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio v. Robinette, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, \n38 (1996)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  By taking a fallacy as its premise, the majority ensures it will reach the wrong decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill, you might think, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach has at least this benefit: In a future FLSA case, when an individual claim for damages in fact becomes moot, a court will know what to do with the collective allegations.  But no, even that much cannot be said for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  That is because the individual claims in such cases will never become moot, and a court will therefore never need to reach the issue the majority resolves.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision is fit for nothing: Aside from getting this case wrong, it serves only to address a make-believe problem.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo see why, consider how a collective FLSA action seeking damages unfolds.  A plaintiff (just like Symczyk, but let us now call her Smith, to highlight her typicality) sues under \xc2\xa7216(b) on behalf of both herself and others.  To determine whether Smith can serve as a representative party, the court considers whether the workplace policy her suit challenges has similarly affected other employees.  If it has, the court supervises their discovery and notification, and then \xe2\x80\x9coversee[s] the joinder\xe2\x80\x9d of any who want Smith to represent them.  Hoffman La-Roche Inc. v. Sperling, \n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 165, \n171 (1989)\n.  During that period, as  the majority observes, the class has no \xe2\x80\x9cindependent legal status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.  At the same time, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s own claim is in perfect health.  Because it is a damages claim for past conduct, the employer cannot extinguish it by adopting new employment practices.  Indeed, the claim would survive even Smith\xe2\x80\x99s own demise, belonging then to her estate.  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim, in short, is not going away on its own; it can easily wait out the time involved in assembling a collective action.  Accord, ante, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] claim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live until it is settled [or] judicially resolved\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNow introduce a settlement offer into the picture: Assume that before the court finally decides whether to permit a collective action, the defendant proposes to pay Smith the value of her individual claim in exchange for her abandonment of the entire litigation.  If Smith agrees, of course, all is over; like any plaintiff, she can assent to  a settlement ending her suit.  But assuming Smith does not agree, because she wishes to proceed on behalf of other employees, could the offer ever succeed in mooting her case?  I have already shown that it cannot do so in the circumstances here, where the defendant makes an offer, the plaintiff declines it, and nothing else occurs: On those facts, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claim is as it ever was, and the lawsuit continues onward.  But suppose the defendant addition- ally requests that the court enter judgment in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s favor\xe2\x80\x94though over her objection\xe2\x80\x94for the amount offered to satisfy her individual claim.  Could a court approve that motion and then declare the case over on the ground that Smith has no further stake in it?  That course would be less preposterous than what the court did here; at least Smith, unlike Symczyk, would get some money.  But it would be impermissible as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor starters, Rule 68 precludes a court from imposing judgment for a plaintiff like Smith based on an unaccepted settlement offer made pursuant to its terms.  The text of the Rule contemplates that a court will enter judgment only when a plaintiff accepts an offer.  See Rule 68(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the [plaintiff] serves written notice accepting the of- fer, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, plus proof of service.  The clerk must then enter judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Rule prohibits a court from considering an unaccepted offer for any purpose other than allocating litigation costs\xe2\x80\x94including for the purpose of entering judgment for either party.  See Rule 68(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs\xe2\x80\x9d).  That injunction accords with Rule 68\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive purpose: to promote voluntary cessation of litigation by imposing costs on plaintiffs who spurn certain settlement offers.  See Marek v. Chesny, \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n5 (1985)\n.  The Rule provides no appropriate mechanism for  a court to terminate a lawsuit without the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s  consent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does a court have inherent authority to enter an unwanted judgment for Smith on her individual claim, in service of wiping out her proposed collective action.  To be sure, a court has discretion to halt a lawsuit by entering judgment for the plaintiff when the defendant unconditionally surrenders and only the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy or madness prevents her from accepting total victory.  But the court may not take that tack when the supposed capitulation in fact fails to give the plaintiff all the law authorizes and she has sought.  And a judgment satisfying an individual claim does not give a plaintiff like Smith, exercising her right to sue on behalf of other employees, \xe2\x80\x9call that [she] has . . . requested in the complaint (i.e., relief for the class).\xe2\x80\x9d  Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper,  \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326, \n341 (1980)\n (Rehnquist, J., concurring).   No more in a collective action brought under the FLSA than in any other class action may a court, prior to certification, eliminate the entire suit by acceding to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to make only the named plaintiff whole.  That course would short-circuit a collective action before it could begin, and thereby frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give FLSA plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cthe opportunity to proceed collectively.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hoffman La-Roche, 493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 170; see Roper, 445  U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339.  It is our plaintiff Smith\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s or the court\xe2\x80\x99s, whether satisfaction of her individual claim, without redress of her viable classwide allegations, is sufficient to bring the lawsuit to an end.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd so, the question the majority answers should never arise\xe2\x80\x94which means the analysis the majority propounds should never apply.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The majority assumes that an individual claim has become moot, and then asks whether collective allegations can still proceed by virtue of the relation-back doctrine.  But that doctrine comes into play only when a court confronts a jurisdictional gap\xe2\x80\x94an individual claim becoming moot before the court can certify a representative action.  And in an FLSA case for damages, that gap cannot occur (unless a court, as here, mistakenly creates it): As I have explained, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim remains live all the way through the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to join new plaintiffs to the litigation.  Without any gap to span, the relation-back doctrine has no relevance.  Neither, then, does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court could have resolved this case (along with a Circuit split, see ante, at 5, and n.\xc2\xa03) by correcting the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that an unaccepted settlement offer mooted Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim.  Instead, the Court chose to address an issue predicated on that misconception, in a way that aids no one, now or ever.  I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority also justifies this approach on the ground that Symczyk did not file a cross-petition for certiorari objecting to the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But that is because Symczyk got the judgment she wanted in the Third Circuit.  As the majority agrees, a cross-petition is necessary only when a respondent seeks to \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d the judgment below.  Ante, at 5; see E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 490 (9th ed. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] party satisfied with the action of a lower court should not have to appeal from it in order to defend a judgment in his or her favor on any ground\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, the Third Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of Sym-czyk\xe2\x80\x99s FLSA suit, ruling that her collective action could go forward even though her individual claim was moot; accordingly, accepting Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s new argument would lead not to modifying the appellate judgment, but to affirming it on a different ground.  In any event, we have never held that the cross-petition requirement is jurisdictional.  See id., at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  We can choose to excuse the absence of a cross-petition for the same reasons, discussed next, that we can consider an issue not raised below.  See Vance v. Terrazas, \n\xe2\x80\x93259, n.\xc2\xa05 (1980).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0For similarly questionable deployment of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority, see Comcast Corp. v.

In each, we confronted a situation where a would-be class representative\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim became moot before a court could make a final decision about the propriety of class litigation; and in each, we used relation-back principles to preserve the court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to adjudicate on the merits the classwide questions the representative raised.  See, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, \n\xe2\x80\x9352 (1991); Swisher v. Brady, \n\xe2\x80\x93214, n.\xc2\xa011 (1978); Gerstein v.

If, counter-factually, Symczyk\xe2\x80\x99s individual claim became moot when she failed to accept Genesis\xe2\x80\x99s offer of judgment, her case would fit comfortably alongside those precedents.
