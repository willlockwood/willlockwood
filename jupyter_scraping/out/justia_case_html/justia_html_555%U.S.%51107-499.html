S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(42).  This so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpersecutor bar\xe2\x80\x9d applies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).  During the time petitioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds protected under \xc2\xa71101(a)(42).  After escaping to the United States, petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal.  Concluding that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, <em>inter alia,</em> that the persecutor bar applies even if the alien\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress.  The BIA followed its earlier decisions finding <em>Fedorenko</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/index.html">449 U. S. 490</a>, controlling.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its precedent following the same reasoning.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied <em>Fedorenko</em> as mandating that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immaterial for prosecutor-bar purposes.

S. 415</a>, 424\xe2\x80\x93425.  When the BIA has not spoken on \xe2\x80\x9ca matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary rule is to remand to allow \xe2\x80\x9cthe BIA \xe2\x80\xa6 to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Orlando Ventura</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/12/index.html">537 U.

In holding that voluntariness was not required with respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), <em>Fedorenko</em> contrasted the omission there of the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d with the word\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion in a related statutory subsection.  449 U. S., at 512.  Because Congress did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same significance as it did in <em>Fedorenko.  </em>Moreover, the DPA\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in persecution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror, see <em>id., </em>at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was enacted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and displaced persons, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Aguirre-Aguirre</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 427.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed <em>Chevron</em> deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented here.  In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has developed in its cases: An alien\xe2\x80\x99s motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue whether he \xe2\x80\x9cassisted\xe2\x80\x9d in persecution; rather, his actions\xe2\x80\x99 objective effect controls.  A reading of those decisions confirms that the BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has deemed its interpretation to be mandated by <em>Fedorenko.</em>  This error prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question presented.  Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in <em>Fedorenko</em>, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statutory purpose.  The BIA is not bound to apply the <em>Fedorenko</em> rule to the persecutor bar here at issue.  Whether the statute permits such an interpretation based on a different course of reasoning must be determined in the first instance by the agency.

S. 183</a>, 186, allowing it to bring its expertise to bear on the matter, evaluate the evidence, make an initial determination, and thereby help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 186\xe2\x80\x93187.

We hold that the BIA and the Court of Appeals misapplied <em>Fedorenko</em>.  We reverse and remand for the agency to interpret the statute, free from the error, in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner in this Court is Daniel Girmai Negusie, a dual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia, his father having been a national of the former and his mother of the latter.  Born and educated in Ethiopia, he left there for Eritrea around the age of 18 to see his mother and find employment.  The year was 1994.  After a few months in Eritrea, state officials took custody of petitioner and others when they were attending a movie.  He was forced to perform hard labor for a month and then was conscripted into the military for a time.  War broke out between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998, and he was conscripted again.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When petitioner refused to fight against Ethiopia, his other homeland, the Eritrean Government incarcerated him.  Prison guards punished petitioner by beating him with sticks and placing him in the hot sun.  He was released after two years and forced to work as a prison guard, a duty he performed on a rotating basis for about four years.  It is undisputed that the prisoners he guarded were being persecuted on account of a protected ground\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(42).  Petitioner testified that he carried a gun, guarded the gate to prevent escape, and kept prisoners from taking showers and obtaining fresh air.  He also guarded prisoners to make sure they stayed in the sun, which he knew was a form of punishment.  He saw at least one man die after being in the sun for more than two hours.  Petitioner testified that he had not shot at or directly punished any prisoner and that he helped prisoners on various occasions.  Petitioner escaped from the prison and hid in a container, which was loaded on board a ship heading to the United States.  Once here he applied for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a careful opinion the Immigration Judge, W. Wayne Stogner, found that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, for the most part, was credible.  He concluded that petitioner assisted in persecution by working as an armed guard.  The judge determined that although \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence to establish that [petitioner] is a malicious person or that he was an aggressive person who mistreated the prisoners, . . . the very fact that he helped [the government] in the prison compound where he had reason to know that they were persecuted constitutes assisting in the persecution of others and bars [petitioner] from\xe2\x80\x9d obtaining asylum or withholding of removal.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a\xe2\x80\x9317a (citing, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Fedorenko</em>, <em>supra</em>).  The judge, however, granted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding.  It noted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s role as an armed guard in a facility where \xe2\x80\x9cprisoners were tortured and left to die out in the sun . . . on account of a protected ground.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a.  The BIA held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that [petitioner] was compelled to participate as a prison guard, and may not have actively tortured or mistreated anyone, is immaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  That is because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he \xe2\x80\x9cassisted\xe2\x80\x9d in persecution . . .  [I]t is the objective effect of an alien\xe2\x80\x99s actions which is controlling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Matter of Fedorenko</em>, 19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 57, 69 (BIA 1984)).  The BIA also affirmed the grant of deferral of removal under CAT.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On petition for review the Court of Appeals agreed with the BIA that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immaterial for persecutor-bar purposes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a (citing <em>Fedorenko</em>, 449 U. S., at 512, n. 34).  We granted certiorari.  552 U.

S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93843 (1984), the BIA is entitled to deference in interpreting ambiguous provisions of the INA.  The question here is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in persecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal.  We conclude that the BIA misapplied our precedent in <em>Fedorenko</em> as mandating that an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien assisted in persecution.  The agency must confront the same question free of this mistaken legal premise.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well settled that \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of <em>Chevron</em> deference are applicable to this statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Aguirre-Aguirre</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/415/index.html">526 U. S. 415</a>, 424 (1999).  Congress has charged the Attorney General with administering the INA, and a \xe2\x80\x9cruling by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a)(1).  Judicial deference in the immigration context is of special importance, for executive officials \xe2\x80\x9cexercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Abudu</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/94/index.html">485 U. S. 94</a>, 100 (1988).  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision to bar an alien who has participated in persecution \xe2\x80\x9cmay affect our relations with [the alien\xe2\x80\x99s native] country or its neighbors.  The judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplomatic repercussions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aguirre-Aguirre</em>, 526 U. S., at 425.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Attorney General, in turn, has delegated to the BIA the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the course of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98considering and determining cases before it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting 8 CFR \xc2\xa73.1(d)(1) (1998)).  As a consequence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe BIA should be accorded <em>Chevron</em> deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms \xe2\x80\x98concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aguirre-Aguirre</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 425 (quoting <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html">480 U. S. 421</a>, 448\xe2\x80\x93449 (1987)).  When the BIA has not spoken on \xe2\x80\x9ca matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,\xe2\x80\x9d our ordinary rule is to remand to \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[e] the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Orlando Ventura</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/12/index.html">537 U.

As there is substance to both contentions, we conclude that the statute has an ambiguity that the agency should address in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language makes clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the persecutor bar because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98persecution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d presumes moral blameworthiness.  Brief for Petitioner 23\xe2\x80\x9328.  He invokes principles of criminal culpability, concepts of international law, and the rule of lenity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9345.  Those arguments may be persuasive in determining whether a particular agency interpretation is reasonable, but they do not demonstrate that the statute is unambiguous.  Petitioner all but conceded as much at argument in this Court when he indicated that the BIA has discretion to construe the duress defense in either a narrow or a broad way.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 20\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, on the other hand, asserts that the statute does not allow petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government says, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly answers that question: there is no exception\xe2\x80\x9d for conduct that is coerced because Congress did not include one.  Brief for Respondent 11.  We disagree.  The silence is not conclusive.  The question is whether the statutory text mandates that coerced actions must be deemed assistance in persecution.  On that point the statute, in its precise terms, is not explicit.  Nor is this a case where it is clear that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.  Cf. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 448\xe2\x80\x93449.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, like the BIA and the Court of Appeals, relies on <em>Fedorenko </em>to provide the answer.  This reliance is not without some basis, as the Court there held that voluntariness was not required with respect to another persecutor bar.  449 U. S., at 512.  To the extent, however, the Government deems <em>Fedorenko</em> to be controlling, it is in error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Fedorenko</em>, the Court interpreted the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009.  The DPA was enacted \xe2\x80\x9cto enable European refugees driven from their homelands by the [second world] war to emigrate to the United States without regard to traditional immigration quotas.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S., at 495.  Section 2(b) of the DPA provides relief to \xe2\x80\x9cany displaced person or refugee as defined in Annex I of the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization\xe2\x80\x9d of the United Nations (IRO Constitution).  62 Stat. 1009.  The IRO Constitution, as codified by Congress, excludes any individual \xe2\x80\x9cwho can be shown: (a) to have assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of countries, Members of the United Nations; or (b) to have voluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of the second world war in their operations against the United Nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Annex I, Part II, \xc2\xa72, 62 Stat. 3051\xe2\x80\x933052.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Fedorenko</em> Court held that \xe2\x80\x9can individual\xe2\x80\x99s service as a concentration camp armed guard\xe2\x80\x94whether voluntary or involuntary\xe2\x80\x94made him ineligible for a visa\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72(a) of the IRO Constitution.  449 U. S., at 512.  That Congress did not adopt a voluntariness requirement for \xc2\xa72(a), the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cis plain from comparing \xc2\xa72(a) with \xc2\xa72(b), which excludes only those individuals who \xe2\x80\x98<em>voluntarily</em> assisted the enemy forces.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court relied on the principle of statutory construction that \xe2\x80\x9cthe deliberate omission of the word \xe2\x80\x98voluntary\xe2\x80\x99 from \xc2\xa72(a) compels the conclusion that the statute made <em>all</em> those who assisted in persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fedorenko</em> does not compel the same conclusion in the case now before us.  The textual structure of the statute in <em>Fedorenko</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d is in one subsection but not the other) is not part of the statutory framework considered here.  Congress did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d in any subsection of the persecutor bar, so its omission cannot carry the same significance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difference between the statutory scheme in <em>Fedorenko</em> and the one here is confirmed when we \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98look not only to the particular statutory language, but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dada</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/1/index.html">554 U.

Both statutes were enacted to reflect principles set forth in international agreements, but the principles differ in significant respects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As discussed, Congress enacted the DPA in 1948 as part of an international effort to address individuals who were forced to leave their homelands during and after the second World War.  <em>Fedorenko</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495.  The DPA excludes those who \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of the second world war,\xe2\x80\x9d 62 Stat. 3052, as well as all who \xe2\x80\x9cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of countries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 3051.  The latter exclusion clause makes no reference to culpability.  The exclusion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in Nazi persecution, as an expert testified in <em>Fedorenko</em>, may be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[b]ecause the crime against humanity that is involved in the concentration camp puts it into a different category.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S., at 511, n. 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The persecutor bar in this case, by contrast, was enacted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980.  Unlike the DPA, which was enacted to address not just the post war refugee problem but also the Holocaust and its horror, the Refugee Act was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and displaced persons.  As this Court has twice recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 primary purposes\xe2\x80\x99 in passing the Refugee Act was to implement the principles agreed to in the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U.

Whatever weight or relevance these various authorities may have in interpreting the statute should be considered by the agency in the first instance, and by any subsequent reviewing court, after our remand.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that \xe2\x80\x9cif there were any ambiguity in the text, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the bar contains no such exception is reasonable and thus controlling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 11.  Whether such an interpretation would be reasonable, and thus owed <em>Chevron</em> deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not now before us.  The BIA deemed its interpretation to be mandated by <em>Fedorenko</em>, and that error prevented it from a full consideration of the statutory question here presented.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In denying relief in this case the BIA recited a rule that has developed in its own case law in reliance on <em>Fedorenko:</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n alien\xe2\x80\x99s motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he \xe2\x80\x98assisted\xe2\x80\x99 in persecution . . .  [I]t is the objective effect of an alien\xe2\x80\x99s actions which is controlling.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a.  The rule is based on three earlier decisions: <em>Matter of Laipenieks</em>, 18 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 433 (1983); <em>Matter of Fedorenko</em>, 19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 57; and <em>Matter of Rodriguez-Majano</em>, 19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 811 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Matter of Laipenieks</em>, the BIA applied the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Fedorenko</em> analysis of the DPA to a different postwar statute, which provided for the deportation of anyone associated with the Nazis who \xe2\x80\x9cordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated\xe2\x80\x9d in persecution based on a protected ground.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i).  Finding no agency or judicial decision on point, the BIA relied on <em>Fedorenko</em>.  It recognized that the unique structure of the <em>Fedorenko</em> statute was not present in \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i), but the BIA nevertheless adopted wholesale the <em>Fedorenko</em> rule: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s in <em>Fedorenko</em>, . . . the plain language of [\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] mandates a literal interpretation, and the omission of an intent element compels the conclusion that [\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] makes all those who assisted in the specific persecution deportable.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 464.  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9cparticular motivations or intent . . . is not a relevant factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second decision, <em>Matter of Fedorenko</em>, also dealt with \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i), and it involved the same alien whose citizenship was revoked by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Fedorenko</em> decision.  This time the agency sought to deport him.  Fedorenko responded by requesting suspension of deportation.  He argued that, unlike the DPA\xe2\x80\x99s bar on any assistance\xe2\x80\x94voluntary or involuntary\xe2\x80\x94in persecution, see <em>Fedorenko</em>, 449 U. S., at 512, the text and structure of \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i) required deportation only of those who voluntarily assisted in persecuting others.  The BIA rejected that distinction, noting that it was foreclosed by <em>Matter of Laipenieks:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be, as [Fedorenko] argues, that his service at Treblinka was involuntary. . . .  We need not resolve the issue, however, because as a matter of law [Fedorenko\xe2\x80\x99s] motivations for serving as a guard at Treblinka are immaterial to the question of his deportability under\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E)(i).  19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 69\xe2\x80\x9370.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Later, the BIA applied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Fedorenko</em> rule to the persecutor bar that is at issue in the present case.  In <em>Matter of Rodriguez-Majano</em>, the BIA granted relief because the alien\xe2\x80\x99s coerced conduct as a guerrilla was not persecution based on a protected ground.  19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 815\xe2\x80\x93816.  Nevertheless, in reaching its conclusion the BIA incorporated without additional analysis the <em>Fedorenko</em> rule as applied in <em>Matter of Laipenieks</em> and reiterated in <em>Matter of Fedorenko</em>.  19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 814\xe2\x80\x93815.  The BIA reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he participation or assistance of an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to bar him from relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 814 (citing <em>Fedorenko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/index.html"></a><a href="/us/449/490/index.html">449 U. S. 490</a>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our reading of these decisions confirms that the BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has determined that <em>Fedorenko</em> controls.  This mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize the inapplicability of the principle of statutory construction invoked in <em>Fedorenko</em>, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statutory purpose.  The BIA is not bound to apply the <em>Fedorenko</em> rule that motive and intent are irrelevant to the persecutor bar at issue in this case.  Whether the statute permits such an interpretation based on a different course of reasoning must be determined in the first instance by the agency.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that the BIA has not yet exercised its <em>Chevron</em> discretion to interpret the statute in question, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/183/index.html">547 U.

This remand rule exists, in part, because \xe2\x80\x9cambiguities in statutes within an agency\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.  Filling these gaps . . . involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U.

That approach, however, is in tension with the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary \xe2\x80\x98remand\xe2\x80\x99 rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ventura</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 18; see also <em>Cajun Elec.

(\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f an agency erroneously contends that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on that ground, we remand to require the agency to consider the question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Thomas</em> is illustrative.  There, the agency had not determined whether a family may constitute a social group for the purposes of refugee status.  The Ninth Circuit held that the family can constitute a protected social group and that the particular family at issue did qualify.  547 U. S., at 184\xe2\x80\x93185.  The Solicitor General sought review in this Court on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions by the relevant administrative agency, that members of a family can and do constitute a particular social group, within the meaning of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 185 (internal quotation marks omitted).  He argued that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision violated the <em>Ventura</em> ordinary remand rule.  We agreed and summarily reversed.  547 U.

Because of the important differences between the statute before us and the one at issue in <em>Fedorenko</em>, we find it appropriate to remand to the agency for its initial determination of the statutory interpretation question and its application to this case.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statutory meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cpersecution\xe2\x80\x9d may be explained by a more comprehensive definition, one designed to elaborate on the term in anticipation of a wide range of potential conduct; and that expanded definition in turn may be influenced by how practical, or impractical, the standard would be in terms of its application to specific cases.  These matters may have relevance in determining whether its statutory interpretation is a permissible one.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court said in <em>Ventura</em> and reiterated in <em>Thomas</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U. S., at 186\xe2\x80\x93187 (quoting <em>Ventura</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 17).  If the BIA decides to adopt a standard that considers voluntariness to some degree, it may be prudent and necessary for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional factfinding based on the new standard.

I agree that the agency is entitled to answer that question.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984).  And I agree that a remand is in order, to give the agency an opportunity to clarify whether its affirmative answer was premised on an erroneous view that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Fedorenko</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/index.html">449 U. S. 490</a> (1981), compelled it.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would not agree to remand if I did not think that the agency has the option of adhering to its decision.  The majority appears to leave that question undecided, <em>ante</em>, at 5 (reserving whether \xe2\x80\x9ca particular agency interpretation is reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d); two Justices forthrightly disagree and would require the agency to recognize at least some sort of duress exception, <em>post</em>, at 7 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But good reasons for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s current practice exist\xe2\x80\x94reasons adequate to satisfy the requirement that an agency act reasonably in choosing among various possible constructions of an ambiguous statute.  The statute does not mandate the rule precluding the duress defense but does not foreclose it either; the agency is free to retain that rule so long as the choice to do so is soundly reasoned, not based on irrelevant or arbitrary factors (like the <em>Fedorenko</em> precedent).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The primary contention to the contrary is, in short, that barring aliens who persecuted under duress would punish purely \xe2\x80\x9cnonculpable\xe2\x80\x9d conduct.  That argument suffers from at least three unjustified leaps of logic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it implicitly adopts a view of \xe2\x80\x9cculpability\xe2\x80\x9d that is neither the only view nor one necessarily applicable here.  The culpability of one who harms another under coercion is, and has always been, a subject of intense debate, raising profound questions of moral philosophy and individual responsibility.  (The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cNuremberg defense\xe2\x80\x9d comes readily to mind.)  At common law, duress was not an accepted defense to intentional killing, see 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa79.7(b), pp.\xc2\xa074\xe2\x80\x9375 (2d ed. 2003); and in modern times, some states do not allow it as a defense to lesser crimes, see <em>id.</em>, at 81\xe2\x80\x9382, and n. 50.  Notably, there is no historical support for the duress defense when a soldier follows a military order he knows to be unlawful.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>\xc2\xa79.7(g), at 86; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Axtell\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, Kel. J. 13, 84 Eng. Rep. 1060 (1660); <em>Prosecutor</em> v. <em>Erdemovi<f f="Century Schoolbook CE">\xc3\xa6</f></em><f f="Century Schoolbook">, [1997] 2 ICTY Jud. Rep. 1610, 1635 (Int\xe2\x80\x99l Crim. Trib. for Former Yugoslavia).  It is therefore far from clear that precluding a duress defense here would, as petitioner alleges, \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard principles of blame . . . \xe2\x80\x98universal and persistent\xe2\x80\x99 in American law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/246/index.html">342 U. S. 246</a>, 250 (1952)).  All of this suggests that those who are coerced to commit wrong are at least <em>sometimes</em> \xe2\x80\x9cculpable\xe2\x80\x9d enough to be treated as criminals.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, this is not a criminal matter.  This Court has long understood that an \xe2\x80\x9corder of deportation is not a punishment for crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fong Yue Ting</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/149/698/index.html">149 U. S. 698</a>, 730 (1893).  Asylum is a benefit accorded by grace, not by entitlement, and withholding that benefit from all who have intentionally harmed others\xe2\x80\x94whether under coercion or not\xe2\x80\x94is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, petitioner assumes that the persecutor bar must have been intended merely to punish wrongdoing.  But in the context of immigration law, \xe2\x80\x9cculpability\xe2\x80\x9d as a relevant factor in determining admissibility is only one facet of a more general consideration: desirability.  And there may well be reasons to think that those who persecuted others, even under duress, would be relatively undesirable as immigrants.  If, for example, the asylum laws grant entry to those who suffered the persecution, might it not be imprudent to also grant entry to the coerced persecutor, who may end up living in the same community as one of his victims?  The Nation has a legitimate interest in preventing the importation of ethnic strife from remote parts of the world, and the agency may resolve the statutory ambiguity in a way that safeguards that interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, <em>even if</em> culpability is the only relevant factor, and <em>even if</em> a narrow, criminal-law based view of culpability is the authoritative one, a bright-line rule excluding all persecutors\xe2\x80\x94whether acting under coercion or not\xe2\x80\x94might <em>still</em> be the best way for the agency to effectuate the statutory scheme.  See generally Cox &amp; Posner, Second-Order Structure of Immigration Law, 59 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 809 (2007).  Immigration judges already face the overwhelming task of attempting to recreate, by a limited number of witnesses speaking through (often poor-quality) translation, events that took place years ago in foreign, usually impoverished countries.  See <em>Dia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 353 F.\xc2\xa03d 228, 261\xe2\x80\x93262 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Adding on top of that the burden of adjudicating claims of duress and coercion, which are extremely difficult to corroborate and necessarily pose questions of degree that require intensely fact-bound line-drawing, would increase the already inherently high risk of error.  And the <em>cost</em> of error (viz., allowing <em>un</em>coerced persecutors to remain in the country permanently) might reasonably be viewed by the agency as significantly greater than the cost of overinclusion under a bright-line rule (viz., denial of asylum to some coerced persecutors\xe2\x80\x94who might anyway be entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture, which includes no analogous persecutor bar).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is worth noting that although the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobjective effects\xe2\x80\x9d approach to the statute would seem to sweep beyond the duress scenario to encompass even an alien who had no idea that his actions would \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively\xe2\x80\x9d assist in persecution, see <em>Casta\xc5\x84eda-Castillo </em>v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 488 F.\xc2\xa03d 17, 20 (CA1 2007) (en banc), there is no reason why the agency cannot consider questions of <em>knowledge</em> separate and apart from questions of <em>duress</em>.  Both can be said to relate to the mental state of the persecutor,*<footcall num="*"> but they present different problems which can be grappled with separately.  The agency need not provide an \xe2\x80\x9call-embracing answer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, in the present case.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Fedorenko</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/index.html"></a><a href="/us/449/490/index.html">449 U. S. 490</a> (1981), held that the statute does not require that the persecution be voluntarily inflicted.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court, <em>Fedorenko</em>, which construed the similar text of a persecution bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the question presented here.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, 9\xe2\x80\x9310; see also <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Scalia, J., concurring).  The majority further holds that the INA is ambiguous as to \xe2\x80\x9cwhether coercion or duress is relevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise participated in persecution\xe2\x80\x9d and that the agency, therefore, should interpret the statute in the first instance to determine whether it reasonably can be read to include a voluntariness requirement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, 10\xe2\x80\x9312; see also <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring).  I disagree with both of these conclusions.  Because the INA unambiguously precludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted voluntarily, <em>i.e.</em>, free from coercion or duress, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie testified to the Immigration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work as an armed guard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where prisoners were persecuted because of their religious beliefs.  According to petitioner, part of his job was \xe2\x80\x9cto firmly control the prisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by exposing them\xe2\x80\x9d to the extreme heat of the African sun.  App. 58.  The guards \xe2\x80\x9cwould \xe2\x80\xa6 hold [a] stick [with] their hand\xe2\x80\x9d and follow prisoners who were being forced to \xe2\x80\x9croll on the ground in the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 23.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cit was extremely hot,\xe2\x80\x9d prisoners would quickly \xe2\x80\x9cget tired and [feel] shortness of breath and stop\xe2\x80\x9d rolling.  <em>Id.,</em> at 24.  They were then beaten.  Prisoners typically could not survive this punishment for more than two hours.  Indeed, at least one prisoner died from sun exposure while petitioner stood guard.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner testified that, as a guard, he prevented the prisoners from showering and forbade them from leaving their rooms for fresh air.  This form of punishment was particularly severe because the prisons were \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt from stone and bricks\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cno cooling system, no ventilation, no windows,\xe2\x80\x9d and intolerable heat.  App. 20, 30.  Petitioner also prevented prisoner escapes, for which the punishment was forced sun exposure. And, although petitioner never used \xe2\x80\x9celectricity to torture\xe2\x80\x9d prisoners, he was aware that his supervisor did.  <em>Id.,</em> at 61\xe2\x80\x9362.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But petitioner, who had converted to Protestantism when he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also testified that he did not want to persecute any of the prisoners because his new religion taught him \xe2\x80\x9cto be merciful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 34.  Thus, at times he disobeyed his orders.  On one occasion, he gave water to a prisoner who was dying from sun exposure.  On another occasion, he let female prisoners take showers after they had been denied that privilege \xe2\x80\x9cfor a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 37.  Petitioner also occasionally allowed some of the prisoners to \xe2\x80\x9cgo outside during the night and during the evenings and \xe2\x80\xa6 refresh themselves in the fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After four years as a prison guard, petitioner deserted his post, swam to a shipping container, and hid inside.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (majority opinion).  The container arrived in the United States with petitioner inside on December 20, 2004.  Petitioner applied for asylum and the withholding of removal under the INA, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq.  </em>He also applied for protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), under which it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\xe2\x80\x9d  Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, \xc2\xa72242(a), 112 Stat. 2681\xe2\x80\x93822, note following 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231, p. 263 (United States Policy with Respect to Involuntary Return of Persons in Danger of Subjection to Torture (hereinafter CAT Policy)).  See also CAT, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\xe2\x80\x9320, 1465 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 85.  Petitioner feared that, if returned to Eritrea, he would \xe2\x80\x9cbe executed\xe2\x80\x9d because he had converted to Protestantism and deserted his military post.  App. 65, 68.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The INA provides the Executive with the discretion to grant asylum to aliens that are \xe2\x80\x9cunable or unwilling\xe2\x80\x9d to return to their home country \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1).  The INA also requires the Executive to withhold removal of aliens to a country in which there is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear probability\xe2\x80\x9d that their \xe2\x80\x9clife or freedom would be threatened\xe2\x80\x9d because of their \xe2\x80\x9crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71231(b)(3)(A).  However, the INA prohibits the Executive from granting asylum or withholding removal if an alien \xe2\x80\x9cordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution\xe2\x80\x9d of any person on account of \xe2\x80\x9crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71158(b)(2)(A)(i) (asylum); \xc2\xa71231(b)(3)(B) (withholding of removal).  Nonetheless, in light of the CAT\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State Party shall \xe2\x80\xa6 return \xe2\x80\xa6 a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\xe2\x80\x9320, at 20, regulations implementing that convention provide \xe2\x80\x9cdeferral of removal\xe2\x80\x9d to aliens subject to the INA persecutor bar who would more likely than not be tortured if removed to their home country.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71208.16(c)(4), (d)(2), 1208.17(a) (2008); see also CAT Policy (b), at 263 (requiring federal agencies to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3 of the [CAT], subject to any reservations, understandings, declarations, and provisos contained in the United States Senate resolution of ratification of the Convention\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The IJ denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s applications for asylum and the withholding of removal, but granted him deferral of removal.  The BIA affirmed.  In their view, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conduct objectively qualified as assistance or participation in the persecution of others based on religion.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (majority opinion).  Relying on <em>Fedorenko</em>, the IJ and BIA found that even if petitioner was \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled to participate as a prison guard\xe2\x80\x9d against his wishes, his \xe2\x80\x9cmotivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he \xe2\x80\x98assisted\xe2\x80\x99 in persecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (some internal quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, petitioner was ineligible for asylum or the withholding of removal under the INA.  The IJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner qualified for deferral of removal because it is \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not that he would be tortured\xe2\x80\x9d if returned to Eritrea given that its \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment has used deadly force and threatened to use deadly force against deserters.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a\xe2\x80\x938a, 20a, 19a.

As the majority acknowledges, see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, the text of the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar neither includes the term \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d nor contains an exception for involuntary, coerced conduct.  The statute instead applies to <em>any</em> alien \xe2\x80\x9cwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person\xe2\x80\x9d on account of a protected ground.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s key terms also do not imply any voluntariness requirement for persecution.  Under the ordinary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersecution\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the act of persecution alone is sufficient to classify one\xe2\x80\x99s conduct as persecution.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 877 (1991) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cpersecution\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe act or practice of persecuting esp. those who differ in origin, religion, or social outlook\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New Collegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s) (same).  The term itself includes no intrinsic <em>mens rea</em> requirement.  As a result, an individual can \xe2\x80\x9cpersecute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning \xe2\x80\x9charass in a manner designed to injure, grieve, or afflict\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without having designed the act or intended for injury, grief, or affliction to occur.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth 877; see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 855 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The persecutor bar\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of those who \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d confirms that it does not include a voluntariness requirement.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cto give support or aid,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth 109, or \xe2\x80\x9cto help,\xe2\x80\x9d Oxford American Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford).  See also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o help; aid; succor; lend countenance or encouragement to; participate in as an auxiliary\xe2\x80\x9d).  And \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d means simply \xe2\x80\x9cto take part,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth 858, or \xe2\x80\x9cto have a share, to take part in something,\xe2\x80\x9d Oxford 487; see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1007 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to partake of; experience in common with others; to have or enjoy a part or share in common with others\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary meanings of \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d do not \xe2\x80\x9cconnote voluntariness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U.

Even if participation or assistance is coerced, it remains participation or assistance just the same.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the particular statutory section of the INA before the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cthe language and design of the statute as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d is instructive in determining the provision\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  <em>K mart Corp., supra</em>, at 291; see also <em>Amoco Production Co.</em> v. <em>Gambell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/531/index.html">480 U. S. 531</a>, 552\xe2\x80\x93553 (1987).  Here, the INA\xe2\x80\x99s design and structure buttress the conclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of voluntariness.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Congress has evidenced its ability to both specifically require voluntary conduct and explicitly exclude involuntary conduct in other provisions of the INA.  See <em>infra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  For example, Congress has barred admission to the United States of totalitarian party members unless their membership was \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(D)(ii), and it has provided for the termination of asylum when an alien \xe2\x80\x9chas voluntarily availed himself or herself\xe2\x80\x9d of another country\xe2\x80\x99s protections, \xc2\xa71158(c)(2)(D). \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello, supra</em>, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U. S. 438</a>, 452\xe2\x80\x93454 (2002). The absence of a voluntariness requirement in the INA persecutor bar is no exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, federal immigration law provides calibrated remedies, which include partial refuge for specified aliens who have both suffered from and inflicted persecution.  Those who have been persecuted and have not engaged in persecution may receive both asylum and the withholding of removal.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A).  Those at the other end of the spectrum, who have not been persecuted but have persecuted others, may not receive either asylum or the withholding of removal. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71231(b)(3)(B)(i), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i).  And finally, for many individuals who (like petitioner) have both persecuted others and been persecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they will receive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will face torture upon their return to their home country. CAT Policy (a), at 263; see also 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71208.13(a), 1208.16(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d courts should not read one part of the legislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and conflicting, solution to a problem that has already been specifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigration regime (regulations implementing the CAT).  <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 519 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also<em> Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/index.html">444 U. S. 11</a>, 19 (1979).  Federal law provides only partial protection to a victim of persecution who has also engaged in persecution, voluntarily or not.  There simply is no justification for writing into the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the withholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into engaging in persecution.  That is, the \xe2\x80\x9cassumption of inadvertent omission\xe2\x80\x9d of a voluntariness requirement in the INA \xe2\x80\x9cis rendered especially suspect upon close consideration of [a statute\xe2\x80\x99s] interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme\xe2\x80\x9d that addresses the specific problem at issue in a conflicting way.  <em>Massachusetts Mut.

In 1950, Congress added a second persecutor bar to the DPA that applied \xe2\x80\x9cto any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa713, 64 Stat. 227.  In the years that followed, Congress continued to use this same broad language in denying asylum to specific categories of persecutors.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying permanent residence to aliens from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia \xe2\x80\x9cwho ordered, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, or political opinion\xe2\x80\x9d); 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(E), 1227(a)(4)(D)) (authorizing the exclusion of anyone who had been associated with Nazi forces and had \xe2\x80\x9cordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa714(a), 67 Stat. 406 (imposing persecutor bar on \xe2\x80\x9cany person who personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of \xe2\x80\xa6 [a] group of persons because of race, religion, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress then enacted the INA bar in 1980.  This statute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor \xe2\x80\x9cany person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201(a), 94 Stat. 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  Congress reenacted the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar in 1996 and retained its breadth.  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7305(b)(3)(B)(i), 601(a)(1), 604(b)(2)(A)(i), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93602, 689, 691.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 uninterrupted use of this broad statutory language, which parallels the persecutor bars dating back to 1948, was not accidental.  By the time of the 1996 reenactment, this Court had specifically interpreted the plain language of the predecessor bars to apply regardless of the voluntariness of a persecutor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  See <em>Fedorenko, supra</em>, at 512 (1948 DPA bar); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Koreh</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d 431, 439 (CA3 1995) (1950 DPA bar); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schmidt</em>, 923 F.\xc2\xa02d 1253, 1258 (CA7 1991) (1948 DPA bar);  <em>Maikovskis </em>v. <em>INS</em>, 773 F.\xc2\xa02d 435, 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (CA2 1985) (8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a)(19) (1982 ed.), transferred to \xc2\xa71227(a)(4)(D) (2006 ed.)).  In particular, this Court had held that the phrase in the 1948 DPA bar, \xe2\x80\x9cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians],\xe2\x80\x9d contained no \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98involuntary assistance\xe2\x80\x99 exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fedorenko, </em>449 U.

Rather, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain language\xe2\x80\x9d made clear that \xe2\x80\x9can individual\xe2\x80\x99s service as a concentration camp armed guard\xe2\x80\x94whether voluntary or involuntary\xe2\x80\x94made him ineligible for a visa.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this legal backdrop, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decisions in 1980 and 1996 to retain a persecutor bar that broadly applies to anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cassisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution\xe2\x80\x9d of any person, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B), is significant evidence that Congress did not intend to include any involuntariness exception in the INA bar.  This Court must assume, absent textual proof to the contrary, that Congress was aware of the <em>Fedorenko </em>decision when it reenacted the persecutor bar and thus \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed the] statute without change,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lorillard</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 580.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar does not require that assistance or participation in persecution be voluntary or uncoerced to fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  It instead \xe2\x80\x9cmandates precisely\xe2\x80\x9d what it says: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n individual\xe2\x80\x99s service as a [prison] camp armed guard\xe2\x80\x94whether voluntary or involuntary\xe2\x80\x94ma[kes] him ineligible for\xe2\x80\x9d asylum or withholding of removal if the guard\xe2\x80\x99s service involved assistance or participation in the persecution of another person on account of a protected ground.  <em>Fedorenko, supra</em>, at 512.  Here, it is undisputed that petitioner served at a prison camp where guards persecuted prisoners because of their religious beliefs.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (majority opinion). It also is undisputed that petitioner carried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from escaping and by standing guard while at least one prisoner died from sun exposure.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Petitioner, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cassisted, or otherwise participated\xe2\x80\x9d in persecution and thus is statutorily disqualified from receiving asylum or withholding of removal under the INA.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority nevertheless concludes the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csilence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 6, creates ambiguity, and therefore remands the case to the BIA for it to determine, in the first instance, whether persecution must be voluntary to fall within the terms of the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to derive ambiguity from th[e] utmost clarity\xe2\x80\x9d of the persecutor bar, however, \xe2\x80\x9care unconvincing\xe2\x80\x9d in every respect.  <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U.

But a statute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court \xe2\x80\x9cexhaust[s] the aid of the \xe2\x80\x98traditional tools of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and determines that Congress did not resolve the issue under consideration.  <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/371/index.html">543 U. S. 371</a>, 402 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9).  Deeming a statute with broad terms to be ambiguous for that reason alone essentially requires Congress either to obey a judicially imposed clear-statement rule or accept the risk that the courts may refuse to give full effect to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning in the name of <em>Chevron</em> deference.  Not every difficult question of statutory construction amounts to a statutory gap for a federal  agency to fill.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  And the Court should not, \xe2\x80\x9cin the name of deference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a statute\xe2\x80\x9d simply because it requires some effort.  <em>Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc.</em> v. <em>Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/45/index.html">550 U. S. 45</a>, 77 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority makes no attempt to apply the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional tools of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x9d to the persecutor bar before retreating to ambiguity.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Rather, it merely observes that Congress could have spoken more directly to the issue, which it finds sufficient to render the statute ambiguous on this score.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But the absence of a phrase specifying that the provision applies to both involuntary and voluntary conduct is not definitive proof of ambiguity.  It is certainly correct that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98could have spoken in clearer terms,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Clark</em>, 543 U. S., at 402 (Thomas, J., dissenting), as it almost always can in any statute.  However, this \xe2\x80\x9cproves nothing\xe2\x80\x9d in evaluating whether the statute is ambiguous.  <em>Ibid. </em> The question before the Court instead is whether Congress has provided an unambiguous answer in the plain language that it chose to use.  Here, for the reasons just explained, the traditional tools of statutory interpretation show with \xe2\x80\x9cutmost clarity,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> St. Cyr, supra</em>, at 329, that the statute applies regardless of the voluntariness of the alien who participates or assists in persecution.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also finds ambiguity based on differences between the INA and the DPA statutory bar considered in <em>Fedorenko</em>.  In particular, the majority points to the <em>Fedorenko </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a second part of the DPA persecutor bar, which applied to those who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>voluntarily</em> assisted the enemy forces \xe2\x80\xa6 in their operations against the United Nations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S., at 495, and n.\xc2\xa03 (quoting 62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added).  The Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction, the deliberate omission of the word \xe2\x80\x98voluntary\xe2\x80\x99 from \xc2\xa72(a),\xe2\x80\x9d which addressed the assistance of persecution\xe2\x80\x94but not from \xc2\xa72(b)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccompel[led] the conclusion that the statute made <em>all</em> those who assisted in the persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 512.  According to the majority, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar, does not include a provision limited by the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d adjacent to the provision that is not so limited, the absence of the adverb here cannot carry the significance given it in <em>Fedorenko</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is flawed. The mere fact that the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar is not accompanied by a neighboring provision containing the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d does not negate the significance of the term\xe2\x80\x99s absence when other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions undertaken voluntarily.  As noted above, see <em>supra,</em> at 7, the INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of statutory provisions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71158(c)(2)(D) (terminating asylum when alien has \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d availed himself of the protection of his country); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(D)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii) (denying admission and naturalization to those who have been members of, or affiliated with, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Communist or any other totalitarian party\xe2\x80\x9d unless that membership or affiliation was \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily<em> </em>and knowingly\xe2\x80\x9d engaged in, endorsed, espoused, or persuaded others to endorse, espouse, or support terrorist activity); \xc2\xa71229c(a)(1) (allowing an alien to \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d depart the United States); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71424(a), (d) (precluding naturalization for members of certain totalitarian parties, unless membership was \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d performing certain specified acts with the intention of relinquishing nationality).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the immigration and naturalization context, then, Congress is certainly capable of declaring its preference for a voluntariness requirement.  That Congress\xe2\x80\x99 explicit references to voluntariness appear in other sections of this particular statutory scheme, rather than in subsections of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158 or 1231, is immaterial.  Cf.<em> Rusello, </em>464 U. S., at 23; <em>Barnhart</em>, 534 U. S., at 452\xe2\x80\x93454.  And the fact that Congress, in the course of making structural revisions to the statutory regime, eliminated the specific dichotomy the Court noted in <em>Fedorenko</em> does not undermine the critical point: The INA expressly includes a voluntariness requirement in several places but does not impose such a requirement in the persecution bar.  Thus, the omission of the word \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d from the persecutor bar in the INA is just as conclusive as its omission from the persecutor bar in the DPA.  With respect to both statutes, the deliberate omission \xe2\x80\x9ccompels the conclusion that the statute made <em>all</em> those who assisted in the persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S., at 512.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority concludes that the DPA bar is distinguishable from the INA bar because the former was enacted in the context of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9ccrime against humanity that [was] involved in the concentration camp,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which was so horrific that it is in a category all its own.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting <em>Fedorenko, supra</em>, at 511, n. 32).  In that unique context, the majority reasons, it made sense to exclude \xe2\x80\x9ceven those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in Nazi persecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But the majority cannot intend to suggest that all acts of persecution during the Second World War were inherently more depraved or reprehensible than all acts of persecution that have occurred in the decades since the INA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certainly, no such conclusion is compelled by the statutory text.  Congress has steadfastly condemned <em>all</em> acts of persecution.  See 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76401(a)(5)\xe2\x80\x93(7) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has recognized and denounced acts of religious persecution,\xe2\x80\x9d which can be \xe2\x80\x9csevere and violent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in countries with militant politicized religious majorities\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa76401(b)(5) (announcing that it is the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] with the persecuted\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7501, 78 Stat. 1015 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Congress condemns the persecution of any persons because of their religion\xe2\x80\x9d); Refugee Act of 1980, \xc2\xa7101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Congress declares that it is the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no reason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning based on a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980, could not have meant to oppose persecution quite as intensely as it did in the aftermath of World War II.  Rather, the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar naturally extends to all acts of persecution and, therefore, requires the denial of asylum and withholding of removal for \xe2\x80\x9ceven those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in \xe2\x80\xa6 persecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I conclude that the INA\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor bar applies whether or not petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s assistance or participation in persecution was voluntary, and because it is conceded that petitioner assisted and participated in persecution while serving as an armed prison guard in Eritrea, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B), disqualifies from asylum or withholding of removal an alien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product of duress.  If the answer to that threshold question is \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d courts should defer to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of particular circumstances that may or may not establish duress or coercion in individual cases.  But the threshold question the Court addresses today is a \xe2\x80\x9cpure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/421/index.html">480 U. S. 421</a>, 446 (1987).  For that reason, while I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cogent explanation of why its misguided decision in <em>Fedorenko</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/490/index.html">449 U. S. 490</a> (1981), does not govern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, I would provide a definite answer to the question presented and then remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judicial deference to agencies\xe2\x80\x99 views on statutes they administer was not born in <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U.

S. 974</a>, 988 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting), die with that case.  In the years before <em>Chevron</em>, this Court recognized that statutory interpretation is a multifaceted enterprise, ranging from a precise construction of statutory language to a determination of what policy best effectuates statutory objectives.  We accordingly acknowledged that a complete interpretation of a statutory provision might demand both judicial construction and administrative explication.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Hearst Publications, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/322/111/index.html">322 U. S. 111</a> (1944) (construing the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d in the National Labor Relations Act but deferring to the National Labor Relations Board\xe2\x80\x99s finding that newsboys were employees); see Nathanson, Administrative Discretion in the Interpretation of Statutes, 3 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 470 (1950).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Chevron </em>adhered to this approach.  There, we recognized that the Clean Air Act did not define \xe2\x80\x9cstationary source,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77502(b)(6) (1982 ed.), but rather implicitly delegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the policy question whether States could treat entire plants or only their discrete pollution-emitting devices as sources of pollution for purposes of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s permit program.  Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and the agency brought its expertise, political acuity, and information-gathering abilities to bear in doing so.<em> </em>See<em> Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 865\xe2\x80\x93866.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In keeping with precedent, see <em>id.</em>, at 843\xe2\x80\x93845, and nn.\xc2\xa09, 11\xe2\x80\x9314, our opinion reaffirmed both that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 843, n.\xc2\xa09, and that courts should defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable formulation of policy in response to an explicit or implicit congressional delegation of authority.  The <em>Chevron </em>framework thus accounts for the different institutional competencies of agencies and courts: Courts are expert at statutory construction, while agencies are expert at statutory implementation.  That the distinction can be subtle does not lessen its importance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 25 years since <em>Chevron</em> was decided, this Court has continued to recognize that courts and agencies play complementary roles in the project of statutory interpretation.  We have repeatedly held that \xe2\x80\x9cambiguities in statutes within an agency\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 980 (2005).  But even when confronted with a statute that involves a degree of ambiguity\xe2\x80\x94as most statutes do\xe2\x80\x94we have not abdicated our judicial role.  The fact that Congress has left a gap for the agency to fill means that courts should defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable gap-filling decisions, not that courts should cease to mark the bounds of delegated agency choice.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In cases involving agency adjudication, we have sometimes described the court\xe2\x80\x99s role as deciding pure questions of statutory construction and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s role as applying law to fact.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/421/index.html">480 U. S. 421</a>; <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Food &amp; Commercial Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/112/index.html">484 U. S. 112</a> (1987); see also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/677/index.html">541 U. S. 677</a>, 701\xe2\x80\x93702 (2004).  While this phrasing is peculiar to the adjudicatory context, the principle applies to <em>Chevron</em>\xe2\x80\x99s domain more broadly.  In the context of agency rulemaking, for instance, we might distinguish between pure questions of statutory interpretation and policymaking, or between central legal issues and interstitial questions.  See <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Walton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/212/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/212/index.html">535 U. S. 212</a>, 222 (2002).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The label is immaterial.  What matters is the principle: Certain aspects of statutory interpretation remain within the purview of the courts, even when the statute is not entirely clear, while others are properly understood as delegated by Congress to an expert and accountable administrative body.  Statutory language may thus admit of both judicial construction and agency exposition.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases construing the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et\xc2\xa0seq.</em>, illustrate the proper division of responsibility between courts and agencies and highlight when <em>Chevron </em>deference is appropriate and when it is not.  In <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>,<em> </em>the question was whether the standard of INA \xc2\xa7243(h), 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253(h) (1982 ed.), which requires an alien to show that she is more likely than not to be subject to persecution if she is deported, also governs applications for asylum under \xc2\xa7208(a), 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71158(a) (1982 ed.), which authorizes the Attorney General to grant asylum to an alien who has a well-founded fear of persecution in her home country.  After considering the INA\xe2\x80\x99s language, its legislative history, and the United Nations Protocol that Congress had implemented, the Court determined that the two standards are not the same.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so holding, we decisively rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention, echoed by Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in the judgment, that the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 (BIA) interpretation of the statute merited deference under our then-recent decision in <em>Chevron</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe question whether Congress intended the two standards to be identical is a pure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated.  480 U. S., at 446.  We therefore did not defer to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the two standards as equivalent but instead employed traditional tools of statutory construction and \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that Congress did not intend the two standards to be identical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Importantly, we recognized that <em>Chevron </em>deference need not be an all-or-nothing venture.  Even after the question of the standards\xe2\x80\x99 equivalency was resolved, there remained the question of their application.  We explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThe narrow legal question whether the two standards are the same is, of course, quite different from the question of interpretation that arises in each case in which the agency is required to apply either or both standards to a particular set of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 U. S., at 448.  And we noted that applying the INA was a task particularly suited to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s unique competencies:<font b="1"> \xe2\x80\x9cThere is obviously some ambiguity in a term like \xe2\x80\x98well-founded fear\xe2\x80\x99 which can only be given concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.  In that process of filling \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cany gap left, implicitly or explicitly by Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 the courts must respect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress has delegated the responsibility for administering the statutory program.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

S. 415</a> (1999), the Court encountered just the type of agency decision <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em> indicated would warrant <em>Chevron </em>deference.  The BIA had denied withholding of deportation because it found that the respondent had \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted a serious nonpolitical crime\xe2\x80\x9d before he entered the United States, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253(h)(2)(C) (1994 ed.).  The Court of Appeals reversed the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision and required it to supplement its balancing test with specific additional factors (such as whether the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s acts were grossly out of proportion to their objective and whether the acts were politically necessary and successful).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reversed the Court of Appeals, concluding that <em>Chevron </em>deference should be accorded to the BIA \xe2\x80\x9cas it gives ambiguous statutory terms \xe2\x80\x98concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U.

The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of a test to apply the statutory standard in individual cases and its application of that test in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case were precisely the sort of agency actions that merited judicial deference.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The threshold question the Court addresses today is the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cpure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide\xe2\x80\x9d that we answered in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 446, rather than a fact-intensive question of the kind we addressed in <em>Aguirre-Aguirre</em>.  Just as we decided the narrow legal question presented in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em> but did not \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to set forth a detailed description of how the \xe2\x80\x98well-founded fear\xe2\x80\x99 test should be applied,\xe2\x80\x9d 480 U. S., at 448, I would decide the narrow legal question now before us and remand for the agency to determine how the persecutor bar applies in individual cases.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For reasons similar to those set forth in my dissent in <em>Fedorenko</em>, I think it plain that the persecutor bar does not disqualify from asylum or withholding of removal an alien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product of duress.  Although I agree in full with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the majority opinion in <em>Fedorenko </em>does not govern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, the differences the Court highlights between the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009, and the Refugee Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 102, only strengthen my conclusion that <em>voluntary</em> assistance in persecution is required and that duress and coercion vitiate voluntariness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Fedorenko</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the DPA threatened to exclude from the United States concentration camp prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in the persecution of other prisoners.  In my view, this construction was insupportable\xe2\x80\x94the DPA\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of persons who \xe2\x80\x9cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations,\xe2\x80\x9d Constitution of the International Refugee Organization, Annex I, Part II, \xc2\xa72<em>(a)</em>, 62 Stat. 3051, did not extend to concentration camp prisoners who did so involuntarily.  These prisoners were victims, not persecutors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without an exception for involuntary action, the Refugee Act\xe2\x80\x99s bar would similarly treat entire classes of victims as persecutors.  The Act does not support such a reading.  The language of the persecutor bar is most naturally read to denote culpable conduct, and this reading is powerfully supported by the statutory context and legislative history.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this Court has previously recognized\xe2\x80\x94and as the majority acknowledges again today\xe2\x80\x94Congress passed the Refugee Act to implement the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951) (hereinafter Convention), reprinted in 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 6259, and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 6223, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (hereinafter Protocol).  These treaties place a mandatory obligation on signatory states not to \xe2\x80\x9cexpel or return (\xe2\x80\x98refouler\xe2\x80\x99) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to \xe2\x80\xa6 territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention, Art. 33(1), 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 6276; Protocol, Art.\xc2\xa0I, 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 6225.  The Refugee Act\xe2\x80\x99s withholding of removal provision specifically tracks this language.  8 U.

No. 96\xe2\x80\x93608, p.\xc2\xa018 (1979) (withholding of removal provision \xe2\x80\x9cclearly reflects our legal obligations under international agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically Convention Article 33).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Convention excludes from the <em>nonrefoulement </em>obligation of Article 33 persons who have \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention, Art.\xc2\xa01(F)<em>(a)</em>, 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 6263.  It is this exception that the persecutor bar reflects.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x93608, at 18 (persecutor bar encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions \xe2\x80\xa6 provided in the Convention relating to aliens who have themselves participated in persecution\xe2\x80\x9d); H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x93781, p.\xc2\xa020 (1980).  The language of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s exception is critical: We do not normally convict individuals of <em>crimes</em> when their actions are coerced or otherwise involuntary.  Indeed, the United Nations Handbook, to which the Court has looked for guidance in the past, states that all relevant factors, including \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d must be considered in determining whether an alien\xe2\x80\x99s acts are of a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal nature\xe2\x80\x9d as contemplated by Article 1(F).  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6157, 162 (reedited Jan. 1992).  Other states parties to the Convention and Protocol likewise read the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s exception as limited to culpable conduct.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  When we interpret treaties, we consider the interpretations of the courts of other nations, and we should do the same when Congress asks us to interpret a statute in light of a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s language.  See <em>Zicherman</em> v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/217/index.html">516 U. S. 217</a>, 226\xe2\x80\x93228 (1996).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to conform United States law to the standard set forth in the U. N. Convention and Protocol shows that it intended the persecutor bar to apply only to culpable, voluntary acts\xe2\x80\x94and it underscores that Congress did not delegate the question presented by this case to the agency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I would hold that the persecutor bar does not automatically disqualify from asylum or withholding of removal an alien who acted involuntarily,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] I would leave for the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94and, through his own delegation, the BIA\xe2\x80\x94the question how the voluntariness standard should be applied.  The agency would retain the ability, for instance, to define duress and coercion; to determine whether or not a balancing test should be employed; and, of course, to decide whether any individual asylum-seeker\xe2\x80\x99s acts were covered by the persecutor bar.  Those are the sorts of questions suited to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s unique competencies in administering the INA.  The threshold question before the Court is not.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I remain convinced that the narrower interpretation of<em> Chevron </em>endorsed by the Court in <em>Cardoza-Fonseca </em>was more faithful to the rationale of that case than the broader view the Court adopts today, I am unable to join its opinion.  I would answer the question of law that this case presents with an unequivocal \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d and remand to the agency for further proceedings.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Notably, the EPA cast its activity not as statutory construction but as public administration; its rulemaking sought to achieve policy goals, such as reducing regulatory complexity and promoting plant modernization.

To be sure, the EPA argued that its regulation defining \xe2\x80\x9cstationary source\xe2\x80\x9d as an entire plant was permissible under the Clean Air Act, but the agency treated its rulemaking as a matter of fashioning sound policy, not of discerning the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cstationary source\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

CAT, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\xe2\x80\x9320 (1988), 1465 U. N. T. S. 85; 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71208.16\xe2\x80\x931208.18 (2008).  The CAT prohibits a state party from returning any person to a country where there is substantial reason to believe he might be tortured, but its definition of torture covers a narrower class of harms, imposed by a narrower class of actors, than the asylum and witholding of removal provisions.  Most importantly, the CAT limits its definition of torture to acts \xe2\x80\x9cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d Pt. I, Art. 1, \xc2\xb61, p. 19, while asylum and withholding of removal are available to victims of harm inflicted by private actors, without regard to state involvement, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>In re Kasinga</em>, 21 I. &amp; N.
