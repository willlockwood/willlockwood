Section 117(a)(1) provides that any person who \xe2\x80\x9ccommits a domestic assault within .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The\n \nSixth Amendment guarantees indigent defendants appointed counsel in any state or federal criminal proceeding in which a term of imprisonment is imposed, <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n440 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367\n\xe2\x80\x93374, but it does not apply in tribal-court proceedings, see <i>Plains Commerce Bank</i> v. <i>Long Family Land &amp; Cattle Co.</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316\n.  The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA), which governs tribal-court proceedings, accords a range of procedural safeguards to tribal-court defendants \xe2\x80\x9csimilar, but not identical, to those contained in the Bill of Rights and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Santa Clara Pueblo</i> v. <i>Martinez</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n.  In particular, ICRA provides indigent defendants with a right to appointed counsel only for sentences exceeding one year.\n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71302(c)(2).  ICRA\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel therefore is not coextensive with the\n \nSixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">This Court has held that a conviction obtained in state or federal court in violation of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel cannot be used in a subsequent proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cto support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burgett</i> v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109\n.

When convicted, Bryant was indigent and was not appointed counsel.  For most of his convictions, he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment not exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x99s duration.  Because of his short prison terms, the prior tribal-court proceedings complied with ICRA, and his convictions were therefore valid when entered.  Based on domestic assaults he committed in 2011, Bryant was indicted on two counts of domestic assault by a habitual offender, in violation of \xc2\xa7117(a).  Represented in federal court by appointed counsel, he contended that the\n \nSixth Amendment precluded use of his prior, uncounseled, tribal-court misdemeanor convictions to satisfy \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predicate-offense element and moved to dismiss the indictment.  The District Court denied the motion; Bryant pleaded guilty, reserving the right to appeal.  The Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction and directed dismissal of the indictment.  It comprehended that Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s uncounseled tribal-court convictions were valid when entered because the\n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel does not apply in tribal-court proceedings.  It held, however, that Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s tribal-court convictions could not be used as predicate convictions within \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s compass because they would have violated the\n \nSixth Amendment had they been rendered in state or federal court.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s tribal-court convictions occurred in proceedings that complied with ICRA and were therefore valid when entered, use of those convictions as predicate offenses in a \xc2\xa7117(a) prosecution does not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Nichols</i> instructs that<i> </i>convictions valid when entered retain that status when invoked in a subsequent proceeding.  <i>Nichols </i>reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]nhancement statutes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, repeat-offender laws \xe2\x80\x9cpenaliz[e] only the last offense committed by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 747.  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence for violating \xc2\xa7117(a) punishes his most recent acts of domestic assault, not his prior crimes prosecuted in tribal court.  He was denied no right to counsel in tribal court, and his\n \nSixth Amendment right was honored in federal court.  Bryant acknowledges that <i>Nichols </i>would have allowed reliance on uncounseled tribal-court convictions resulting in fines to satisfy \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prior-crimes predicate.  But there is no cause to distinguish for \xc2\xa7117(a) purposes between fine-only tribal-court convictions and valid but uncounseled tribal-court convictions resulting in imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.  Neither violates the\n \nSixth Amendment.  Bryant is not aided by <i>Burgett.  </i>A defendant convicted in tribal court suffered no\n \nSixth Amendment violation in the first instance, so he cannot \xe2\x80\x9csuffe[r] anew\xe2\x80\x9d from a prior deprivation in his federal prosecution.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Bryant also invokes the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFifth Amendment to support his assertion that tribal-court judgments should not be used as predicate offenses under \xc2\xa7117(a).  ICRA, however, guarantees \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law,\xe2\x80\x9d accords other procedural safeguards, and permits a prisoner to challenge the fundamental fairness of tribal court proceedings in federal habeas corpus proceedings.  Because proceedings in compliance with ICRA sufficiently ensure the reliability of tribal-court convictions, the use of those convictions in a federal prosecution does not violate a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s due process right.

It is undisputed that a conviction obtained in violation of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel cannot be used in a subsequent proceeding \xe2\x80\x9ceither to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burgett</i> v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109,\n115 (1967)\n.  In <i>Burgett</i>, we held that an uncounseled felony conviction obtained in state court in violation of the right to counsel could not be used in a subsequent proceeding to prove the prior-felony element of a recidivist statute.  To permit such use of a constitutionally infirm conviction, we explained, would cause \xe2\x80\x9cthe accused in effect [to] suffe[r] anew from the [prior] deprivation of [his]\n \nSixth Amendment right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Tucker</i>,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 443,\n448 (1972)\n (invalid, uncounseled prior convictions could not be relied upon at sentencing to impose a longer term of imprisonment for a subsequent conviction); cf. <i>Loper</i> v. <i>Beto</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 473\n\xe2\x80\x93484 (1972) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cuse of convictions constitutionally invalid under <i>Gideon</i> v. <i>Wainwright</i> to impeach a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s credibility deprives him of due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d because the prior convictions \xe2\x80\x9clac[k] reliability\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> In <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 738 (1994)\n, we stated an important limitation on the principle recognized in <i>Burgett</i>.  In the case under review, Nichols pleaded guilty to a federal felony drug offense.  511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 740.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he had been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), a state-law misdemeanor, and fined $250 but not imprisoned.  <i>Ibid</i>.

During the period relevant to this case, Bryant, an enrolled member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, lived on that Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s reservation in Montana.  He has a record of over 100 tribal-court convictions, including several misdemeanor convictions for domestic assault.  Specifically, between 1997 and 2007, Bryant pleaded guilty on at least five occasions in Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court to committing domestic abuse in violation of the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Code.  On one occasion, Bryant hit his live-in girlfriend on the head with a beer bottle and attempted to strangle her.  On another, Bryant beat a different girlfriend, kneeing her in the face, breaking her nose, and leaving her bruised and bloodied.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For most of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s repeated brutal acts of domestic violence, the Tribal Court sentenced him to terms of imprisonment, never exceeding one year.  When convicted of these offenses, Bryant was indigent and was not appointed counsel.  Because of his short prison terms, Bryant acknowledges, the prior tribal-court proceedings complied with ICRA, and his convictions were therefore valid when entered.  Bryant has never challenged his tribal-court convictions in federal court under ICRA\xe2\x80\x99s habeas corpus provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2011, Bryant was arrested yet again for assaulting women.  In February of that year, Bryant attacked his then girlfriend, dragging her off the bed, pulling her hair, and repeatedly punching and kicking her.  During an interview with law enforcement officers, Bryant admitted that he had physically assaulted this woman five or six times.  Three months later, he assaulted another woman with whom he was then living, waking her by yelling that he could not find his truck keys and then choking her until she almost lost consciousness.  Bryant later stated that he had assaulted this victim on three separate occasions during the two months they dated.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on the 2011 assaults, a federal grand jury in Montana indicted Bryant on two counts of domestic assault by a habitual offender, in violation of \xc2\xa7117(a).  Bryant was represented in federal court by appointed counsel.  Contending that the\n \nSixth Amendment precluded use of his prior, uncounseled, tribal-court misdemeanor convictions to satisfy \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predicate-offense element, Bryant moved to dismiss the indictment.  The District Court denied the motion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, and Bryant entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal that decision.  Bryant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 46 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment on each count, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction and directed dismissal of the indictment.  769 F.\xc2\xa03d 671 (2014).  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s tribal-court convictions were not themselves constitutionally infirm, the Ninth Circuit comprehended, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nSixth Amendment right to appointed counsel does not apply in tribal court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 675.  But, the court continued, had the convictions been obtained in state or federal court, they would have violated the\n \nSixth Amendment because Bryant had received sentences of imprisonment although he lacked the aid of appointed counsel.  Adhering to its prior decision in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Ant</i>, 882 F.\xc2\xa02d 1389 (CA9 1989),[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>] the Court of Appeals held that, subject to narrow exceptions not relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9ctribal court convictions may be used in subsequent [federal] prosecutions only if the tribal court guarantees a right to counsel that is, at minimum, coextensive with the\n \nSixth Amendment right.\xe2\x80\x9d  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 677.  Rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that our decision in <i>Nichols </i>required the opposite result, the Ninth Circuit concluded that <i>Nichols </i>applies only when the prior conviction <i>did </i>comport with the\n \nSixth Amendment, <i>i.e., </i>when no sentence of imprisonment was imposed for the prior conviction.  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 677\xe2\x80\x93678.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Watford concurred, agreeing that <i>Ant </i>controlled the outcome of this case, but urging reexamination of <i>Ant </i>in light of <i>Nichols</i>.  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 679.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Nichols</i>, Judge Watford wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cundermines the notion that uncounseled convictions are, as a categorical matter, too unreliable to be used as a basis for imposing a prison sentence in a subsequent case.\xe2\x80\x9d  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 679<i>.</i>  The Court of Appeals declined to rehear the case en banc over vigorous dissents by Judges Owens and O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In disallowing the use of an uncounseled tribal-court conviction to establish a prior domestic violence conviction within \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s compass, the Ninth Circuit created a Circuit split.  The Eighth and Tenth Circuits have both held that tribal-court \xe2\x80\x9cconvictions, valid at their inception, and not alleged to be otherwise unreliable, may be used to prove the elements of \xc2\xa7117.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cavanaugh</i>, 643 F.\xc2\xa03d 592, 594 (CA8 2011); see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Shavanaux</i>, 647 F.\xc2\xa03d 993, 1000 (CA10 2011).

Brief for Respondent 5.  Those prior convictions complied with ICRA, he concedes, and therefore were valid when entered.  But, had his convictions occurred in state or federal court, Bryant observes, <i>Argersinger </i>and <i>Scott </i>would have rendered them invalid because he was sentenced to incarceration without representation by court-appointed counsel.  Essentially, Bryant urges us to treat tribal-court convictions, for \xc2\xa7117(a) purposes, as though they had been entered by a federal or state court.  We next explain why we decline to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As earlier recounted, we held in <i>Nichols </i>that \xe2\x80\x9can uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <i>Scott </i>because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 748\xe2\x80\x93749<i>.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cEnhancement statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d we reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, repeat-offender laws \xe2\x80\x9cpenaliz[e] only the last offense committed by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 747; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rodriquez</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377,\n386 (2008)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. 100% of the punishment is for the offense of conviction.

Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s 46-month sentence for violating \xc2\xa7117(a) punishes his most recent acts of domestic assault, not his prior crimes prosecuted in tribal court.  Bryant was denied no right to counsel in tribal court, and his\n \nSixth Amendment right was honored in federal court, when he was \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama</i> v. <i>Shelton</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 654,\n664 (2002)\n.  It would be \xe2\x80\x9codd to say that a conviction untainted by a violation of the\n \nSixth Amendment triggers a violation of that same amendment when it\xe2\x80\x99s used in a subsequent case where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to appointed counsel is fully respected.\xe2\x80\x9d  769 F. 3d, at 679 (Watford, J., concurring).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bryant acknowledges that had he been punished only by fines in his tribal-court proceedings, <i>Nichols </i>would have allowed reliance on his uncounseled convictions to satisfy \xc2\xa7117(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prior-crimes predicate.  Brief for Respondent 50.  We see no cause to distinguish for \xc2\xa7117(a) purposes between valid but uncounseled convictions resulting in a fine and valid but uncounseled convictions resulting in imprisonment not exceeding one year.  \xe2\x80\x9cBoth Nichols\xe2\x80\x99s and Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s uncounseled convictions \xe2\x80\x98comport\xe2\x80\x99 with the\n \nSixth Amendment, and for <i>the same reason</i>: the\n \nSixth Amendment right to appointed counsel did not apply to either conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a (O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In keeping with <i>Nichols</i>, we resist creating a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid\xe2\x80\x9d category of tribal-court convictions, \xe2\x80\x9cgood for the punishment actually imposed but not available for sentence enhancement in a later prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 744.  <i>Nichols </i>indicates that use of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s uncounseled tribal-court convictions in his \xc2\xa7117(a) prosecution did not \xe2\x80\x9ctransform his prior, valid, tribal court convictions into new, invalid, federal ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J.).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision in <i>Burgett</i>, which<i> </i>prohibited the subsequent use of a conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel, does not aid Bryant.

Because a defendant convicted in tribal court suffers no\n \nSixth Amendment violation in the first instance, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]se of tribal convictions in a subsequent prosecution cannot violate [the\n \nSixth Amendment] \xe2\x80\x98anew.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shavanaux</i>, 647 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 998.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bryant observes that reliability concerns underlie our right-to-counsel decisions and urges that those concerns remain even if the\n \nSixth Amendment itself does not shelter him.  <i>Scott </i>and <i>Nichols</i>, however, counter the argument that uncounseled misdemeanor convictions are categorically unreliable, either in their own right or for use in a subsequent proceeding.  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that a tribal-court conviction resulting in a fine would qualify as a \xc2\xa7117(a) predicate offense, we further note, diminishes the force of his reliability-based argument.  There is no reason to suppose that tribal-court proceedings are less reliable when a sentence of a year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment is imposed than when the punishment is merely a fine.  No evidentiary or procedural variation turns on the sanction\xe2\x80\x94fine only or a year in prison\xe2\x80\x94ultimately imposed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bryant also invokes the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFifth Amendment in support of his assertion that tribal-court judgments should not be used as predicate offenses.  But, as earlier observed, ICRA itself requires tribes to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71302(a)(8), and it accords defendants specific procedural safeguards resembling those contained in the Bill of Rights and the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8.  Further, ICRA makes habeas review in federal court available to persons incarcerated pursuant to a tribal-court judgment.  \xc2\xa71303.  By that means, a prisoner may challenge the fundamental fairness of the proceedings in tribal court.  Proceedings in compliance with ICRA, Congress determined, and we agree, sufficiently ensure the reliability of tribal-court convictions.  Therefore, the use of those convictions in a federal prosecution does not violate a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process.  See <i>Shavanaux</i>, 647 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1000; cf. <i>State </i>v. <i>Spotted Eagle</i>, 316 Mont. 370, 378\xe2\x80\x93379, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d 1239, 1245\xe2\x80\x931246 (2003) (principles of comity support recognizing uncounseled tribal-court convictions that complied with ICRA).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s tribal-court convictions occurred in proceedings that complied with ICRA and were therefore valid when entered, use of those convictions as predicate offenses in a \xc2\xa7117(a) prosecution does not violate the Constitution.

Indian tribal court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d for domestic assault and similar crimes).  Because our precedents dictate that holding, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The fact that this case arose at all, however, illustrates how far afield our\n \nSixth Amendment and Indian-law precedents have gone.  Three basic assumptions underlie this case: that the\n \nSixth Amendment ordinarily bars the Government from introducing, in a later proceeding, convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, <i>ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939; that tribes\xe2\x80\x99 retained sovereignty entitles them to prosecute tribal members in proceedings that are not subject to the Constitution, <i>ante,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938; and that Congress can punish assaults that tribal members commit against each other on Indian land, <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  Although our precedents have endorsed these assumptions for decades, the Court has never identified a sound constitutional basis for any of them, and I see none.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with the notion that the\n \nSixth Amendment generally prohibits the government from using a prior, uncounseled conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel as a predicate for a new offense in a new proceeding.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  All that the text of the\n \nSixth Amendment requires in a criminal prosecution is that the accused enjoy the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ssistance of [c]ounsel\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>that</i> proceeding.  The Court was likely wrong in <i>Burgett </i>v. <i>Texas, </i>\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109 (1967)\n, when it created a\n \nSixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cexclusionary rule\xe2\x80\x9d that prohibits the government from using prior convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel in subsequent proceedings to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cerod[ing] the principle\xe2\x80\x9d of the right to counsel.  <i>Id.,</i> at 115.  I would be open to reconsidering <i>Burgett </i>in a future case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The remaining two assumptions underpinning this case exemplify a central tension within our Indian-law jurisprudence.  On the one hand, the only reason why tribal courts had the power to convict Bryant in proceedings where he had no right to counsel is that such prosecutions are a function of a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s core sovereignty.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lara</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193,\n197 (2004)\n; <i>United</i> <i>States</i> v. <i>Wheeler</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 313\n\xe2\x80\x93323 (1978).  By virtue of tribes\xe2\x80\x99 status as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98separate sovereigns pre-existing the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d tribal prosecutions need not, under our precedents, comply with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98those constitutional provisions framed specifically as limitations on federal or state authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (quoting <i>Santa Clara Pueblo</i> v. <i>Martinez</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49,\n56 (1978)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the other hand, the validity of Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing federal conviction rests upon a contrary view of tribal sovereignty.  Congress ordinarily lacks authority to enact a general federal criminal law proscribing domestic abuse.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\n\xe2\x80\x93613 (2000).  But, the Court suggests, Congress must intervene on reservations to ensure that prolific domestic abusers receive sufficient punishment.  See <i>ante</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The Court does not explain where Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to act comes from, but our precedents leave no doubt on this score.  Congress could make Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s domestic assaults a federal crime subject to federal prosecution only because our precedents have endowed Congress with an \xe2\x80\x9call-encompassing\xe2\x80\x9d power over all aspects of tribal sovereignty.  <i>Wheeler</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 319.  Thus, even though tribal prosecutions of tribal members are purportedly the apex of tribal sovereignty, Congress can second-guess how tribes prosecute domestic abuse perpetrated by Indians against other Indians on Indian land by virtue of its \xe2\x80\x9cplenary power\xe2\x80\x9d over Indian tribes.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kagama</i>,\n\n118 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375\n\xe2\x80\x93384 (1886); accord, <i>Lara, </i>541 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 200.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I continue to doubt whether either view of tribal sovereignty is correct.  See <i>id.,</i> at 215 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Indian tribes have varied origins, discrete treaties with the United States, and different patterns of assimilation and conquest.  In light of the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 distinct histories, it strains credulity to assume that all tribes necessarily retained the sovereign prerogative of prosecuting their own members.  And by treating all tribes as possessing an identical quantum of sovereignty, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have made it all but impossible to understand the ultimate source of each tribe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and whether it endures.  See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 1070\xe2\x80\x931074, 1107\xe2\x80\x931110 (2004).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purported plenary power over Indian tribes rests on even shakier foundations.  No enumerated power\xe2\x80\x94not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with In-dian Tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d not the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s role in approving treaties, nor anything else\xe2\x80\x94gives Congress such sweeping authority.  See <i>Lara, supra</i>, at 224\xe2\x80\x93225 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); <i>Adoptive Couple</i> v. <i>Baby Girl</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x935).<b> </b>Indeed, the Court created this new power because it was unable to find an enumerated power justifying the federal Major Crimes Act, which for the first time punished crimes committed by Indians against Indians on Indian land.  See <i>Kagama</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 377\xe2\x80\x93380; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 5.  The Court asserted: \xe2\x80\x9cThe power of the General Government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  It must exist in that government, because it has never existed anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kagama,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 384.  Over a century later, <i>Kagama </i>endures as the foundation of this doctrine, and the Court has searched in vain for any valid constitutional justification for this unfettered power.  See, <i>e.g., Lone Wolf</i> v. <i>Hitchcock</i>,\n\n187 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553\n\xe2\x80\x93567 (1903) (relying on <i>Kagama\xe2\x80\x99s</i> race-based plenary power theory); <i>Winton</i> v. <i>Amos</i>,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373\n\xe2\x80\x93392 (1921) (Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cplenary authority\xe2\x80\x9d is based on Indians\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccondition of tutelage or dependency\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Wheeler</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 319 (<i>Winton</i> and <i>Lone Wolf</i> illustrate the \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed fact that Congress has plenary authority\xe2\x80\x9d over tribes); <i>Lara, supra,</i> at 224 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court utterly fails to find any provision of the Constitution that gives Congress enumerated power to alter tribal sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is time that the Court reconsider these precedents.  Until the Court ceases treating all Indian tribes as an undifferentiated mass, our case law will remain bedeviled by amorphous and ahistorical assumptions about the scope of tribal sovereignty.  And, until the Court rejects the fiction that Congress possesses plenary power over Indian affairs, our precedents will continue to be based on the paternalistic theory that Congress must assume all-encompassing control over the \xe2\x80\x9cremnants of a race\xe2\x80\x9d for its own good.  <i>Kagama,</i> <i>supra,</i> at 384.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
