Was she entitled to any compensation? 2d. Had she received a compensation? As to the first, it was RULED, that if the services were rendered merely in expectation of a legacy, without any contract, express or implied, but relying, implicitly, on the testator\'s generosity, the action could not be maintained. The weight of the evidence, however, is that he promised to take care of her, though he did not say how; that at one time he offered to marry her; and, at another time, he said that he would provide for her as a child. As to the second question, it is merely a matter of fact, on which the jury must decide. </p><p> For the Plaintiff, Rawle. </p><p> For the Defendant, Sergeant and Roberts, who cited 1 Vern. 98. 2 Atk. 251. 409. 2 Stra 728. 1 Dall. 265. 1 Bar. 157.
