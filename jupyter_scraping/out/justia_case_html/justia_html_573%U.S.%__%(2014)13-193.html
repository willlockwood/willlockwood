Anthony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false statements made during the course of a political campaign.  Specifically, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a vote in favor of \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer funded abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  After Driehaus lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA continued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging the law on\n \nFirst Amendment grounds.  Petitioner Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a\n \nFirst Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained due to the proceedings against SBA.  The District Court consolidated the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article III purposes.

When challenging a law prior to its enforcement, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges \xe2\x80\x9can intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Babbitt v.

Golden v. Zwickler,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n, is distinguishable; the threat of prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly conjectural because the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csole concern\xe2\x80\x9d related to a former Congressman who was unlikely to run for office again.  Here, by contrast, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate.  Nor does SBA\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that its previous statements were true render its fears of enforcement misplaced.  After all, that insistence did not prevent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the first time.

There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners.  Past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98chimerical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Steffel v. Thompson,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n.  The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a complaint may be filed with the State Commission by \xe2\x80\x9cany person,\xe2\x80\x9d Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern because of the burden they impose on electoral speech.  Moreover, the target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days before an election.  But this Court need not decide whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is sufficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution.

The question in this caseis whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is justiciable\xe2\x80\x94and in particular, whether they have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of Article III.  We conclude that they have.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The Ohio statute at issue prohibits certain \xe2\x80\x9cfalse statement[s]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cduring the course of any campaign for nomination or election to public office or office of a political party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73517.21(B) (Lexis 2013).  As relevant here, the statute makes it a crime for any person to \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ake a false statement concerning the voting record of a candidate or public official,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73517.21(B)(9), or to \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ost, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise disseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73517.21(B)(10).[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n            \n        \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny person\xe2\x80\x9d acting on personal knowledge may file a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission (or Commission) alleging a violation of the false statement statute.  \xc2\xa73517.153(A) (Lexis Supp. 2014).  If filed within 60 days of a primary election or 90 days of a general election, the complaint is referred to a panel of at least three Commission members.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517.156(A), (B)(1) (Lexis 2013).  The panel must then hold an expedited hearing, generally within two business days, \xc2\xa73517.156(B)(1), to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the alleged violation occurred, \xc2\xa73517.156(C).  Upon a finding of probable cause, the full Commission must, within 10 days, hold a hearing on the complaint.  \xc2\xa73517.156(C)(2); see also Ohio Admin. Code \xc2\xa73517\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9310(E) (2008).</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The statute authorizes the full Commission to subpoena witnesses and compel production of documents.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73517.153(B) (Lexis Supp. 2014).  At the full hearing, the parties may make opening and closing statements and present evidence.  Ohio Admin. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9311(B)(2)(c), (d), (g).  If the Commission determines by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that a party has violated the false statement law, the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d refer the matter to the relevant county prosecutor.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517.155(D)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (Lexis Supp. 2014).  Alternatively, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s regulations state that it may simply issue a reprimand.  See Ohio Admin. Code \xc2\xa73517\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9314(D).  Violation of the false statement statute is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to six months of imprisonment, a fine up to $5,000, or both.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599.40 (Lexis 2013), 3517.992(V) (Lexis Supp. 2014).  A second conviction under the false statement statute is a fourth-degree felony that carries a mandatory penalty of disfranchisement.  \xc2\xa73599.39.</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Petitioner Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) is a \xe2\x80\x9cpro-life advocacy organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  525 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (CA6 2013).  During the 2010 election cycle, SBA publicly criticized various Members of Congress who voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  In particular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to \xe2\x80\x9ceducat[e] voters that their representative voted for a health care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  The press release listed then-Congressman Steve Driehaus, a respondent here, who voted for the ACA.  SBA also sought to display a billboard in Driehaus\xe2\x80\x99 district condemning that vote.  The planned billboard would have read: \xe2\x80\x9cShame on Steve Driehaus!  Driehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 37.  The advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to display that message, however, after Driehaus\xe2\x80\x99 counsel threatened legal action.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that SBA had violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely stating that he had voted for \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  Because Driehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the general election, a Commission panel held an expedited hearing.  On October 14, 2010, the panel voted 2 to 1 to find probable cause that a violation had been committed.  The full Commission set a hearing date for 10 business days later, and the parties commenced discovery.  Driehaus noticed depositions of three SBA employees as well as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups.  He also issued discovery requests for all evidence that SBA would rely on at the Commission hearing, as well as SBA\xe2\x80\x99s communications with allied organizations, political party committees, and Members of Congress and their staffs.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        On October 18, 2010\xe2\x80\x94after the panel\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination, but before the scheduled Commission hearing\xe2\x80\x94SBA filed suit in Federal District Court, seek-ing declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517.21(B)(9) and (10) violate the First and\n \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  The District Court stayed the action under Younger v. Harris,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37 (1971)\n, pending completion of the Commission proceedings.  The Sixth Circuit denied SBA\xe2\x80\x99s motion for an injunction pending appeal.  Driehaus and SBA eventually agreed to postpone the full Commission hearing until after the election.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he moved to withdraw his complaint against SBA.  The Commission granted the motion with SBA\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Once the Commission proceedings were terminated, the District Court lifted the stay and SBA amended its complaint.  As relevant here, the amended complaint alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitutional both facially and as applied.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that SBA\xe2\x80\x99s speech about Driehaus had been chilled; that SBA \xe2\x80\x9cintends to engage in substantially similar activity in the future\xe2\x80\x9d; and that it \xe2\x80\x9cface[d] the prospect of its speech and associational rights again being chilled and burdened,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny complainant can hale [it] before the [Commission], forcing it to expend time and resources defending itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 121\xe2\x80\x93122.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The District Court consolidated SBA\xe2\x80\x99s suit with a separate suit brought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Ad-ditional Spending and Taxes (COAST), an advocacy orga-nization that also alleged that the same Ohio falsestatement provisions are unconstitutional both facially and as applied.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  According to its amended complaint, COAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and other materials criticizing Driehaus\xe2\x80\x99 vote for the ACA as a vote \xe2\x80\x9cto fund abortions with tax dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d but refrained from doing so because of the Commission proceedings against SBA.  Id., at 146, 148, 162.  COAST further alleged that it \xe2\x80\x9cdesires to make the same or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for\xe2\x80\x9d the ACA, but that fear \xe2\x80\x9cof finding itself subject to the same fate\xe2\x80\x9d as SBA has deterred it from doing so.  Id., at 149, 157.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The District Court dismissed both suits as non-justiciable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.  525 Fed. Appx. 415.  The Court of Appeals analyzed three factors to assess whether the case was ripe for review: (1) the likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass; (2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed; and (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were denied.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded that SBA\xe2\x80\x99s prior injuries\xe2\x80\x94the probable-cause determination and the billboard rejection\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo not help it show an imminent threat of future prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commission never found that SBA . . . violated Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s false-statement law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 420.  The court further reasoned that it was speculative whether any person would file a complaint with the Commission in the future, in part because Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace Corps in Africa after losing the election.  Finally, the court noted that SBA has not alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cit plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech\xe2\x80\x9d in the future, but rather maintains that the statements it intends to make are factually true.  Id., at 422.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that the factual record was insufficiently developed with respect to the content of SBA\xe2\x80\x99s future speech, and that withholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship because, in the time period leading up to the 2010 election, SBA continued to communicate its message even after Commission proceedings were initiated.  The Sixth Circuit therefore determined that SBA\xe2\x80\x99s suit was not ripe for review, and that its analysis as to SBA compelled the same conclusion with respect to COAST.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        We granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now reverse.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S.

Amnesty Int\xe2\x80\x99l USA, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, (2013) (slip op., at 9).  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) an \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) a sufficient \xe2\x80\x9ccausal connection between the injuryand the conduct complained of,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) a \xe2\x80\x9clikel[ihood]\xe2\x80\x9d that the injury \xe2\x80\x9cwill be redressed by a favorable decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lujan, supra, at 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (internal quotation marksomitted).</p>\n<p>\n            \n        This case concerns the injury-in-fact requirement, which helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490, 498 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).  An injury sufficient to satisfy Article III must be \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent, not \xe2\x80\x98conjectural\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lujan, supra, at 560 (some internal question marks omitted).

When an individual is subject to such a threat, an actual arrest, prosecution, or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.  See Steffel v. Thompson,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,\n459 (1974)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d); see also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118\n\xe2\x80\x93129 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here threatened action by government is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, we have permitted pre-enforcement review under circumstances that render the threatened enforcement sufficiently imminent.  Specifically, we have held that a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges \xe2\x80\x9can intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Babbitt v. Farm Workers,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289,\n298 (1979)\n.  Several of our cases illustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs may bring a preenforcement challenge consistent with Article III.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        In Steffel, for example, police officers threatened to arrest petitioner and his companion for distributing handbills protesting the Vietnam War.  Petitioner left to avoid arrest; his companion remained and was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.  Petitioner sought a declaratory judgment that the trespass statute was unconstitutional as applied to him.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        We determined that petitioner had alleged a credible threat of enforcement:  He had been warned to stop handbilling and threatened with prosecution if he disobeyed; he stated his desire to continue handbilling (an activity he claimed was constitutionally protected); and his companion\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution showed that his \xe2\x80\x9cconcern with arrest\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0chimerical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 459.  Under those circumstances, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        In Babbitt, we considered a preenforcement challenge to a statute that made it an unfair labor practice to encourage consumers to boycott an \xe2\x80\x9cagricultural product .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301.  The plaintiffs contended that the law \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionally penalize[d] inaccuracies inadvertently uttered in the course of consumer appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Building on Steffel, we explained that a plaintiff could bring a preenforcement suit when he \xe2\x80\x9chas alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably af-fected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Babbit, supra, at 298.  We found those circumstances present in Babbitt.  In that case, the law \xe2\x80\x9con its face proscribe[d] dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 302.  The plaintiffs had \xe2\x80\x9cactively engaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past\xe2\x80\x9d and alleged \xe2\x80\x9can intention to continue\xe2\x80\x9d those campaigns in the future.  Id., at 301.  And although they did not \xe2\x80\x9cplan to propagate untruths,\xe2\x80\x9d they argued that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We concluded that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 fear of prosecution was not \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary or wholly speculative,\xe2\x80\x9d and that their challenge to the consumer publicity provision presented an Article III case or controversy.  Id., at 302.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Two other cases bear mention.  In Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn. Inc.,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383 (1988)\n, we held that booksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law making it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowingly display for commercial purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d material that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98harmful to juveniles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the statute.  Id., at 386.  At trial, the booksellers introduced 16 books they believed were covered by the statute and testified that costly compliance measures would be necessary to avoid prosecution for displaying such books.  Just as in Babbitt and Steffel, we determined that the \xe2\x80\x9cpre-enforcement nature\xe2\x80\x9d of the suit was not \xe2\x80\x9ctroubl[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d because the plaintiffs had \xe2\x80\x9calleged an actual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them.\xe2\x80\x9d  484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Finally, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2010)\n, we considered a preenforcement challenge to a law that criminalized \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0knowingly provid[ing] mate-rial support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 8.  The plaintiffs claimed that they had provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations prior to the law\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and would provide similar support in the future.  The Government had charged 150 persons with violating the law and declined to disavow prosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support of the designated organizations.  We held that the claims were justiciable: The plaintiffs faced a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98credible threat\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of enforcement and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 15.</p>\n<p>IV</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Here, SBA and COAST contend that the threat of enforcement of the false statement statute amounts to an Article III injury in fact.  We agree: Petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement.  See Babbitt, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 298.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>\n            \n        First, petitioners have alleged \xe2\x80\x9can intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Both petitioners have pleaded specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.  SBA has already stated that representatives who voted for the ACA supported \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer-funded abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d and it has alleged an \xe2\x80\x9cinten[t] to engage in substantially similar activity in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 49\xe2\x80\x9350, 122.  See also Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (observing that plaintiffs had previously provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations and alleged they \xe2\x80\x9cwould provide similar support [to the same terrorist organizations] again if the statute\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted\xe2\x80\x9d).  COAST has alleged that it previously intended to disseminate materials criticizing a vote for the ACA as a vote \xe2\x80\x9cto fund abortions with tax dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it \xe2\x80\x9cdesires to make the same or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for [the ACA].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 146, 149, 162.  Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 intended future conduct concerns political speech, it is certainly \xe2\x80\x9caffected with a constitutional interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Babbitt, supra, at 298; see also Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,\n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 265,\n272 (1971)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Next, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 intended future conduct is \xe2\x80\x9carguably.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. proscribed by [the] statute\xe2\x80\x9d they wish to challenge.  Babbitt, supra, at 298.  The Ohio false statement law sweeps broadly, see supra, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and n.\xc2\xa01., and covers the subject matter of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 intended speech.  Both SBA and COAST have alleged an intent to \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ake\xe2\x80\x9d statements \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning the voting record of a candidate or public official,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73517.21(B)(9), and to \xe2\x80\x9cdisseminate\xe2\x80\x9d statements \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning a candidate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to promote the election, nomination, or defeat of the candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73517.21(B)(10).  And, a Commission panel here already found probable cause to believe that SBA violated the statute when it stated that Driehaus had supported\xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer-funded abortion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the same sort of statement petitioners plan to disseminate in the future.  Under these circumstances, we have no difficulty concluding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 intended speech is \xe2\x80\x9carguably proscribed\xe2\x80\x9d by the law.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Respondents incorrectly rely on Golden v. Zwickler,\n\n394 U. S. 103 (1969)\n.  In that case, the plaintiff had previously distributed anonymous leaflets criticizing a particular Congressman who had since left office.  Id., at 104\xe2\x80\x93106, and n.\xc2\xa02.  The Court dismissed the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the electoral leafletting ban as nonjusticiable because his \xe2\x80\x9csole concern was literature relating to the Congressman and his record,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit was most unlikely that the Congressman would again be a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 109 (emphasis added).  Under those circumstances, any threat of future prosecution was \xe2\x80\x9cwholly conjectural.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Here, by contrast, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate.  See Reply Brief 4\xe2\x80\x935 (identifying other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as potential objects of SBA\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms).  Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged future speech is not directed exclusively at Driehaus, it does not matter whether he \xe2\x80\x9cmay run for office again.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 33 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As long as petitioners continue to engage in comparable electoral speech regarding support for the ACA, that speech will remain arguably proscribed by Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s false statement statute.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that SBA\xe2\x80\x99s fears of enforcement are misplaced because SBA has not said it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 15 (quoting 525 Fed. Appx., at 422).  The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA \xe2\x80\x9ccan only be liable for making a statement \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 it is false,\xe2\x80\x9d SBA\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that its speech is factually true \xe2\x80\x9cmakes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such statements exceedingly slim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 422.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The Sixth Circuit misses the point.  SBA\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that the allegations in its press release were true did not prevent the Commission panel from finding probable cause to believe that SBA had violated the law the first time around.  And, there is every reason to think that similar speech in the future will result in similar proceedings, notwithstanding SBA\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the truth of its allegations.  Nothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions requires a plaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a law to confess that he will in fact violate that law.  See, e.g., Babbitt, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 301 (case was justiciable even though plaintiffs disavowed any intent to \xe2\x80\x9cpropagate untruths\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Finally, the threat of future enforcement of the false statement statute is substantial.  Most obviously, there is a history of past enforcement here: SBA was the subject of a complaint in a recent election cycle.  We have observed that past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0chimerical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Steffel, 415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 459; cf. Clapper, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 theory of standing was \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially undermine[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by their \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] to offer any evidence that their communications ha[d] been monitored\xe2\x80\x9d under the challenged statute).  Here, the threat is even more substantial given that the Commission panel actually found probable cause to believe that SBA\xe2\x80\x99s speech violated the false statement statute.  Indeed future complainants may well \xe2\x80\x9cinvoke the prior probable-cause finding to prove that SBA knowingly lied.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 32.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that authority to file a complaint with the Commission is not limited to a prosecutor or an agency.  Instead, the false statement statute allows \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d with knowledge of the purported violation to file a complaint. \xc2\xa73517.153(A).  Because the universe of potential complainants is not restricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit guidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of complaints from, for example, political opponents.  See Brief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as Amicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also id., at 6 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commission has no system for weeding out frivolous complaints\xe2\x80\x9d).  And petitioners, who intend to criticize candidates for political office, are easy targets.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Finally, Commission proceedings are not a rare occurrence.  Petitioners inform us that the Commission \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98handles about 20 to 80 false statement complaints per year,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 46, and respondents do not deny that the Commission frequently fields complaints alleging violations of the false statement statute.  Cf. Humani-tarian Law Project, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16 (noting that there had been numerous prior prosecutions under the challenged statute).  Moreover, respondents have not disavowed enforcement if petitioners make similar statements in the future.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330; see also Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government has not argued to this Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what they say they wish to do\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, the specter of enforcement is so substantial that the owner of the billboard refused to display SBA\xe2\x80\x99s message after receiving a letter threatening Commission proceedings.  On these facts, the prospect of future enforcement is far from \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary or speculative.\xe2\x80\x9d  Babbitt, supra, at 298.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        We take the threatened Commission proceedings into account because administrative action, like arrest or prosecution, may give rise to harm sufficient to justify pre-enforcement review.  See Ohio Civil Rights Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc.,\n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619\n\xe2\x80\x93626, n.\xc2\xa01 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a reasonable threat of prosecution creates a ripe controversy, we fail to see how the actual filing of the administrative action threatening sanctions in this case does not\xe2\x80\x9d).  The burdens that Commission proceedings can impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here.  As the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of the Ohio false statement scheme is \xe2\x80\x9cto permit a private complainant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to gain a campaign advantage without ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.\xe2\x80\x9d  DeWine Brief 7.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]omplainants may time their submissions to achieve maximum disruption of their political opponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on the merits will be deferred until after the relevant election.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Moreover, the target of a false statement complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days leading up to an election.  And where, as here, a Commission panel issues a preelection probable-cause finding, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a determination itself may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 13.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Although the threat of Commission proceedings is a substantial one, we need not decide whether that threat standing alone gives rise to an Article III injury.  The burdensome Commission proceedings here are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution.  We conclude that the combination of those two threats suffices to create an Article III injury under the circumstances of this case.  See Babbitt, supra, at 302, n.\xc2\xa013 (In addition to the threat of criminal sanctions, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prospect of issuance of an administrative cease-and-desist order or a court-ordered injunction against such prohibited conduct provides substantial additional support for the conclusion that appellees\xe2\x80\x99 challenge .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is justiciable\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n            \n        That conclusion holds true as to both SBA and COAST.  Respondents, relying on Younger v. Harris,\n\n401 U. S. 37 (1971)\n, appear to suggest that COAST lacks standing because it refrained from actually disseminating its planned speech in order to avoid Commission proceedings of its own.  See Brief for Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 34.  In Younger, the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing leaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.  When he challenged the constitutionality of the law in federal court, several other plaintiffs intervened, arguing that their own speech was inhibited by Harris\xe2\x80\x99 prosecution.  The Court concluded that only the plaintiff had standing because the intervenors \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not claim that they ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution, that a prosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s remotely possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 42.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        That is not this case.  Unlike the intervenors in Younger, COAST has alleged an intent to engage in the same speech that was the subject of a prior enforcement proceeding.  Also unlike the intervenors in Younger, who had never been threatened with prosecution, COAST has been the subject of Commission proceedings in the past.  See, e.g., COAST Candidates PAC v. Ohio Elections Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, 543 Fed. Appx. 490 (CA6 2013).  COAST is far more akin to the plaintiff in Steffel, who was not arrested alongside his handbilling companion but was nevertheless threatened with prosecution for similar speech.  415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 459.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        In sum, we find that both SBA and COAST have alleged a credible threat of enforcement.</p>\n<p>V</p>\n<p>\n            \n        In concluding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not justiciable, the Sixth Circuit separately considered two other factors: whether the factual record was sufficiently developed, and whether hardship to the parties would result if judicial relief is denied at this stage in the proceedings.  525 Fed. Appx., at 419.  Respondents contend that these \xe2\x80\x9cprudential ripeness\xe2\x80\x9d factors confirm that the claims at issue are nonjusticiable.  Brief for Respondents 17.  But we have already concluded that petitioners have alleged a sufficient Article III injury.  To the extent respondents would have us deem petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims nonjusticiable \xe2\x80\x9con grounds that are \xe2\x80\x98prudential,\xe2\x80\x99 rather than constitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat request is in some tension with our recent reaffirmation of the principle that \xe2\x80\x98a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to hear and decide\xe2\x80\x99 cases within its jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x98is virtually unflagging.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lexmark Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc. v.

Jacobs, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6); some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n            \n        In any event, we need not resolve the continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case because the \xe2\x80\x9cfitness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chardship\xe2\x80\x9d factors are easily satisfied here.  First, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the Ohio false statement statute presents an issue that is \xe2\x80\x9cpurely legal, and will not be clarified by further factual development.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 568,\n581 (1985)\n.  And denying prompt judicial review would impose a substantial hardship on petitioners, forcing them to choose between refraining from core political speech on the one hand, or engaging in that speech and risking costly Commission proceedings and criminal prosecution on the other.</p>\n<p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Petitioners in this case have demonstrated an injury in fact sufficient for Article III standing.
