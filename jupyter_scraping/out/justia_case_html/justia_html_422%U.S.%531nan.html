JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Four months before this Court\'s decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html">413 U. S. 266</a></span> (1973), respondent was stopped in his automobile by a roving border patrol, and three plastic garbage bags containing 270 pounds of marihuana were found in the trunk of his car by Border Patrol agents.  On the basis of this evidence, an indictment was returned charging him with a violation of 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(a)(1).  When respondent\'s motion to suppress the evidence was denied after a hearing, he stipulated in writing that he</p>\n<p>"did knowingly and intentionally possess, with intent to distribute, the marijuana concealed in the 1962 Chevrolet which he was driving on February 28, 1973. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>The District Court found respondent guilty and imposed sentence.  On appeal from that judgment, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the judgment on the ground that the</p>\n<p>"rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States</em> . . . should be applied to similar cases pending on appeal on the date the Supreme Court\'s decision was announced."</p>\n<p>500 F.2d 985, 986 (1974) (footnote omitted). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We granted the Government\'s petition for certiorari.  419 U.S. 993 (1974).</p>\n<p>In <em>Almeida-Sanchez, supra,</em> this Court held that a warrantless automobile search, conducted approximately 25 air miles from the Mexican border by Border Patrol agents, acting without probable cause, was unconstitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 422 U. S. 533</a></p><p> under the Fourth Amendment. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In this case, the Government conceded in the Court of Appeals that the search of respondent\'s automobile approximately 70 air miles from the Mexican border and the seizure of the marihuana were unconstitutional under the standard announced in <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> but it contended that that standard should not be applied to searches conducted prior to June 21, 1973, the date of the decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em>  In an inquiry preliminary to balancing the interests for and against retroactive application, <em>see Stovall v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html">388 U. S. 293</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html#297">388 U. S. 297</a></span> (1967), the majority of the Court of Appeals first considered whether this Court had "articulated a new doctrine" in <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> 500 F.2d at 987.  <em>See, e.g., Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html">404 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#106">404 U. S. 106</a></span> (1971); <em>Milton v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/371/case.html">407 U. S. 371</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/371/case.html#381">407 U. S. 381</a></span>-382, n. 2 (1972) (STEWART, J., dissenting).  Concluding that <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> overruled no prior decision of this Court, and instead "reaffirmed well established Fourth Amendment standards" that did not "disturb a long-accepted and relied-upon practice," 500 F.2d at 988, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<p>"[Respondent] is entitled to the benefit of the rule announced in <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> not because of retroactivity, but because of Fourth Amendment principles never deviated from by the Supreme Court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 989.  The judgment of conviction was reversed, and the case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 422 U. S. 534</a></p><p> was remanded to the District Court to suppress the evidence seized from respondent\'s automobile.</p>\n<p>Although expressing some doubt about the applicability of the old law-new law test as a precondition to retroactivity analysis, <em>id.</em> at 990, the six dissenters joined issue with the majority over the proper interpretation of <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em>  The dissenters concluded that <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> had announced a new constitutional rule because the decision overruled a consistent line of Courts of Appeals precedent and disrupted a long-accepted and widely relied upon administrative practice.  Border Patrol agents had conducted roving searches pursuant to congressional authorization, 66 Stat. 233, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a)(3), and administrative regulation, 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 287.1(a)(2) (1973), which had been continuously upheld until this Court\'s decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em>  Since <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> stated a new rule, the dissenters concluded that the applicability of that decision to pre-June 21, 1973, roving patrol vehicle searches should be determined by reference to the standards summarized in <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  For the reasons expressed in Part II of Judge Wallace\'s opinion in <em>United States v. Bowen,</em> 500 F.2d 960, 975-981 (CA9), <em>cert. granted,</em> 419 U.S. 824 (1974), the dissenters concluded that <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> should be accorded prospective application.</p>\n<p>Despite the conceded illegality of the search under the <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> standard, the Government contends that the exclusionary rule should not be mechanically applied in the case now before us because the policies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 422 U. S. 535</a></p><p> underlying the rule do not justify its retroactive application to pre-<em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> searches.  We agree.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Since 1965, this Court has repeatedly struggled with the question of whether rulings in criminal cases should be given retroactive effect.  In those cases</p>\n<p>"[w]here the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truthfinding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials,"</p>\n<p><em>Williams v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html">401 U. S. 646</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html#653">401 U. S. 653</a></span> (1971), the doctrine has quite often been applied retroactively.  It is indisputable, however, that, in every case in which the Court has addressed the retroactivity problem in the context of the exclusionary rule, whereby concededly relevant evidence is excluded in order to enforce a constitutional guarantee that does not relate to the integrity of the factfinding process, the Court has concluded that any such new constitutional principle would be accorded only prospective application. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965); <em>Johnson v.

S. 797</a></span> (1971).</p>\n<p>We think that these cases tell us a great deal about the nature of the exclusionary rule, as well as something about the nature of retroactivity analysis.  Decisions of this Court applying the exclusionary rule to unconstitutionally seized evidence have referred to "the imperative of judicial integrity," <em>Elkins v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html">364 U. S. 206</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html#222">364 U. S. 222</a></span> (1960), although the Court has relied principally upon the deterrent purpose served by the exclusionary rule.  <em>See Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961); <em>Lee v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/378/case.html">392 U. S. 378</a></span> (1968); <em>see also United States v.

Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html">417 U. S. 433</a></span> (1974).  <em>And see also</em> Oaks, Studying the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 665, 668-672 (1970).</p>\n<p>When it came time to consider whether those decisions would be applied retroactively, however, the Court recognized that the introduction of evidence which had been seized by law enforcement officials in good faith compliance with then-prevailing constitutional norms did not make the courts "accomplices in the willful disobedience of a Constitution they are sworn to uphold."  <em>Elkins v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html#223">364 U. S. 223</a></span>.  Thus, while the "imperative of judicial integrity" played a role in this Court\'s decision to overrule <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html">338 U. S. 25</a></span> (1949), <em>see Mapp v. Ohio, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#659">367 U. S. 659</a></span>, the <em>Mapp</em> decision was not applied retroactively:</p>\n<p>"Rather than being abhorrent at the time of seizure in this case, the use in state trials of illegally seized evidence had been specifically authorized by this Court in <em>Wolf.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Linkletter v. Walker, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#638">381 U. S. 638</a></span> (footnote omitted).  Similarly, in <em>Lee v. Florida, supra,</em> this Court overruled <em>Schwartz v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/199/case.html">344 U. S. 199</a></span> (1952), and held that evidence seized in violation of \xc2\xa7 605 of the Federal Communications </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 422 U.

It is buttressed as well by the \'imperative of judicial integrity.\'  <em>Elkins v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/364/206/case.html">364 U.

Under our Constitution, no court, state or federal, may serve as an accomplice in the willful transgression of \'the Laws of the United States,\' laws by which \'the Judges in every State [are] bound. . . .\'"</p>\n<p>392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/378/case.html#385">392 U. S. 385</a></span>-386 (footnotes omitted).  But when it came time to consider the retroactivity of <em>Lee,</em> the Court held that it would not be applied retroactively, saying:</p>\n<p>"Retroactive application of <em>Lee</em> would overturn every state conviction obtained in good faith reliance on <em>Schwartz.</em>  Since this result is not required by the principle upon which <em>Lee</em> was decided, or necessary to accomplish its purpose, we hold that the exclusionary rule is to be applied only to trials in which the evidence is sought to be introduced after the date of our decision in <em>Lee.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Fuller v. Alaska, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/80/case.html#81">393 U. S. 81</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The teaching of these retroactivity cases is that, if the law enforcement officers reasonably believed in good faith that evidence they had seized was admissible at trial, the "imperative of judicial integrity" is not offended by the introduction into evidence of that material even if decisions subsequent to the search or seizure have broadened the exclusionary rule to encompass evidence seized in that manner.  It would seem to follow <em>a fortiori</em> from the <em>Linkletter</em> and <em>Fuller</em> holdings that the "imperative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 422 U. S. 538</a></p><p> of judicial integrity" is also not offended if law enforcement officials reasonably believed in good faith that their conduct was in accordance with the law even if decisions subsequent to the search or seizure have held that conduct of the type engaged in by the law enforcement officials is not permitted by the Constitution.  For, although the police in <em>Linkletter</em> and <em>Fuller</em> could not have been expected to foresee the application of the exclusionary rule to state criminal trials, they could reasonably have entertained no similar doubts as to the illegality of their conduct.  <em>See Wolf v. Colorado,</em> 338 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html#27">338 U. S. 27</a></span>; \xc2\xa7 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934; <em>cf. Nardone v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/379/case.html">302 U. S. 379</a></span> (1937).</p>\n<p>This approach to the "imperative of judicial integrity" does not differ markedly from the analysis the Court has utilized in determining whether the deterrence rationale undergirding the exclusionary rule would be furthered by retroactive application of new constitutional doctrines.  <em>See Linkletter v. Walker, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#636">381 U. S. 636</a></span>-637; <em>Fuller v. Alaska, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/80/case.html#81">393 U. S. 81</a></span>; <em>Desist v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#249">394 U. S. 249</a></span>-251.  In <em>Desist,</em> the Court explicitly recognized the interrelation between retroactivity rulings and the exclusionary rule:  "[W]e simply decline to extend the court-made exclusionary rule to cases in which its deterrent purpose would not be served."  394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#254">394 U. S. 254</a></span> n. 24.</p>\n<p>This focus in the retroactivity cases on the purposes served by the exclusionary rule is also quite in harmony with the approach taken generally to the exclusionary rule.  In <em>United States v. Calandra,</em> 414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#348">414 U. S. 348</a></span>, we said that the exclusionary rule</p>\n<p>"is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved."</p>\n<p>It follows that "the application of the rule has been restricted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 422 U. S. 539</a></p><p> to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We likewise observed in <em>Michigan v. Tucker,</em> 417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/433/case.html#447">417 U. S. 447</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right.  By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused.  Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force."</p>\n<p>The "reliability and relevancy," <em>Linkletter, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#639">381 U. S. 639</a></span>, of the evidence found in the trunk of respondent\'s car is unquestioned.  It was sufficiently damning on the issue of respondent\'s guilt or innocence that he stipulated in writing that, in effect, he had committed the offense charged.  Whether or not the exclusionary rule should be applied to the roving Border Patrol search conducted in this case, then, depends on whether considerations of either judicial integrity or deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations are sufficiently weighty to require that the evidence obtained by the Border Patrol in this case be excluded.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Border Patrol agents who stopped and searched respondent\'s automobile were acting pursuant to \xc2\xa7 287(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 233, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a)(3). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  That provision, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 422 U. S. 540</a></p><p> which carried forward statutory authorization dating back to 1946, 60 Stat. 865, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 110 (1946 ed.), [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] authorizes appropriately designated Immigration and Naturalization officers to search vehicles "within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States" without a warrant.  Pursuant to this statutory authorization, regulations were promulgated fixing the "reasonable distance," as specified in \xc2\xa7 287(a)(3), at "100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States," 22 Fed.Reg. 9808 (1957), as amended, 29 Fed.Reg. 13244 (1964), 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 287.1(a)(2) (1973).  Between 1952 and <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> roving Border Patrol searches under \xc2\xa7 287(a)(3) were upheld repeatedly against constitutional attack.

As MR. JUSTICE POWELL observed in his concurring opinion in <em>Almeida-Sanchez:</em></p>\n<p>"Roving automobile searches in border regions for aliens . . . have been consistently approved by the judiciary.

If the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct, then evidence obtained from a search should be suppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.  Admittedly, this uniform treatment of roving border patrol searches by the federal judiciary was overturned by this Court\'s decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em>  But in light of this history and of what we perceive to be the purpose of the exclusionary rule, we conclude that nothing in the Fourth Amendment, or in the exclusionary rule fashioned to implement it, requires that the evidence here be suppressed, even if we assume that respondent\'s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the search of his car.

JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s dissent also suggests that we were wrong to reverse the judgment affirming Almeida-Sanchez\' conviction if we uphold the judgment of conviction against Peltier.  But where it has been determined, as in a case such as <em>Linkletter,</em> that an earlier holding such as <em>Mapp</em> is not to be applied retroactively, it has not been questioned that Mapp was entitled to the benefit of the rule enunciated in her case.  <em>See Stovall v. Denno,</em> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/26/case.html#30">388 U. S. 300</a></span>-301.  Nor did the Government in <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> urge upon us any considerations of exclusionary rule policy independent of the merits of the Fourth Amendment question which we decided adversely to the Government.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>In its haste to extrapolate today\'s decision, that dissent argues that this decision will both "stop dead in its tracks judicial development of Fourth Amendment rights," since "the first duty of a court will be to deny the accused\'s motion to suppress if he cannot cite a case invalidating a search or seizure on identical facts" and add "a new layer of factfinding in deciding motions to suppress in the already heavily burdened federal courts."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#554">422 U.

Whether today\'s decision will reduce the responsibilities of district courts, as the dissent first suggests, or whether that burden will be increased, as the dissent also suggests, it surely will not fulfill both of these contradictory prophecies.  A fact not open to doubt is that the district courts are presently required, in hearing motions to suppress evidence, to spend substantial time addressing issues that do not go to a criminal defendant\'s guilt or innocence.  In this case, for example, the transcript of the suppression hearing takes almost three times as many pages in the Appendix as is taken by the transcript of respondent\'s trial.  App. 56.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with my Brother BRENNAN that <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html">413 U. S. 266</a></span> (1973), reaffirmed traditional Fourth Amendment principles, and that the purposes of the exclusionary rule compel exclusion of the unconstitutionally seized evidence in this case.  I adhere to my view that a constitutional rule made retroactive in one case must be applied retroactively in all.  <em>See</em> my dissent in <em>Daniel v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/31/case.html">420 U. S. 31</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/31/case.html#33">420 U. S. 33</a></span> (1975), and cases cited.  It is largely a matter of chance that we held the Border Patrol to the command of the Fourth Amendment in <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> rather than in the case of this defendant.  Equal justice does not permit a defendant\'s fate to depend upon such a fortuity.  The judgment below should be affirmed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 422 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/267/132/case.html">267 U.

First, the Court repeats the error of my Brother WHITE in his dissent in <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> in finding express congressional and administrative approval for random roving patrol searches.  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html#291">413 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html#292">413 U.

The statute, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a), only authorizes searches of vehicles "without warrant . . . within a reasonable distance from any external boundary"; nothing in the statute expressly dispenses with the necessity for showing probable cause.  The regulation, 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 287.1(a)(2) (1973), merely defined "a reasonable distance" as "within 100 air miles"; it, too, does not purport to exempt the Border Patrol from observing the probable cause requirement. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, the Court states that,</p>\n<p>"[b]etween 1952 and <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> roving Border Patrol searches under \xc2\xa7 287(a)(3) were upheld repeatedly against constitutional attack."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#540">422 U. S. 540</a></span>.  But the first decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit squarely in point, <em>United States v. Miranda,</em> 426 F.2d 283, was decided in 1970, and the second, <em>United States v. Almeida-Sanchez,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 422 U. S. 546</a></p><p> 452 F.2d 459, was decided over strong dissent in 1971 and was pending on certiorari in this Court when Peltier was searched.  406 U.S. 944 (1972).  The first decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit approving alien searches by roving patrols without either probable cause or any suspicious conduct was in 1969.  <em>Roa-Rodriquez v. United States,</em> 410 F.2d 1206.  And the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, unlike the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, always required at least a "reasonable suspicion" that a car might contain aliens as the basis of a valid search under 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a)(3).  <em>United States v. Wright,</em> 476 F.2d 1027, 1030, and n. 2 (1973), and cases cited.</p>\n<p>In addition, the rule of <em>Miranda, supra,</em> was a patent anomaly in the Courts of Appeals which sanctioned roving patrol searches without a showing even of suspicious circumstances.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, for example, held consistently that probable cause must be shown to validate a search for contraband except in a border search or its functional equivalent, <em>see, e.g., Cervantes v. United States,</em> 263 F.2d 800, 803 (1959); <em>Fumagalli v. United States,</em> 429 F.2d 1011 (1970), [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] and this despite a statutory authorization to search for contraband at least as broad as \xc2\xa7 1357(a)(3).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 422 U. S. 547</a></p><p> <em>See</em> 14 Stat. 178, 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 482. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Moreover, the Courts of Appeals require some measure of cause to suspect violation of law in interrogations and arrests authorized by other subsections of 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a).  <em>See Au Yi Lau v. INS,</em> 144 U.S.App.D.C. 147, 445 F.2d 217 (1971); <em>Yam Sang Kwai v. INS,</em> 133 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 411 F.2d 683 (1969).</p>\n<p>Given this history, it becomes quite clear why the Court has found it necessary to discard the "sharp break" test to reach the prospectivity question in this case.  For the approval by Courts of Appeals of this law enforcement practice was short-lived, less than unanimous, irreconcilable with other rulings of the same courts, and contrary to the explicit doctrine of this Court in <em>Carroll, supra,</em> as reaffirmed in <em>Brinegar v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/case.html">338 U.

If a case in this Court merely reaffirming longstanding precedent can ever constitute the "avulsive change [in] the current of the law" required before we even address the issue of prospectivity, <em>Hanover Shoe,</em> 392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html#499">392 U. S. 499</a></span>, surely <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> was not such a case. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 422 U. S. 548</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case is a good illustration of the dangers of addressing prospectivity where the "sharp break" standard is not met.  As this Court has recognized, applying a decision only prospectively [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] can entail inequity to others whose cases are here on direct review but are held pending decision of the case selected for decision.  <em>Stovall v.

Today the Court stands the <em>Linkletter</em> holding on its head by creating a class of cases in which nonretroactivity is the rule and not, as heretofore, the exception.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s stated reason for this remarkable departure from settled principles is "the policies underlying the [exclusionary] rule."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#534">422 U.

S. 365</a></span>.  My uneasiness approaches conviction after today\'s treatment of the rule.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion depends upon an entirely new understanding of the exclusionary rule in Fourth Amendment cases, one which, if the vague contours outlined today are filled in as I fear they will be, forecasts the complete demise of the exclusionary rule as fashioned by this Court in over 61 years of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  <em>See Weeks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html">232 U. S. 383</a></span> (1914). [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  An analysis of the Court\'s unsuccessfully veiled reformulation demonstrates that its apparent rush to discard 61 years of constitutional development has produced a formula difficult to comprehend and, on any understanding of its meaning, impossible to justify.</p>\n<p>The Court signals its new approach in these words:</p>\n<p>"If the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct, then evidence obtained from a search should be suppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#542">422 U. S. 542</a></span>.  True, the Court does not state in so many words that this formulation of the exclusionary rule is to be applied beyond the present retroactivity context.  But the proposition is stated generally and, particularly in view of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 422 U. S. 552</a></p><p> the concomitant expansion of prospectivity announced today,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#544">422 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> I have no confidence that the new formulation is to be confined to putative retroactivity cases.  Rather, I suspect that, when a suitable opportunity arises, today\'s revision of the exclusionary rule will be pronounced applicable to all search and seizure cases.  I therefore register my strong disagreement now.</p>\n<p>The new formulation obviously removes the very foundation of the exclusionary rule as it has been expressed in countless decisions.  Until now, the rule in federal criminal cases decided on direct review [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] has been that suppression is necessarily the sanction to be applied when it is determined that the evidence was, in fact, illegally acquired. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The revision unveiled today </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 422 U. S. 553</a></p><p> suggests that, instead of that single inquiry, district judges may also have to probe the subjective knowledge of the official who orders the search, and the inferences from existing law that official should have drawn. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The decision whether or not to order suppression would then turn upon whether, based on that expanded inquiry, suppression would comport with either the deterrence rationale of the exclusionary rule or "the imperative of judicial integrity." [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 422 U. S. 554</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On this reasoning, <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> itself was wrongly decided.  For if the Border Patrolmen who searched Peltier could not have known that they were acting unconstitutionally, and thus, could not have been deterred from the search by the possibility of the exclusion of the evidence from the trial, obviously the Border Patrolmen who searched Almeida-Sanchez several years earlier had no reason to be any more percipient.  If application of the exclusionary rule depends upon a showing that the particular officials who conducted or authorized a particular search knew or should have known that they were violating a specific, established constitutional right, the reversal of Almeida-Sanchez\' conviction was plainly error.</p>\n<p>Other defects of today\'s new formulation are also patent.  First, this new doctrine could stop dead in its tracks judicial development of Fourth Amendment rights.  For if evidence is to be admitted in criminal trials in the absence of clear precedent declaring the search in question unconstitutional, the first duty of a court will be to deny the accused\'s motion to suppress if he cannot cite a case invalidating a search or seizure on identical facts. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Yet even its opponents concede </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 422 U. S. 555</a></p><p> that the great service of the exclusionary rule has been its usefulness in forcing Judges to enlighten our understanding of Fourth Amendment guarantees.</p>\n<p>"It is . . . imperative to have a practical procedure by which courts can review alleged violations of constitutional rights and articulate the meaning of those rights.  The advantage of the exclusionary rule -- entirely apart from any direct deterrent effect -- is that it provides an occasion for judicial review, and it gives credibility to the constitutional guarantees.  By demonstrating that society will attach serious consequences to the violation of constitutional rights, the exclusionary rule invokes and magnifies the moral and educative force of the law.  Over the long-term, this may integrate some fourth amendment ideals into the value system or norms of behavior of law enforcement agencies."</p>\n<p>Oaks, Studying the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 665, 756 (1970) (hereafter Oaks).  <em>See also</em> Amsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 Minn.L.Rev. 349, 429-430 (1974) (hereafter Amsterdam).  While distinguished authority has suggested that an effective affirmative remedy could equally serve that function, <em>see</em> Oaks, <em>supra,</em> and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#420">403 U. S. 420</a></span>-423 (1971) (BURGER, C.J., dissenting), no equally effective alternative has yet been devised. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 422 U. S. 556</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, contrary to the Court\'s assumption, the exclusionary rule does not depend in its deterrence rationale on the punishment of individual law enforcement officials. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Indeed, one general fallacy in the reasoning of critics of the exclusionary rule is the belief that the rule is meant to deter official wrongdoers by punishment or threat of punishment.  It is also the fallacy of the Court\'s attempt today to outline a revision in the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p>Deterrence can operate in several ways.  The simplest is special or specific deterrence -- punishing an individual so that <em>he</em> will not repeat the same behavior.  But</p>\n<p>"[t]he exclusionary rule is not aimed at special deterrence, since it does not impose any direct punishment on a law enforcement official who has broken the rule. . . .  The exclusionary rule is aimed at affecting the wider audience of all law enforcement officials and society at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 422 U. S. 557</a></p><p> large.  It is meant to discourage violations by individuals who have never experienced any sanction for them."</p>\n<p>Oaks 709-710. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, the exclusionary rule, focused upon general, not specific, deterrence, depends not upon threatening a sanction for lack of compliance, but upon removing an inducement to violate Fourth Amendment rights.  <em>Elkins v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html">364 U. S. 206</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/case.html#217">364 U. S. 217</a></span> (1960), clearly explained that the exclusionary rule\'s</p>\n<p>"purpose is to deter -- to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way -- <em>by removing the incentive to disregard it.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>"A criminal court system functioning without an exclusionary rule . . . is the equivalent of a government purchasing agent paying premium prices for evidence branded with the stamp of unconstitutionality. . . .  If [the Government] receives the products of [illegal] searches and seizures . . . and uses them as the means of convicting people whom the officer conceives it to be his job to get convicted, it is not merely tolerating but <em>inducing</em> unconstitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 422 U. S. 558</a></p><p> searches and seizures."</p>\n<p>Amsterdam 431-432. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>We therefore might consider, in this light, what may have influenced the officials who authorized roving searches without probable cause under the supposed authority of 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1357(a)(3) and 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 287.1(a)(2) (1973). [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  The statute is, at best, ambiguous as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 422 U. S. 559</a></p><p> whether probable cause is required, though quite explicit that a warrant is not. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  The officials could therefore read the statute in one of two ways.  They could read it not to require probable cause, regard as irrelevant <em>Carroll v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/267/132/case.html">267 U. S. 132</a></span> (1925), requiring probable cause, though no warrant, before stopping and searching a moving automobile unless the search is at the border, and command their subordinates to stop at random any car within 100 miles of the border and search for illegal aliens.  Or they could conclude that, because the statute is silent about probable cause, and because <em>Carroll</em> seems to require it, they should instruct their subordinates to stop moving vehicles away from the border only if there is some good reason to believe that they contain illegal aliens.  Obviously, today\'s decision is a wide-open invitation to pursue the former course, because if this Court later decides that the officers guessed wrong in a particular case, one conviction will perhaps be lost, but many will have been gained, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#549">422 U. S. 549</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#554">422 U. S. 554</a></span>.  The concept of the exclusionary rule, until today, however, was designed to discourage officials from <em>invariably</em> opting for the choice that compromises Fourth Amendment rights, even though that rule has not worked perfectly as it did not in this case.</p>\n<p>"The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be <em>aided</em> by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 422 U. S. 560</a></p><p> suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land."</p>\n<p><em>Weeks,</em> 232 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#393">232 U. S. 393</a></span> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>Aside from this most fundamental error, solid practical reasons militate forcefully in favor of rejection of today\'s suggested road to revision of the exclusionary rule.  This Court has already rejected a case-by-case approach to the exclusionary rule.  After <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html">338 U. S. 25</a></span> (1949), had held the Fourth Amendment applicable to the States without also requiring the States to follow the exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks, Irvine v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/128/case.html">347 U. S. 128</a></span> (1954), presented the opportunity of compelling the States to apply <em>Weeks</em> in especially egregious situations such as <em>Irvine\'s.</em>  The Court rejected the opportunity because</p>\n<p>"a distinction of the kind urged would leave the rule so indefinite that no state court could know what it should rule in order to keep its processes on solid constitutional ground."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/128/case.html#134">347 U. S. 134</a></span> (opinion of Jackson, J.).  <em>See also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/128/case.html#138">347 U. S. 138</a></span> (Clark, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Today\'s formulation extended to all search and seizure cases would inevitably introduce the same uncertainty by adding a new layer of factfinding in deciding motions to suppress in the already heavily burdened federal courts.  The district courts would have to determine, and the appellate courts to review, subjective states of mind of numerous people, <em>see</em> <l=|422 18|="" 531fn2="" u.s.="">n. 18, <em>supra.,</em> and reasonable objective extrapolations of existing law, on each of the thousands of suppression motions presented each year. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  Nice questions will have to be faced, such as whether to exclude evidence obtained in a search which officers believed </l=|422></p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 422 U. S. 561</a></p><p> to be unconstitutional but which, in fact, was not, and whether to exclude evidence obtained in a search, in fact, unconstitutional and believed to be unconstitutional, but which the ordinary, reasonable police officer might well have believed was constitutional.  One criticism of the present formulation of the exclusionary rule is that it may deflect the inquiry in a criminal trial from the guilt of the defendant to the culpability of the police.  The formulation suggested today would vastly exacerbate this possibility, heavily burden the lower courts, and, worst of all, erode irretrievably the efficacy of the exclusion principle. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Indeed, "no [federal] court could know what it should rule in order to keep its processes on solid constitutional ground."  <em>Cf.</em> 347 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/128/case.html#134">347 U. S. 134</a></span>.  Because of the superficial and summary way that the Court treats the question the formulation will, I am certain, be unsatisfactory even to those convinced, as I am not, that the exclusionary rule must be drastically overhauled. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p>If a majority of my colleagues are determined to discard the exclusionary rule in Fourth Amendment cases, they should forthrightly do so, and be done with it.  This business of slow strangulation of the rule, with no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 422 U. S. 562</a></p><p> opportunity afforded parties most concerned to be heard, would be indefensible in any circumstances.  But to attempt covertly the erosion of an important principle over 61 years in the making as applied in federal courts clearly demeans the adjudicatory function, and the institutional integrity of this Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>This requirement has been variously stated.  <em>See, e.g., Desist v.

Thus, there is clear precedent for avoiding decision of a constitutional issue raised by police behavior when, in any event, the evidence was admissible in the particular case at bar.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Critics of the exclusionary rule emphasize that, in actual operation, law enforcement officials are rarely reprimanded, discharged, or otherwise disciplined when evidence is excluded at trial for search and seizure violations.  While this fact, to the extent it is true, may limit the efficacy of the exclusionary rule, it does not, for the reasons stated in the text, prove it useless.  Suggestions are emerging for tailoring the exclusionary rule to the adoption and enforcement of regulations and training procedures concerning searches and seizures by law enforcement agencies.  Amsterdam 409 <em>et seq.;</em> Kaplan, The Limits of the Exclusionary Rule, 26 Stan.L.Rev. 1027, 1050 <em>et seq.</em> (1974).  Today\'s approach, rather than advancing this goal, would diminish the incentive for law enforcement agencies to train and supervise subordinate officers.  <em>See id.</em> at 1044.  At any rate, to the extent law enforcement agencies do visit upon individual employees consequences for conducting searches and seizures which are later held illegal, the agencies can be expected to take account of the degree of departure from existing norms as elucidated in court decisions.  Thus, there is no need for the courts to adjust the exclusionary rule in order to assure fairness to individual officials or to promote decisiveness.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/16" name="F2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> Amsterdam 431:</p>\n<p>"The common focus on the concept of \'deterrence\' in the debate over the exclusionary rule can be quite misleading.  It suggests that the police have a God-given inclination to commit unconstitutional searches and seizures unless they are \'deterred\' from that behavior.  Once this assumption is indulged, it is easy enough to criticize the rule excluding unconstitutionally obtained evidence on the ground that it \'does not apply any direct sanction to the individual officer whose illegal conduct results in the exclusion,\' and so cannot \'deter\' him.  But no one, to my knowledge, has ever urged that the exclusionary rule is supportable on this principle of \'deterrence.\'  It is not supposed to \'deter\' in the fashion of the law of larceny, for example, by threatening punishment to him who steals a television set -- a theory of deterrence, by the way, whose lack of empirical justification makes the exclusionary rule look as solid by comparison as the law of gravity."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> Oaks 711:</p>\n<p>"\'The act is branded as reprehensible by authorized organs of society,\' Andenaes states, \'and this official branding of the conduct may influence attitudes quite apart from the fear of sanctions.\'  The existence and imposition of a sanction reinforces the rule and underlines the importance of observing it.  The principle is directly applicable to the exclusionary rule.  The salient defect in the rule of <em>Wolf v. Colorado</em> was the difficulty of persuading anyone that the guarantees of the fourth amendment were seriously intended and important when there was no sanction whatever for their violation.  As a visible expression of social disapproval for the violation of these guarantees, the exclusionary rule makes the guarantee of the fourth amendment credible.  Its example teaches the importance attached to observing them."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>I assume that the Court\'s statement that "the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#542">422 U. S. 542</a></span>, does not imply that deterrence can work only at the level of the individual officers on the scene, nor suggest that, under its approach, only the knowledge, real or constructive, of the official conducting the search is relevant.  Fourth Amendment violations become more, not less, reprehensible when they are the product of Government policy, rather than an individual policeman\'s errors of judgment.  <em>See Alderman v. United States,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html#203">394 U.

This protection is equally extended to the action of the <em>Government</em> and officers of the law acting under it. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Weeks v.

Obviously, any rule intended to prevent Fourth Amendment violations must operate not only upon individual law enforcement officers but also upon those who set policy for them and approve their actions.  Otherwise, for example, evidence derived from any search under a warrant could be admissible, because the searching policeman, having had a warrant approved by the designated judicial officer, had every reason to believe the warrant valid.  Certainly the Court can intend no such result, and would have lower courts inquire into the frame of mind, actual and constructive, of all officials whose actions were relevant to the search.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/19" name="F2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#545">422 U.
